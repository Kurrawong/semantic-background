The first one, consisting of a unique large OWL file, would remain the reference one. RiC-0 1.0 would also be provided as a set of files, in order to address specific needs,  e.g. using only the core of the ontology, or using only the individuals it defined and defining new individuals. So from December 2023, you can find the vocabulary on Documentary Form  Types, either in the unique large OWL RiC-O file, or as a separate file. " ;
    skos:scopeNote "For now this vocabulary only defines two top concepts; it should hopefully be completed later. The concepts defined in this vocabulary can be used in combination  with RiC-O classes and properties, whenever necessary and appropriate, to assign a documentary form type to a Record or a Record Part, using the rico:hasDocumentaryFormType object  property, or its inverse one. They also can be used to specify that a rico:RecordSet included or includes members whose some (rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType) or all (rico:hasOrHadAllMembersWithDocumentaryFormType) have some Documentary Form Type. Each concept is both defined as a skos:Concept and a rico:DocumentaryFormType, so that it is  possible to extend the classic definition of such concepts using RiC-O properties. For example, you can use rico:history, rico:date, or rico:isAssociatedWithPlace, rico:precedesInTime,  if you consider a documentary form type as being a historical entity, known and used in some known space or time region." ;

So from December 2023, you can find the vocabulary on Record Set Types,  either in the unique large OWL RiC-O file, or as a separate file. " ;
    skos:scopeNote "For now this vocabulary only defines four top concepts; it should hopefully be completed later. The concepts defined in this vocabulary can be used in combination  with RiC-O classes and properties, whenever necessary and appropriate, to assign a record set type to a Record Set, using the rico:hasRecordSetType object property, or its inverse one.  Each concept is both defined as a skos:Concept and a rico:RecordSetType, so that it is possible to extend the classic definition of such concepts using RiC-O properties. For example, you can use rico:history, rico:date, or rico:isAssociatedWithPlace, rico:precedesInTime, if you consider a record set type as being a historical entity, known and used in some known space or time region." ;

Producing a record resource may imply either its initial creation or a reuse of previous existing information by combination,  rearrangement, selecting, reformatting, etc. Record set, record, and record part are kinds of record resource. A record resource is evidence of the activity of an agent. More than one  agent may be involved in the creation of a record resource. The role of the agent in creating the record resource may take different forms, for example, authoring of an individual  record, accumulating a record set, or arranging a record set. Though a record, record set, and record part, under most circumstances, may be easily distinguished from one another,  identifying the boundary of each may frequently present particular challenges. Documentary forms provide the rules governing the structure of many types of records, providing criteria  for identifying a record's boundary, and identifying its essential parts. Many records, though, do not have well-established documentary forms, particularly in the case of digital  records, where it may be difficult to determine whether individual elements represented in separate bitstreams are record parts, records, or record sets. For example, is photographic  information represented independently in a bitstream embedded in a text document a record or a record part? Or is the same photographic information attached to an email that maintains  its independent representation, a record or a record part? Information grouped for some purpose, for example, ZIP or TAR \"file compression\" for saving storage space, presents a further challenge. One file comprises multiple bitstreams subjected to techniques that remove bits that can be losslessly recovered when decompressed. Under what circumstances is such a  compressed bitstream a record or a record set? Determining when an information object is a record, record set, or record part is based on perspective and judgement exercised in a  particular context. In one context, the agent describing an information object may designate it a record, while another agent in a different context may designate it a record part. Both  designations are supported by RiC-CM, and the significance of the difference for users of the records is ameliorated by the fact that all of the attributes and relations employed in  describing record and record part are shared, as are many of the attributes and relations employed in describing a record set." ;

    skos:scopeNote "A Record or Record Part must have been instantiated at least once, though this instantiation may no longer exist at the moment of description. An instantiation  might also exist at the moment of description, but be destroyed at a later moment in time, when, for example, a derived instantiation might become the only remaining instantiation. A  Record Set may have an instantiation, which is to say that it is not a necessary condition. An Instantiation may be derived from another Instantiation. A Record Resource may have many  Instantiations simultaneously (for instance, a record printed and saved in the same time as DOCX and PDF/A would have 3 concurrent instantiations) or through time (for example, copy of a record). Depending on the context, a new instantiation may be seen as a new or as the same record resource. During in the process of re-instantiation something is lost and something is  preserved, but it is up to the context and the Agent that produces or uses that Instantiation to assess whether the two instantiations are functionally equivalent or not. For instance, a postcard representing a town map from 1874 (Instantiation 1) is digitized and kept as a JPEG file (Instantiation 2). The digital copy may be considered as instantiating the \"same\" Record by an Agent considering the  information transmitted by the Record (e.g., the urban landscape displayed), but as a\" different\" Record by an antiquarian more focused on the materiality of the carrier. Successive  instantiations may change the perceivable boundaries of a Record Resource. For instance, a case file comprising many records may be digitized and saved as one single PDF file, which,  from management perspective, may be treated as one Record. Similarly, a large Record Set (a fonds or a series) may be maintained as one database. On the other hand, one record (main  document and its annexes) may be digitized in separate files and each one may be managed as a discrete “physical” item. Instantiations may require mediation to communicate the  information in the Record Resource. While a traditional Record on paper can simply be read by an Agent in order to understand the information, a vinyl recording, a video cassette or a  digital file needs a device (mediator) to codify or decodify the information conveyed. This mediator may imply simple physical components (a turntable needle, for example), or a complex  gallery of software and hardware elements. Instantiations are more than the mere informational content of Record Resource and may be the focus of preservation and physical management of  records. The use of particular document types for records, such as a medieval charter, may have implications for the authenticity of the records. Hence, the way a Record Resource is  instantiated contributes to the contextualizing of the content.record resource is instantiated contributes to the contextualizing the content. Distinguishing the message conveyed (Record Resource) and its physical representations (Instantiation) allows for the efficient management of their descriptions, and preserve information about a Record Resource even when no  physical representation of it exists or is known to exist anymore. The relations between distinct instantiations can then be expressed wherever they coexist, and they can be related to  the Record Resource they instantiate." ;

    skos:scopeNote "An Agent may have one or more identities; an identity is a constellation of properties or relations that together “identify” the Agent. A Person or Group commonly has one identity, though each also may have one or more alternative identities. Such alternative identities may be shared by more than one Person or Group. Alternative identities include but are not limited to pseudonyms, heteronyms, DBA (Doing Business As), and trade identities. An alternative identity should not be confused with a Position in a Group, for example,  presidents, prime ministers, governors, popes, royalty, or bishops. Nor should an alternative identity be confused with a variant name or identifier of the same identity. Agent also  includes entities created by a Person or Group that act on behalf of the creating Agent in an autonomous or semi-autonomous manner.
