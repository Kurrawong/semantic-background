    skos:historyNote "This vocabulary was created within the Records in Contexts Ontology. When the ICA/EGAD developed RiC-O 1.0, it was decided that two versions of RiC-O would be  released. The first one, consisting of a unique large OWL file, would remain the reference one. RiC-0 1.0 would also be provided as a set of files, in order to address specific needs,  e.g. using only the core of the ontology, or using only the individuals it defined and defining new individuals. So from December 2023, you can find the vocabulary on Documentary Form  Types, either in the unique large OWL RiC-O file, or as a separate file. " ;
    skos:scopeNote "For now this vocabulary only defines two top concepts; it should hopefully be completed later. The concepts defined in this vocabulary can be used in combination  with RiC-O classes and properties, whenever necessary and appropriate, to assign a documentary form type to a Record or a Record Part, using the rico:hasDocumentaryFormType object  property, or its inverse one. They also can be used to specify that a rico:RecordSet included or includes members whose some (rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType) or all (rico:hasOrHadAllMembersWithDocumentaryFormType) have some Documentary Form Type. Each concept is both defined as a skos:Concept and a rico:DocumentaryFormType, so that it is  possible to extend the classic definition of such concepts using RiC-O properties. For example, you can use rico:history, rico:date, or rico:isAssociatedWithPlace, rico:precedesInTime,  if you consider a documentary form type as being a historical entity, known and used in some known space or time region." ;
