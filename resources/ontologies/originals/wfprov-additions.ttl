wfprov:Artifact
    rdfs:comment "Artifact is a general concept that represents immutable piece of state, which may have a physical embodiment in a physical object, or a digital representation in a computer system. In the case of wfprov, an artifact is used as input to a process run, or produced by the output of a process run."@en ;

wfprov:ProcessRun
    rdfs:comment "A process run is a particular execution of a wfdesc:Process description (wfprov:describedByProcess), which can wfprov:usedInput some wfprov:Artifact instances, and produce new artifacts (wfprov:wasOutputFrom). A wfprov:WorkflowRun is a specialisation of this class."@en ;

wfprov:WorkflowEngine
    rdfs:comment "A workflow engine is an foaf:Agent that is responsible for enacting a workflow definition (which could be described in a wfdesc:Workflow). The result of workflow enactment gives rise to a wfprov:WorkflowRun."@en ;

wfprov:WorkflowRun
    rdfs:comment "A workflow run is a wfprov:ProcessRun which have been enacted by a wfprov:WorkflowEngine, according to a workflow definition (which could be wfdesc:describedByWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow).

    schema:description """The wfprov ontology shows how to express minimal provenance information about the execution of a workflow described using the wf ontology.

Here the concern is mainly the provenance which affects the research object, so in particular how some ro:Resource's might have been generated or used by the execution of a wfdesc:Workflow.

The main class here is a wfprov:WorkflowRun which shows how wfprov:Artifact instances (the data) wfprov:wasOutputFrom a wfprov:ProcessRun for generated artifacts, or wfprov:usedInput for consumed artifacts. The WorkflowRun is also a ProcessRun, and so the overall inputs and outputs of thw workflow execution can be described in the same manner.

These provenance details are linked to the corresponding wfdesc descriptions using wfdesc:describedbyProcess, wfdesc:describedByWorkflow and wfdesc:describedByParameter.

This ontology can be further linked to more specific provenance ontologies like OPM-V or W3C PROV-O, but this should be done separately.""" ;
