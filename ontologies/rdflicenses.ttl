If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

        Artistic License 2.0
Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.
Definitions
"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.
"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.
"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.
"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.
"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.
"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.
Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.
(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
(i) the Original License or
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source
(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.
Aggregating or Linking the Package
(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.
General Provisions
(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.
(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.
(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
4.3. Modified Versions.

6. TERMINATION.
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    cc:legalcode """
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

European Union Public Licence
V. 1.1
EUPL © the European Community 2007
This European Union Public Licence (the “EUPL”) applies to the Work or Software
(as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the
Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use
is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).
The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright
notice for the Original Work:
Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1
or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.
1. Definitions
In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:
- The Licence: this Licence.
- The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated
by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable
Code as the case may be.
- Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee,
based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define
the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to
classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law
applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.
- The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.
- The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
convenient for people to study and modify.
- The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is
meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.
- The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the
Work under the Licence.
- Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the
Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work. 
- The Licensee or “You”: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the
Software under the terms of the Licence.
- Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting,
distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or
off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the
disposal of any other natural or legal person.
2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence
The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable
licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the
Original Work:
- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
- reproduce the Work,
- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the
Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be,
the Work,
- distribute the Work or copies thereof,
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.
Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.
In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his
moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the
economic rights here above listed.
The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any
patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted
on the Work under this Licence.
3. Communication of the Source Code
The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable
Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the
Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright
notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely
accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the
Work. 
4. Limitations on copyright
Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any
exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original
Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations
thereto.
5. Obligations of the Licensee
The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations
imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:
Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks
notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.
The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with
every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must
cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been
modified and the date of modification.
Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution
and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later
version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose
any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or
restrict the terms of the Licence.
Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative
Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be
done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,
“Compatible Licence” refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this
Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict
with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence
shall prevail.
Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or
indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long
as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.
Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing
the content of the copyright notice. 
6. Chain of Authorship
The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power
and authority to grant the Licence.
Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the
Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and
authority to grant the Licence.
Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors
grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this
Licence.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or “bugs”
inherent to this type of software development.
For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is” basis and
without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,
accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as
stated in Article 6 of this Licence.
This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the
grant of any rights to the Work.
8. Disclaimer of Liability
Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work,
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor
has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.
9. Additional agreements
While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this
Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own
behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such
Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. 
10. Acceptance of the Licence
The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree”
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable
law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
Licence and all of its terms and conditions.
Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by
exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of
the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.
11. Information to the public
In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a
remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at
least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding
the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and
reproduced by the Licensee.
12. Termination of the Licence
The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any
breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.
Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the
Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full
compliance with the Licence.
13. Miscellaneous
Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement
between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.
If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision
will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.
The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions
of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of
the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with
a unique version number.
All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have
identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice. 
14. Jurisdiction
Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the
European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in
article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and
resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary
business.
15. Applicable Law
This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the
Licensor resides or has his registered office.
This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:
- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any
Licensee;
- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or
registered office inside a European Union country.

IBM Public License Version 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:
in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the Original Program, and
in the case of each Contributor,
changes to the Program, and
additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.
"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
its license agreement:
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:
it must be made available under this Agreement; and
a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:
Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.
2.2. Effective Date
The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
2.4. Subsequent Licenses
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
2.5. Representation
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
2.6. Fair Use
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
2.7. Conditions
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
3. Responsibilities
3.1. Distribution of Source Form
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
3.4. Notices
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
3.5. Application of Additional Terms
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5. Termination
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
6. Disclaimer of Warranty
Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
7. Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
8. Litigation
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
9. Miscellaneous
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
10. Versions of the License
10.1. New Versions
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
10.2. Effect of New Versions
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
10.3. Modified Versions
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice
This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

personal data in the Information;
Information that has neither been published nor disclosed under information access legislation (including the Freedom of Information Acts for the UK and Scotland) by or with the consent of the Information Provider;

‘Information Provider’
means the person or organisation providing the Information under this licence.

About this Licence
The Controller of Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) has developed this licence as a tool to enable Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use of their Information under a common non-commercial licence. The Controller invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this licence where licensing under the default Open Government Licence is not appropriate.
The Controller of HMSO has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the Crown.
This is version 1.0 of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. The Controller of HMSO may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. However, you may continue to use Information licensed under this version should you wish to do so.
Further context, best practice and guidance can be found in the UK Government Licensing Framework section on The National Archives website.

about the open lIcence 
Etalab is the task force under the French Prime Minister’s authority leading Open Government Data

Within the scope of their public service missions, public sector bodies produce and receive public sector 
information, which may be re-used by any natural or legal person. 
Under the terms of French Law, are not considered public sector information : information the communication of which is not a right under information access legislation ; information contained in documents produced or received by public sector bodies exercising a public service of industrial or commercial character ; and information contained in documents over which third parties hold intellectual property rights, 
Information which contains personal data is not considered to be public sector information re-usable under 
the terms of French Law – except where persons on which data is collected have agreed to its reuse, where 
this data has been rendered anonymous by the public sector bodies, or where a legal or statutory provision 
permits its re-use (in these three cases, re-use is subject to compliance with French privacy protection legislation). 
This licence is version 1.0 of the Open Licence. Etalab may, from time to time, offer new versions of the Open Licence. However, re-users may continue to re-use information available under this licence 
if they wish to do so.

À propos de La Licence ouVerte 
Etalab est la mission chargée sous l’autorité du Premier ministre d’ouvrir le plus grand nombre de données publiques des administrations de l’Etat et de ses établissements publics. Elle a réalisé la Licence Ouverte pour faciliter la réutilisation libre et gratuite de ces informations publiques, telles 
que définies par l’article 10 de la loi n°78-753 du 17 juillet 1978. 
Dans le cadre de leurs missions de service public, les administrations produisent ou reçoivent 
des informations publiques qui peuvent être réutilisées par toute personne physique ou morale 
à d’autres fins que celles de la mission de service public. 
Ne sont pas des informations publiques au sens de la loi du 17 juillet 1978 les informations contenues dans des documents dont la communication ne constitue pas un droit (en application de la loi du 17 juillet 1978 ou d’autres dispositions législatives, sauf si ces informations font l’objet d’une diffusion publique), celles contenues dans des documents produits ou reçus par les administrations dans l’exercice d’une mission de service public à caractère industriel ou commercial, et celles contenues dans des documents sur lesquels des tiers détiennent des droits de propriété intellectuelle. 
Ne sont également pas des informations publiques susceptibles d’être réutilisées celles 
qui contiennent des données à caractère personnel, sauf lorsque les personnes intéressées 
y ont consenti, ou lorsqu’elles ont fait l’objet d’une anonymisation par l’administration, ou lorsqu’une 
disposition légale ou réglementaire le permet (dans ces trois cas, la réutilisation est subordonnée 
au respect de la loi n°78-17 du 6 janvier 1978). 
Cette licence est une version 1.0 de la Licence Ouverte. Etalab se réserve la faculté de proposer 
de nouvelles versions de la Licence Ouverte. Cependant, les réutilisateurs pourront continuer à réutiliser les informations disponibles sous cette licence s’ils le souhaitent.

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition.

Academic Free License ("AFL") v. 3.0
This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:
Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0
1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:
a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;
b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;
c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your choice that does not contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor's reserved rights and remedies, in this Academic Free License;
d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
e) to display the Original Work publicly.
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.
8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).
10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the "Academic Free License" or "AFL" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.

                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                            Preamble
  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.
  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.
  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.
  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  0. Definitions.
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
  1. Source Code.
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.
  2. Basic Permissions.
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
  7. Additional Terms.
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
  8. Termination.
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
  11. Patents.
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  16. Limitation of Liability.
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

License
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

License
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
"Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
"Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

DER GEGENSTAND DIESER LIZENZ (WIE UNTER "SCHUTZGEGENSTAND" DEFINIERT) WIRD UNTER DEN BEDINGUNGEN DIESER CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL", "LIZENZ" ODER "LIZENZVERTRAG") ZUR VERFÜGUNG GESTELLT. DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER ANDERE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT. JEDE FORM DER NUTZUNG DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, DIE NICHT AUFGRUND DIESER LIZENZ ODER DURCH GESETZE GESTATTET IST, IST UNZULÄSSIG.
DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINES DURCH DIESE LIZENZ GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH EINVERSTANDEN. SOWEIT DIESE LIZENZ ALS LIZENZVERTRAG ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ GENANNTEN RECHTE UNENTGELTLICH UND IM AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN AKZEPTIEREN.
1. Definitionen
Der Begriff "Bearbeitung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange dieses erkennbar vom Schutzgegenstand abgeleitet wurde. Dies kann insbesondere auch eine Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes.
Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.
"Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Bearbeitungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt.
"Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und eine Erteilung, Übertragung oder Einräumung von Nutzungsbewilligungen bzw Nutzungsrechten an Dritte erlaubt.
Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art oder ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" im Sinne dieser Lizenz.
Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährte Nutzungsbewilligung trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben.
Unter "Öffentlich Wiedergeben" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Wahrnehmbarmachungen des Schutzgegenstandes in unkörperlicher Form zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung oder zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zurverfügungstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.
"Vervielfältigen"im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, gleichviel in welchem Verfahren, auf welchem Träger, in welcher Menge und ob vorübergehend oder dauerhaft, Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch das erstmalige Festhalten des Schutzgegenstandes oder dessen Wahrnehmbarmachung auf Mitteln der wiederholbaren Wiedergabe sowie das Herstellen von Vervielfältigungsstücken dieser Festhaltung, sowie die Speicherung einer geschützten Darbietung oder eines Bild- und/oder Schallträgers in digitaler Form oder auf einem anderen elektronischen Medium.
2. Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte
Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die sich aus den Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte, anderen Beschränkungen der Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers oder anderen entsprechenden Rechtsnormen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung
Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz erteilt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 4.e) - die vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte Nutzungsbewilligung, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art und Weise zu nutzen:
den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; und
den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten.
Die vorgenannte Nutzungsbewilligung wird für alle bekannten sowie alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Sie beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich vom Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf die Geltendmachung sämtlicher daraus resultierender Rechte.
4. Bedingungen
Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dasselbe gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen.
Die Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Abschnitt 3 gilt nur für Handlungen, die nicht vorrangig einem kommerziellen Zweck dienen ("nicht-kommerzielle Nutzung", "Non-commercial-Option"). Wird Ihnen in Zusammenhang mit dem Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz ein anderer Schutzgegenstand überlassen, ohne dass eine vertragliche Verpflichtung hierzu besteht (etwa im Wege von File-Sharing), so wird dies nicht als vorrangig einem kommerziellen Zweck dienend angesehen, wenn in Verbindung mit dem Austausch der Schutzgegenstände tatsächlich keine Zahlung oder geldwerte Vergütung geleistet wird.
Die Verbreitung und die öffentliche Wiedergabe des Schutzgegenstandes oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie – soweit bekannt – Folgendes angeben:  
Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers, und/oder falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ("Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
den Titel des Inhaltes;
in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand.
Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung aller Beitragenden dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Urhebers, des Lizenzgebers und/oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder implizit noch explizit irgendeine Verbindung mit dem oder eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch den Lizenzgeber oder den Zuschreibungsempfänger andeuten oder erklären.
Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen.
Bezüglich der Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie geltend zu machen.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche für den Fall, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke ausüben geltend zu machen, verzichtet für alle übrigen Fälle lizenzgerechter Nutzung jedoch auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Geltendmachung der Vergütungsansprüche durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch das ausschließliche Recht auf Geltendmachung des entsprechenden Vergütungsanspruches (durch ihn selbst oder eine Verwertungsgesellschaft) für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke ausüben.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collection" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole. A Collection may, for example, include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purposes of this Licence.
"Commercial" means primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyright works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be Commercial, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyright works.
"Derivative Work" means material in any form that is created by editing, modifying or adapting the Work, a substantial part of the Work, or the Work and other pre-existing works. Derivative Works may, for example, include a translation, adaptation, musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be transformed or adapted, except that a Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public by any means, including publication, electronic communication, or broadcast.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this Licence.
"Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work.
"Reproduce" means to make a copy of the Work in any material form (eg storage in digital form).
"Work" means the material (including any work or other subject matter) protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. This may include (without limitation) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; a sound recording or cinematograph film; a published edition of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or a television or sound broadcast.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights
Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions under copyright law or any other applicable laws.
3. Licence Grant
3A Grant of Rights
Provided that the terms set out in this Licence are satisfied, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the following rights:
Reproduce the Work;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any Collection;
Distribute and publicly perform the Work or the Work as incorporated in any Collection.
3B Media, Formats and No Derivative Works
The above rights may be exercised in any media or format whether now known or hereafter created. They include the right to make modifications that are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Other than such technical modifications, You have no rights to make Derivative Works.
3C Other Rights Reserved
All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved. This includes the right to collect royalties, whether individually or via a licensing body such as a collecting society, for any Commercial use of the Work. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
4. Restrictions
The licence granted above is limited by the following restrictions.
4A Restrictions on Distribution and Public Performance of the Work
You may Distribute and publicly perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
You are not granted the right to sublicense the Work. The rights of recipients of the Work from You are governed by clause 9.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, You must not impose any technological measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other material within the Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work itself, to be made subject to this Licence.
4B Restrictions on Commercial Use
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You by clause 3 above in any Commercial manner.
4C Attribution and Notice Requirements
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Collection You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Collection You must provide, in a manner reasonable to the medium or means You are using:
the name or pseudonym (if provided) of the Original Author and/or of any other party (such as a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal) that the Original Author or Licensor has requested be attributed (such as in the copyright notice or terms of use). In this clause 4C these parties are referred to as "Attribution Parties";
the title of the Work (if provided); and
to the extent reasonably practicable, any Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) that the Licensor specifies should be associated with the Work that refers to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
In the case of a Collection, the above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part of any credits for other contributing authors and be as prominent as the credits for those other authors.
You must, to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any Collection if requested to do so by the Licensor or Original Author.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this clause 4C for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above. By exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must not assert or imply:
any connection between the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party and You or Your use of the Work; or
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party of You or Your use of the Work,
without their separate, express prior written permission.
4D Moral Rights
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4D, "moral rights" means the personal rights granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have authorship falsely attributed.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Work "as-is" and makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, any representations, warranties or conditions regarding:
the contents or accuracy of the Work;
title, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose;
non-infringement;
the absence of latent or other defects; or
the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, imply certain warranties and conditions in certain circumstances, such as the right to supply or fitness for purpose of goods or services supplied to a consumer. Clause 5(a) cannot and is not intended to exclude, restrict or modify these warranties.
6. Limit of Liability
To the full extent permitted by applicable law, and except for any liability arising from contrary agreement, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal basis (including without limitation, negligence) for any loss or damage whatsoever, including (without limitation):
loss of production or operation time, loss, damage or corruption of data or records; or
loss of anticipated savings, opportunity, revenue, profit or goodwill, or other economic loss; or
any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Licence or the use of the Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
If applicable legislation implies warranties or conditions, or imposes obligations or liability on the Licensor in respect of this Licence that cannot be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified, the Licensor’s liability is limited, to the full extent permitted by the applicable legislation, at its option, to:
in the case of goods, any one or more of the following:
the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
the repair of the goods;
the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;
the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
in the case of services:
the supplying of the services again; or
the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, restrict the limitation of liability in certain circumstances, such as a contract for the supply of goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic, or household use. Clauses 6(a) and 6(b) cannot and are not intended to apply in circumstances where it is prohibited by law.
7. Termination
This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals or entities who have received a Collection from You pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided they remain in full compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of this Licence.
8. Licensor’s Rights Retained
Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such release will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work from You
Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or a Collection the Licensor offers the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms as are granted to You under this Licence.
10. Severability
If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence. Without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
11. Waivers and Consents
No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the relevant party.
12. Entire Agreement
This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. To the full extent permitted by law, there are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may not be modified without the written agreement of the Licensor and You.
13. Governing Law
The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by the laws in force in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.
Creative Commons Notice
Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, makes no representation or warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor. Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the Licence, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons’ then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

A troca da Obra por outros materiais protegidos por direito autoral através de compartilhamento digital de arquivos ou de outras formas não deverá ser considerada como intencionada ou direcionada à obtenção de vantagens comerciais ou compensação monetária privada, desde que não haja pagamento de nenhuma compensação monetária com relação à troca de Obras protegidas por direito de autor.
Se Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra ou Obra Coletiva, Você deve, a menos que um pedido relacionado à Seção 4(a) tenha sido feito, manter intactas todas as informações relativas a direitos autorais sobre a Obra e exibir, de forma razoável em relação ao meio ou mídia por Você utilizado: (i) o nome do Autor Original (ou seu pseudônimo, se for o caso), se fornecido, do Titular de Direitos Conexos, se fornecido e quando aplicável, e/ou, ainda, se o Autor Original/Titular de Direitos Conexos e/ou o Licenciante designar outra parte ou partes (p. ex.: um instituto patrocinador, editora, periódico) para atribuição (“Partes de Atribuição”) nas informações relativas aos direitos autorais do Licenciante, termos de serviço ou por outros meios razoáveis, o nome dessa parte ou partes; (ii) o título da Obra, se fornecido; (iii) na medida do razoável, o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante especificar para estar associado à Obra, se houver, exceto se o URI não se referir ao aviso de direitos autorais ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento da Obra. O crédito exigido por esta Seção 4(c), pode ser implementado de qualquer forma razoável; desde que, entretanto, no caso de uma Obra Coletiva, na indicação de crédito feita aos autores participantes da Obra Coletiva, o crédito apareça como parte dessa indicação, e de modo ao menos tão proeminente quanto os créditos para os outros autores participantes. De modo a evitar dúvidas, Você apenas poderá fazer uso do crédito exigido por esta Seção para o propósito de atribuição na forma estabelecida acima e, ao exercer Seus direitos sob esta Licença, Você não poderá implícita ou explicitamente afirmar ou sugerir qualquer vínculo, patrocínio ou apoio do Autor Original, Titular de Direitos Conexos, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição, o que for cabível, por Você ou Seu uso da Obra, sem a prévia e expressa autorização do Autor Original, Titular de Direitos Conexos, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição.
O Licenciante reserva para si o direito de recolher royalties, seja individualmente ou, na hipótese de o Licenciante ser membro de uma sociedade de gestão coletiva de direitos (por exemplo, ECAD, ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via essa sociedade, por qualquer exercício Seu sobre os direitos concedidos sob esta Licença, desde que esse exercício seja para um propósito ou uso comercial, conforme definido pela Seção 4(b).
Na extensão em que reconhecidos e considerados indisponíveis pela legislação aplicável, direitos morais não são afetados por esta Licença.
5. Declarações, garantias e exoneração 
EXCETO QUANDO FOR DE OUTRA FORMA MUTUAMENTE ACORDADO PELAS PARTES POR ESCRITO, O LICENCIANTE OFERECE A OBRA “NO ESTADO EM QUE SE ENCONTRA” (AS IS) E NÃO PRESTA QUAISQUER GARANTIAS OU DECLARAÇÕES DE QUALQUER ESPÉCIE RELATIVAS À OBRA, SEJAM ELAS EXPRESSAS OU IMPLÍCITAS, DECORRENTES DA LEI OU QUAISQUER OUTRAS, INCLUINDO, SEM LIMITAÇÃO, QUAISQUER GARANTIAS SOBRE A TITULARIDADE DA OBRA, ADEQUAÇÃO PARA QUAISQUER PROPÓSITOS, NÃO-VIOLAÇÃO DE DIREITOS, OU INEXISTÊNCIA DE QUAISQUER DEFEITOS LATENTES, ACURACIDADE, PRESENÇA OU AUSÊNCIA DE ERROS, SEJAM ELES APARENTES OU OCULTOS. EM JURISDIÇÕES QUE NÃO ACEITEM A EXCLUSÃO DE GARANTIAS IMPLÍCITAS, ESTAS EXCLUSÕES PODEM NÃO SE APLICAR A VOCÊ.
6. Limitação de responsabilidade. EXCETO NA EXTENSÃO EXIGIDA PELA LEI APLICÁVEL, EM NENHUMA CIRCUNSTÂNCIA O LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PARA COM VOCÊ POR QUAISQUER DANOS, ESPECIAIS, INCIDENTAIS, CONSEQÜENCIAIS, PUNITIVOS OU EXEMPLARES, ORIUNDOS DESTA LICENÇA OU DO USO DA OBRA, MESMO QUE O LICENCIANTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO SOBRE A POSSIBILIDADE DE TAIS DANOS.
7. Terminação
Esta Licença e os direitos aqui concedidos terminarão automaticamente no caso de qualquer violação dos termos desta Licença por Você. Pessoas físicas ou jurídicas que tenham recebido Obras Coletivas de Você sob esta Licença, entretanto, não terão suas licenças terminadas desde que tais pessoas físicas ou jurídicas permaneçam em total cumprimento com essas licenças. As Seções 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 subsistirão a qualquer terminação desta Licença.
Sujeito aos termos e condições dispostos acima, a licença aqui concedida é perpétua (pela duração do direito autoral aplicável à Obra). Não obstante o disposto acima, o Licenciante reserva-se o direito de difundir a Obra sob termos diferentes de licença ou de cessar a distribuição da Obra a qualquer momento; desde que, no entanto, quaisquer destas ações não sirvam como meio de retratação desta Licença (ou de qualquer outra licença que tenha sido concedida sob os termos desta Licença, ou que deva ser concedida sob os termos desta Licença) e esta Licença continuará válida e eficaz a não ser que seja terminada de acordo com o disposto acima.
8. Outras disposições
Cada vez que Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra ou uma Obra Coletiva, o Licenciante oferece ao destinatário uma licença da Obra nos mesmos termos e condições que a licença concedida a Você sob esta Licença.
Se qualquer disposição desta Licença for tida como inválida ou não-executável sob a lei aplicável, isto não afetará a validade ou a possibilidade de execução do restante dos termos desta Licença e, sem a necessidade de qualquer ação adicional das partes deste acordo, tal disposição será reformada na mínima extensão necessária para tal disposição tornar-se válida e executável.
Nenhum termo ou disposição desta Licença será considerado renunciado e nenhuma violação será considerada consentida, a não ser que tal renúncia ou consentimento seja feito por escrito e assinado pela parte que será afetada por tal renúncia ou consentimento.
Esta Licença representa o acordo integral entre as partes com respeito à Obra aqui licenciada. Não há entendimentos, acordos ou declarações relativas à Obra que não estejam especificados aqui. O Licenciante não será obrigado por nenhuma disposição adicional que possa aparecer em quaisquer comunicações provenientes de Você. Esta Licença não pode ser modificada sem o mútuo acordo, por escrito, entre o Licenciante e Você.

Lizenz 
 
Durch die Ausübung eines durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechts an dem Lizenzgegenstand erklären Sie sich mit den Lizenzbedingungen rechtsverbindlich einverstanden. Soweit diese Lizenz als Vertrag anzusehen ist, gewährt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber die in der Lizenz genannten Rechte unentgeltlich und im Austausch dafür, dass Sie das Gebundensein an die Lizenzbedingungen akzeptieren. 
 
Der „Lizenzgeber“, d.h. die Person, welche den Lizenzgegenstand unter dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung stellt, 
 
und 
 
„Sie“, d.h. die natürliche oder juristische Person, welche die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannten Nutzungen des Lizenzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand nicht gegen die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstossen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstosses auszuüben, 
 
vereinbaren mit dieser Creative Commons Public License („CCPL“ oder „Lizenz“) die Nutzungsbedingungen für den Lizenzgegenstand, 
 
im Einzelnen: 
 
1. Definitionen 
 
„Lizenzgegenstand“ kann ein urheberrechtlich geschütztes Werk sein oder eine durch verwandte Schutzrechte geschützte Leistung. 
Eine „Sammlung“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist eine Zusammenstellung des Lizenzgegenstands mit anderen Werken oder sonstigen Elementen, unabhängig davon, ob an der Sammlung selbst aufgrund der Anordnung oder der Auswahl des Inhalts ein Urheberrecht entsteht. Als Sammlung gelten auch Datenbanken, unabhängig davon, ob an der Datenbank selbst aufgrund der Anordnung oder der Auswahl des Inhalts ein Urheberrecht entsteht. Die Aufnahme des Lizenzgegenstandes in eine Sammlung gilt nicht als Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes. 
Eine „Abwandlung“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist jede Veränderung des Lizenzgegenstandes, insbesondere eine Umgestaltung, Bearbeitung, Änderung, Anpassung oder Übersetzung, solange der Lizenzgegenstand in seinem individuellen Charakter erkennbar bleibt. Nicht als Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes gilt seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung. 
„Rechteinhaber“ ist der Urheber des Lizenzgegenstandes, der Inhaber verwandter Schutzrechte oder jede andere Person, die am Lizenzgegenstand Nutzungsrechte erlangt hat, welche die Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder die Weiterübertragung der Nutzungsrechte an Dritte erlauben. 
Ein „Werk“ ist eine geistige Schöpfung mit individuellem Charakter. 
Ein „verwandtes Schutzrecht“ ist ein Recht an einer kulturellen Leistung, welche nicht als Werk geschützt ist, wie etwa jene von ausübenden Künstlern, Herstellern von Ton- und Tonbildträgern oder Sendeunternehmen. 
„Öffentlich Wiedergeben“ ist das Vortragen des Lizenzgegenstandes direkt oder mit irgendwelchen Mitteln, das Aufführen, das Vorführen, das anderswo Wahrnehmbarmachen oder das Zugänglichmachen in der Weise, dass Personen von Orten und zu Zeiten ihrer Wahl dazu Zugang haben. 
„Vervielfältigen“ bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren vorübergehende oder dauerhafte Vervielfältigungsstücke des Lizenzgegenstandes herzustellen und umfasst auch den Vorgang der erstmaligen körperlichen Fixierungen des Lizenzgegenstandes und der Herstellung von Vervielfältigungen dieser Fixierungen sowie die Übertragung des Lizenzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleich ob in digitaler oder analoger Form. 
„Verbreiten“ bedeutet, den Lizenzgegenstand im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen. 
„Kommerziell“ bedeutet vorrangig vorgesehen für oder gerichtet auf einen geschäftlichen Vorteil oder eine geldwerte Vergütung. Der Austausch des Lizenzgegenstands gegen andere urheberrechtlich geschützte Werke oder Leistungen mittels digitalem File-Sharing gilt nicht als kommerziell, wenn in Verbindung mit dem Austausch des Lizenzgegenstandes tatsächlich keine Zahlung oder geldwerte Vergütung geleistet wird. „Nicht kommerziell“ hat eine dementsprechende Bedeutung. 
2. Schranken des Urheberrechts 
 
Dieser Lizenzvertrag lässt sämtliche Befugnisse unberührt, die sich aufgrund der Beschränkungen der ausschliesslichen Rechte des Rechteinhabers durch das Urheberrechtsgesetz (Eigengebrauch, Erschöpfungsgrundsatz etc.) oder durch andere Bestimmungen der anwendbaren Gesetzgebung ergeben. 
 
3. Lizenzierung 
 
Unter den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber die Befugnis ein, den Lizenzgegenstand weltweit, lizenzgebührenfrei, nicht exklusiv und zeitlich unbeschränkt (d.h. für die Schutzdauer des Werks oder des verwandten Schutzrechts) wie folgt zu nutzen: 
 
den Lizenzgegenstand zu vervielfältigen, ihn in eine oder mehrere Sammlungen aufzunehmen und ihn im Rahmen der Sammlung zu vervielfältigen; 
den Lizenzgegenstand oder Vervielfältigungen davon zu verbreiten, öffentlich wiederzugeben, durch Radio, Fernsehen oder ähnliche Einrichtungen, auch über Leitungen, zu senden, weiterzusenden oder sonstwie wahrnehmbar zu machen, wobei sich diese Befugnisse auch auf den in eine Sammlung aufgenommenen Lizenzgegenstand erstrecken. 
Die vorstehend genannten Befugnisse können für alle Nutzungsarten sowie in jedem Medium und Format ausgeübt werden, ob diese bereits bekannt sind oder erst in Zukunft entwickelt werden. Diese Befugnisse umfassen auch das Recht zu Änderungen, die technisch notwendig sind, um die Befugnisse in anderen Medien und Formaten auszuüben. Darüber hinaus dürfen jedoch keine Änderungen vorgenommen werden. 
 
4. Bedingungen 
 
Die in Ziffer 3 eingeräumten Befugnisse unterliegen den folgenden Bedingungen: 
 
Bei jeder Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz müssen Sie eine Kopie dieser Lizenz mitgeben. Sie können hiervon absehen, wenn Sie an Stelle dieser Lizenz die jedermann zugängliche Fundstelle dieser Lizenz bekannt geben (Uniform Resource Identifier, URI). Sie müssen bei der Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz alle Hinweise auf diese Lizenz und auf ihre Klauseln betreffend Gewährleistungs- und Haftungsausschluss beibehalten. Sie dürfen keine Vereinbarungen treffen, welche die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verschärfen oder die mit dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte für einen Dritten einschränken. Sie dürfen für den Lizenzgegenstand keine Unterlizenz erteilen. Sie dürfen den Lizenzgegenstand nicht mit technischen Schutzmassnahmen versehen, die den Nutzer des Lizenzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. 
 
Ziffer 4 Buchstabe a gilt auch, falls der Lizenzgegenstand Bestandteil einer Sammlung ist. Dies bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass die Sammlung als solche diesen Lizenzbestimmungen unterstellt werden muss. 
 
Wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand in eine Sammlung aufnehmen, müssen Sie auf Aufforderung des Urhebers oder jedes Lizenzgebers hin jeden Hinweis auf den Auffordernden soweit machbar und gewünscht aus der Sammlung entfernen; soweit Hinweise gestützt auf eine solche Aufforderung zu entfernen sind, entfallen die Pflichten gemäss Ziffer 4 Buchstabe c. 
Sie dürfen die in Ziffer 3 genannten Befugnisse nicht zu kommerziellen Zwecken ausüben. 
Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstands, sei es isoliert oder als Teil einer Sammlung, müssen Sie die bestehenden Copyright-Vermerke vollständig beibehalten bzw. in einem Rahmen wiedergeben, der dem technischen Verfahren und dem Trägermedium der von Ihnen vorgenommenen Nutzung angemessen ist, ausgenommen, es liegt eine Aufforderung zur Entfernung der Angaben gemäss Ziffer 4 Buchstabe a Absatz 3 vor. 
Insbesondere müssen Sie (i) den Namen (oder das Pseudonym) des Urhebers sowie den Namen von Dritten nennen, die ein Rechteinhaber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen hat. 
Ist Ihnen (ii) der Titel des Lizenzgegenstands bekannt, müssen Sie diesen angeben. 
Hat der Lizenzgeber (iii) eine Internetadresse angegeben (z.B. in Form des Uniform Resource Identifier, URI), welche Lizenzinformationen oder Copyright-Vermerke enthält, müssen Sie diese ebenfalls nennen, soweit dies mit angemessenem Aufwand durchführbar ist. 
Die gemäss dieser Ziffer 4 Buchstabe c vorgeschriebenen Hinweise können in jeder angemessenen Weise erfolgen. Bei Sammlungen müssen solche Hinweise hinsichtlich Plazierung und Ausgestaltung mindestens ebenso auffällig und in vergleichbarer Weise ausgeführt werden, wie dies für die anderen Rechteinhaber erfolgte, sofern ein solcher Hinweis für alle beitragenden Lizenzgeber erscheint. 
 
Zur Klarstellung: Die gemäss dieser Ziffer 4 Buchstabe c vorgeschriebenen Hinweise dürfen ausschliesslich in der in diesem Abschnitt beschriebenen Weise und zum Zweck der Zurechnung des Werks zum Urheber, Lizenzgeber bzw. zu Dritten, die ein Urheber bzw. Lizenzgeber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen hat, verwendet werden. Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes dürfen Sie weder implizit noch explizit den Eindruck einer Unterstützung oder Billigung durch diese Personen oder den Eindruck einer sonstigen Verbindung zwischen Ihnen und diesen Personen erwecken, ohne zuvor eine separate schriftliche Einwilligung von den betroffenen Personen eingeholt zu haben. 
Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes: 
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche als Gegenleistung für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschliessliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie. 
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen ausserhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschliessliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen, verzichtet für alle übrigen, lizenzgerechten Fälle von Nutzung jedoch auf jegliche Vergütung. 
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch das ausschliessliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung (durch ihn selbst oder eine Verwertungsgesellschaft) für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen. 
Ihre Befugnis, den Lizenzgegenstand zu nutzen, findet ihre gesetzliche Grenze in den (Urheber-) Persönlichkeitsrechten des Rechteinhabers, dessen berechtigte geistige und persönliche Interessen bzw. dessen Ansehen oder Ruf durch die Nutzung ohne eine zuvor eingeholte separate schriftliche Einwilligung der betroffenen Personen nicht beeinträchtigt werden dürfen. 
5. Keine Gewährleistung 
 
SOFERN VOM LIZENZGEBER NICHT SCHRIFTLICH ANDERS ANERKANNT, ÜBERNIMMT DER LIZENZGEBER KEINE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG FÜR DIE ERTEILTEN BEFUGNISSE. 
 
6. Haftungsausschluss 
 
ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER 5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER NUR FÜR VORSATZ UND GROBE FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT. JEDE ANDERE HAFTUNG IST AUSGESCHLOSSEN, SOWEIT GESETZLICH ZULÄSSIG. FÜR SEINE HILFSPERSONEN HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER IN KEINEM FALL. DIESER HAFTUNGSAUSSCHLUSS GILT AUCH DANN, WENN SIE AUF DIE MÖGLICHKEIT EINER SCHÄDIGUNG HINGEWIESEN HABEN. 
 
7. Beendigung 
 
Diese Lizenz und die darunter eingeräumten Befugnisse fallen ohne weiteres und mit sofortiger Wirkung dahin, wenn Sie die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verletzen. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die den Lizenzgegenstand enthaltende Sammlungen unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 und 8 bleiben ungeachtet der Beendigung dieser Lizenz verbindlich. 
Die mit dieser Lizenz eingeräumten Befugnisse werden zeitlich uneingeschränkt eingeräumt (freilich höchstens für die Dauer, für welche der Lizenzgegenstand nach dem anwendbaren Recht urheber- bzw. leistungsschutzrechtlich geschützt ist). Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch für einen beliebigen Zeitpunkt das Recht vor, den Lizenzgegenstand unter einer anderen Lizenz weiterzugeben oder die Verbreitung des Lizenzgegenstands ganz zu beenden. Der Lizenzwechsel wird jedoch nicht die Wirkung eines Widerrufs dieser Lizenz haben (oder jeder anderen Lizenzierung, die auf der Grundlage dieser Lizenz erfolgt oder erfolgen muss), vielmehr wird die Lizenz so lange weiter bestehen, als sie nicht nach Ziffer 7 Buchstabe a vorstehend beendigt wurde. 
8. Verschiedenes 
 
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand oder eine Sammlung gestützt auf Ziffer 3 dieser Lizenz nutzen, räumt der Lizenzgeber auch dem Empfänger eines allfälligen Vervielfältigungsstücks eine Lizenz am Lizenzgegenstand selber ein, und zwar zu denselben Bedingungen wie die Ihnen eingeräumte Lizenz. 
Sollten sich einzelne Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz nach dem anwendbaren Recht als nicht durchsetzbar oder nichtig erweisen, so bleiben die übrigen Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz gültig und durchsetzbar und an die Stelle der unwirksamen Bestimmung tritt eine Ersatzregelung, die dem mit der unwirksamen Bestimmung angestrebten Zweck am nächsten kommt. 
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz gilt als wegbedungen und keine Verletzung als genehmigt, bevor nicht die durch die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung belastete Partei die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung in Schriftform und unterschriftlich bestätigt hat. 
Diese Lizenz enthält alle mit Blick auf den Lizenzgegenstand zwischen den Parteien massgeblichen Bestimmungen. Andere Vertrauenspositionen, Abreden oder Zusicherungen im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand bestehen nicht. Der Lizenzgeber ist durch keine zusätzliche Klausel gebunden, welche sich aus irgendwelchen Unterlagen von Ihnen ergibt. Diese Vereinbarung kann ohne vorherige Vereinbarung mit unterschriftlicher Bestätigung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen nicht abgeändert werden. 
Creative Commons Hinweis 
 
Creative Commons ist nicht Partei dieses Lizenzvertrags und macht keinerlei Zusicherungen mit Blick auf den Lizenzgegenstand. Creative Commons haftet nicht für Ihnen entstandene Schäden aus der Verwendung des Lizenzgegenstands oder dieser Lizenz, aus welchem Rechtsgrund sie auch abgeleitet werden, sei es für direkten, indirekten Schaden oder für Folgeschaden. Ungeachtet des vorstehenden Satzes hat Creative Commons alle Rechte aus dieser Lizenz, sofern sie bezüglich eines Werks ausdrücklich selber als Lizenzgeberin unter dieser Lizenz auftritt. 
 
Ausser für den begrenzten Zweck, dem Publikum öffentlich bekannt zu machen, dass der Lizenzgegenstand unter der CCPL lizenziert ist, erlaubt Creative Commons den Parteien dieser Lizenz nicht, das Markenzeichen "Creative Commons" oder irgend ein anderes Markenzeichen oder Logo von Creative Commons ohne die vorgängige schriftliche Zustimmung von Creative Commons zu verwenden. Jegliche erlaubte Nutzung hat in Übereinstimmung mit den dannzumal gültigen Markenrichtlinien von Creative Commons zu stehen. Die Markenrichtlinien von Creative Commons sind auf ihrer Website abrufbar oder erhältlich auf Anfrage.

Sollten sich einzelne Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz nach dem anwendbaren Recht als nicht durchsetzbar oder nichtig erweisen, so bleiben die übrigen Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz gültig und durchsetzbar und an die Stelle der unwirksamen Bestimmung tritt eine Ersatzregelung, die dem mit der unwirksamen Bestimmung angestrebten Zweck am nächsten kommt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz gilt als wegbedungen und keine Verletzung als genehmigt, bevor nicht die durch die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung belastete Partei die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung in Schriftform und unterschriftlich bestätigt hat.

LA SOCIÉTÉ CREATIVE COMMONS N'EST PAS UNE ÉTUDE D'AVOCATS ET NE FOURNIT PAS DE CONSEILS OU DE SERVICES JURIDIQUES. LA DISTRIBUTION DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE NE CRÉE AUCUN MANDAT ENTRE SON UTILISATEUR ET CREATIVE COMMONS. CREATIVE COMMONS LIVRE CES INFORMATION « TEL QUEL » ET NE FOURNIT AUCUNE GARANTIE EN RELATION AVEC CETTE LICENCE ET LES INFORMATIONS QU’ELLE CONTIENT ET SE DÉCHARGE DE TOUTE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR TOUT DOMMAGE POUVANT RÉSULTER DE SON UTILISATION. CETTE LIMITATION DE RESPONSABILITÉ S’ÉTEND ÉGALEMENT AUX PERSONNES QUI ONT PARTICIPÉ À L’ADAPTATION DE LA LICENCE AU DROIT SUISSE.
Licence
En exerçant l’un des droits concernés par cette licence, Vous acceptez que les termes de la présente licence soient juridiquement contraignantes. Pour autant que la présente licence puisse être considérée comme un contrat, le donneur de licence Vous autorise à utiliser sans contrepartie les droits figurant dans cette licence à condition que vous acceptiez de Vous conformer strictement à ses termes.
Le « Donneur de licence », à savoir la personne qui met l’Objet de la Licence à disposition aux conditions qu’elle contient,  et  « Vous », à savoir la personne physique ou morale, qui utilisez, au sens de l’article 3 de la présente Licence, l’Objet de la Licence conformément aux termes de la présente Licence acceptez, sous réserve d’une autorisation expresse du Donneur de licence de Vous en écarter, de Vous conformer strictement aux conditions d’utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence contenues dans la présente Licence indépendamment de toute utilisation contraire qui aurait pu en être faite par le passé :
1. Définitions
L’ « Objet de la licence » peut être une Œuvre protégée par le droit d’auteur ou une prestation protégée par des droits voisins.
Un « Recueil » au sens de la présente Licence est une compilation de l’Objet de la licence avec d'autres œuvres ou d'autres éléments, indépendamment du fait que le Recueil en tant que tel jouisse d’un droit d’auteur en raison du choix ou de la disposition de son contenu. Par « Recueil », il faut entendre les bases de données, indépendamment du fait qu’elles jouissent d’un droit d’auteur en raison du choix ou de la disposition de leur contenu. Le fait d’incorporer l’Objet de la licence dans un Recueil n’équivaut pas à une Modification de l'Objet de licence.
Une « Modification » au sens de la présente Licence signifie tout changement de l’Objet de la licence, en particulier, toute transformation, œuvre dérivée, modification, adaptation ou traduction, aussi longtemps que le caractère unique de l’Objet de licence demeure reconnaissable. Le fait d’incorporer l’Object de la licence dans un Recueil n’équivaut pas à une Modification.
« Titulaire des droits » comprend l'auteur de l’Objet de la licence, les titulaires de droits voisins, ou toute autre personne ayant acquis des droits en relation avec l’Objet de la licence et qui est autorisée à accorder des licences ou sous-licences à des tiers.
Une « Œuvre » est une création de l’esprit, littéraire ou artistique, qui a un caractère individuel.
Un « Droit voisin » est un droit relatif à une prestation culturelle, qui n'est pas protégé en tant qu'Œuvre, tels que ceux des artistes interprètes, producteurs de phonogrammes et de vidéogrammes et des organismes de radiodiffusion.
« Représentation publique » est la représentation, la récitation, la projection ou la mise à disposition de l’Objet de la licence directement ou par tout autre moyen permettant aux personnes présentes en un lieu et à un moment donné d’y avoir accès.
« Reproduire » signifie une reproduction de l’Objet de la licence en utilisant n'importe quel moyen de reproduction temporaire ou permanent, y compris l'exploitation de la première fixation physique de l'Objet de la licence et la production de copies de cette fixation ainsi que le transfert de l’Objet de la licence sur tout support visuel ou sonore ou tout autre support électronique, que ce soit sous forme numérique ou analogique.
« Diffuser » signifie mettre à disposition du public ou mettre en circulation l’Objet de la licence ou des Modifications sous forme originale ou sous forme de reproductions physiques.
« Commercial » signifie principalement conçu ou dirigé vers un avantage commercial ou une compensation financière. L’échange de l’Objet de la Licence avec d’autres Œuvres protégées par le droit d’auteur ou d’autres prestations par le biais de partage de fichiers numériques (« File-sharing ») n’est pas considéré comme commercial, lorsqu’aucun paiement ou compensation financière n’est payé en relation avec l’échange de l’Objet de la Licence. « Non-commercial » a une signification équivalente.
2. Restrictions du droit d’auteur
La présente Licence n’a pas pour effet de limiter les droits découlant des restrictions au droit d'auteur (utilisation à des fins privées, principe de l'épuisement, etc.) ou d'autres lois applicables.
3. Licences
En vertu des termes de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence Vous accorde le droit non exclusif d’utiliser l’Objet de la licence dans le monde entier, libre de redevance, pour une durée indéterminée (pour la durée de la protection de l’Œuvre par le droit d’auteur ou les droits voisins) comme suit :
Reproduire l’Objet de la Licence, l’incorporer dans un Recueil et le reproduire une fois incorporé dans le Recueil.
Diffuser ou rendre accessible au public l’Objet de la licence ou des copies de celui-ci, que ce soit par le biais de la radio, la télévision ou de toute installation similaire, y compris par le câble, permettant de le diffuser, de le rediffuser ou de le rendre perceptible de toute autre manière, étant précisé que ces prérogatives s'étendent aux Recueils lorsque l’Objet de la licence y est incorporé.
Les prérogatives figurant ci-dessus valent pour tous types d'utilisation et tous types de médias ou de formats connus ou futurs. Ces prérogatives comprennent le droit d'apporter des modifications qui sont techniquement nécessaires pour pouvoir les exercer sur d’autres supports ou dans d’autres formats. Au-delà de ça, toute Modification de l’Objet de la Licence est exclue.
4. Conditions
Les autorisations accordées au chiffre 3 ci-dessus sont soumises aux conditions suivantes :
Pour chaque exercice d’un droit conféré par cette Licence, Vous devez remettre une copie de cette Licence. Vous pouvez y renoncer si Vous la rendez accessible à quiconque sous la forme d’un « Uniform Resource Identifier » (ci-après : « URI »). Lorsque Vous exercez un droit en vertu de la présente Licence, Vous devez maintenir toutes les références à cette Licence et aux clauses d’exclusion de garantie et de responsabilité. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à conclure un accord qui durcirait les conditions de la présente Licence ou qui soumettrait les droits garantis par cette Licence à des restrictions vis-à-vis des tiers. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à accorder des sous-licences en relation avec l’Objet de la Licence. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à soumettre l’Objet de la Licence à des mesures de protection techniques qui empêcheraient ses utilisateurs d’exercer les droits garantis par la présente Licence.  La présente disposition (article 4 let. a) s’applique également dans les cas où l’Objet de la Licence est incorporé à un Recueil, indépendamment du fait que ledit Recueil soit en tant que tel soumis aux conditions de la présente Licence.  Lorsque Vous incorporez l’Objet de la Licence dans un Recueil, Vous devez, à la requête du Titulaire des droits ou de tout Donneur de licence et dans la mesure du possible, retirer du Recueil toute référence au requérant ; dès lors que les références sont retirées sur la base d’une telle requête, les obligations de l’article 4 let. c sont applicables.
Vous n’êtes pas en droit d’exercer les droits qui Vous sont accordés en vertu de l’article 3 à des fins commerciales.
Pour chaque diffusion, mise à disposition du public de l’Objet de la Licence, que ce soit de manière individuelle ou dans le cadre d’un Recueil, Vous devez, à moins qu’une requête au sens de l’article 4 let. a ne Vous ait été adressée, faire en sorte que toutes les mentions légales relatives au droit d’auteur en relation avec l’Objet de la Licence demeurent intactes et faire en sorte, dans les limites des moyens techniques et des supports que Vous utilisez, que les indications suivantes figurent dans la mention légale relative au droit d’auteur :
Nom de l’auteur original (ou, le cas échéant, son pseudonyme) ou le nom de tiers figurant dans la mention légale initiale ;
Le titre de l’Œuvre, pour autant qu’il Vous soit connu ;
L’adresse internet (par exemple sous la forme d’Uniform Resource Identifier, URI) qui contient les informations relatives à la Licence ou la mention légale relative au droit d’auteur pour autant que cela puisse raisonnablement être mis en œuvre ;
Les mentions légales requises par l’article 4 let. c peuvent être indiquées de toute manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas de Recueils, s’il figure une mention légale pour tous les auteurs ayant contribué au Recueil, alors la mention légale pour chacun des auteurs doit être au minimum d’une importance comparable à celle des autres auteurs ayant participé au Recueil.  Pour clarification : les mentions légales requises par cet article 4 let. c ne peuvent être utilisées que pour attribuer la paternité de l’Œuvre conformément aux obligations contenues dans la présente Licence, et, en exerçant Vos droits dans le cadre de la présente Licence, Vous n’êtes pas autorisé à prétendre de manière directe ou indirecte ou à laisser penser qu’il existe un parrainage entre Vous et l’auteur original, le Donneur de licence et/ou les auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre avec Vous ou que l’auteur original, le Donneur de licence et/ou les auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre avec Vous approuvent votre travail ou l’utilisation que Vous faites de l’Œuvre sans autorisation séparée, expresse et préalable de l’auteur original, du Donneur de licence ou des auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre.
La rémunération pour l'utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence est soumise aux principes suivants :
Système de rémunération légale obligatoire : dans les cas où il existe un système de rémunération légale obligatoire en échange de licences légales ou un système de redevance forfaitaire (par exemple, pour les supports vierges), le Donneur de licence se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances pour chacune des utilisations que Vous faites d’un droit faisant l’objet de cette Licence ;
Système de rémunération lié à l’octroi de licences obligatoires : dans les cas où des licences obligatoires n’étant pas comprises dans cette Licence entrent en considération, le Donneur de licence se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter les redevances correspondantes dans les cas où Vous faites une utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence qui contrevient aux fins non commerciales définies à l’article 4 let. b mais renonce à toute rémunération pour toute utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence que Vous seriez amené à faire en vertu d’une licence obligatoire ;
Autres cas de rémunération : le Donneur de licence renonce à toute rémunération pour toute utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence conformément aux termes de celle-ci et qui ne tombe pas sous le coup des deux sections précédentes (i) et (ii), indépendamment du fait que la collecte des droits d’auteur puisse se faire par le Donneur de licence lui-même ou doive impérativement passer par une société de gestion. Le Donneur de Licence se réserve toutefois le droit exclusif de collecter les redevances (seul ou par le biais d’une société de gestion) dans les cas où Vous faites une utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence qui contrevient aux fins non commerciales définies à l’article 4 let. b.
Votre possibilité d’utiliser l’Objet de la Licence trouve ses limites dans les droits de la personnalité et les droits moraux du Titulaire des droits, lequel a le droit à ce que son intégrité intellectuelle et personnelle, ainsi que son honneur et sa réputation ne soient pas atteints sans une autorisation écrite préalable séparée.
5. Exclusion de garantie
A MOINS D’UN ENGAGEMENT ÉCRIT CONTRAIRE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE DONNE AUCUNE GARANTIE EN RELATION AVEC LES PRÉROGATIVES ACCORDÉES EN VERTU DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE.
6. Limitation de responsabilité
LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE RÉPOND QUE DES DOMMAGES INTENTIONNELS OU RÉSULTANT DE SA NÉGLIGENCE GRAVE EN RELATION AVEC LES GARANTIES DONNÉES EN VERTU DE L’ARTICLE 5. TOUTE AUTRE RESPONSABILITÉ DU DONNEUR DE LICENCE EST EXCLUE, POUR AUTANT QUE CELA SOIT LICITE. LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE RÉPOND EN AUCUN CAS DE SES AUXILIAIRES. LA PRÉSENTE EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ EST ÉGALEMENT APPLICABLE DANS LES CAS OÙ VOUS AURIEZ ÉTÉ AVISÉ DE LA POSSIBILITÉ D’UN DÉDOMMAGEMENT.
7. Résiliation
Cette Licence - et les droits qu’elle contient – prendra fin automatiquement et avec effet immédiat en cas de violation de l’un de ses termes. Les personnes physiques et morales qui ont reçu des Recueils de votre part sur la base de cette Licence pourront néanmoins continuer à les utiliser sur la base de leurs licences, pour autant, toutefois, que ces personnes physiques ou morales se conforment strictement aux termes de ces licences. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 resteront en vigueur en cas de résiliation de cette Licence.
Les droits accordés par la présente Licence sont accordés pour une durée indéterminée (pour la durée de protection de l’Objet de la Licence en vertu du droit applicable en matière de droit d’auteur ou de droits voisins) aux conditions contenues dans la présente Licence. Nonobstant ce qui précède, le droit du Donneur de licence de publier l’Œuvre sous d’autres termes contractuels ou d’arrêter de diffuser l’Œuvre à tout moment est réservé, à condition, toutefois, que cette décision n’ait pas pour effet d’annuler la présente Licence (ou toute licence qui a été, ou qui doit être accordée sur la base de cette Licence), étant précisé que dans ce cas de figure la présente Licence restera en vigueur jusqu’à sa résiliation conformément à ce qui précède.
8. Divers
Chaque fois que Vous utilisez l’Objet de la Licence ou un Recueil conformément à l’article 3 de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence accorde au destinataire de l’Objet de la Licence ou du Recueil une licence semblable à celle-ci, aux mêmes conditions, valant pour l’utilisation de l’Œuvre.
Dans l’hypothèse où une disposition contenue dans la présente Licence devait être considérée comme nulle ou ne pourrait être exécutée en vertu du droit applicable, les autres dispositions de la présente Licence demeureraient pleinement valables et exécutoires et la disposition inefficace devrait être remplacée par une disposition conforme au but recherché par la présente Licence.
Aucune renonciation des termes ou dispositions de la présente Licence ne pourra être acceptée et aucune violation ne pourra être consentie sans l’accord écrit et signé par la partie concernée par cette renonciation ou ce consentement.
La présente Licence constitue le seul accord entre les parties à propos de l’Objet de la Licence. Il n'existe aucun accord ou garantie portant sur l’Objet de la Licence en dehors des éléments mentionnés ici. Le Donneur de licence ne sera tenu par aucune disposition complémentaire qui pourrait figurer dans une communication de Votre part. Cette Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord mutuel écrit des Parties.
Note Creative Commons

Creative Commons ne peut être tenue responsable envers Vous ou toute partie sur la base d’aucune théorie juridique pour tout dommage, que ce soit pour des dommages directs, des indirects ou consécutifs survenus en relation avec cette Licence. Nonobstant les deux (2) phrases précédentes, si Creative Commons a expressément reconnu agir comme Donneur de Licence, elle répondra vis-à-vis de Vous de la même manière que le Donneur de Licence.
Creative Commons n’autorise aucune partie à utiliser la marque « Creative Commons » ou toute autre marque ou logo de Creative Commons sans l'accord préalable écrit de Creative Commons, sauf pour indiquer au public que l’Œuvre est mise à disposition sous licence CCPL.

Nada en esta Licencia podrá ser interpretado como una disminución, limitación o restricción de cualquiera de los derechos de usos que se encuentran permitidos por las leyes, tal como las excepciones y limitaciones a los derechos de autor y conexos previstos en la ley u otras legislaciones que resulten aplicables.
3. Otorgamiento de la Licencia.

El intercambio de la Obra por otras obras protegidas por derechos de autor, ya sea a través de un sistema para compartir archivos digitales (digital file-sharing) o de cualquier otra manera no será considerado como destinado principalmente o dirigido directamente a conseguir un provecho comercial o una compensación monetaria privada, siempre que no se realice pago de una compensación monetaria cualquiera en relación con el intercambio de obras protegidas por derechos de autor.

Los créditos o menciones solicitados por esta Sección 4(c) pueden ser implementados de cualquier forma razonable; Sin embargo, si en una Colección aparecen mencionados los autores que contribuyeron a formarla, como mínimo el crédito de esta Sección 4(c) deberá aparecer incluido como parte de dicha mención y de forma tan destacada como los créditos de quienes han contribuido. Para evitar dudas, Usted sólo puede utilizar los créditos requeridos por esta Sección con la finalidad de realizar la atribución de paternidad o autoría en la forma señalada anteriormente y, para ejercer sus derechos bajo esta Licencia, Usted no puede implícita ni explícitamente afirmar ni sugerir ninguna conexión, patrocinio o respaldo por parte del Autor Original, del Licenciante y/o de los Grupos de Atribución, según corresponda, de Usted o del uso que ha hecho de la Obra, sin la autorización separada, previa y escrita del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Grupo de Atribución.

7. Término
Esta Licencia y los derechos otorgados en virtud de ella terminarán automáticamente si Usted infringe alguna condición establecida en ella.

Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, y 8 subsistirán a cualquier terminación de esta Licencia.
Sujeta a las condiciones y términos anteriores, la licencia otorgada aquí es permanente (durante el período de vigencia de los derechos de autor de la obra). No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho a publicar y/o estrenar la Obra bajo condiciones de licencia diferentes o a dejar de distribuirla en los términos de esta Licencia en cualquier momento; sin embargo, cualquiera sea la elección, ella no surtirá efecto retroactivo respecto de la Licencia de este ejemplar de la obra (o cualquier otra Licencia que haya sido otorgada, o le haya sido exigida, bajo los términos de ésta).

“知识共享”（Creative Commons）不是一家律师事务所也不对外提供法律服务。提供本许可协议文本并不导致“律师—当事人”关系的建立。“知识共享”按其现状（As Is）提供这些信息。“知识共享”对于所提供的信息不提供任何担保，也不对因使用该信息而造成的损失承担损害赔偿责任。
协议文本
本作品（定义如下）的提供是以适用“知识共享公共许可协议”（ 简称“CCPL”或 “许可”）为前提的。本作品受《中华人民共和国著作权法》以及其他可适用法律的保护。对本作品的使用不得超越本许可协议授权的范围。
如您行使本许可授予的使用本作品的权利，就表明您接受并同意遵守本许可协议的所有条款。鉴于本许可为合同，在您接受这些条款和规定的前提下，许可人授予您本许可所包括的权利。
第一条 定义
本作品：指根据本许可协议提供的以任何方式和形式（包括以数字形式）表达之文学、艺术和科学领域的作品，例如：书籍、手册等文字作品；讲课、演讲、讲道及其他同类性质的作品；戏剧或音乐戏剧作品；曲艺作品；舞蹈作品及哑剧作品；配词或不配词的音乐作品；电影作品和以类似摄制电影的方法创作的作品；素描、绘画、书法、建筑、雕塑、雕刻或版画等作品；摄影作品以及以类似摄影的方法创作的作品；杂技艺术作品；实用艺术作品；与地理、地形、建筑或科学有关的插图、地图、设计图、草图及立体的造型作品；以及法律、行政法规规定的其他文学艺术作品。为本许可协议之目的，本协议有关“本作品”的规定适用于表演、录音制品及广播电视节目。
原始作者：就文学或艺术作品而言，指创作本作品的自然人或依法视为本作品作者的法人或其他组织。为本许可之目的，下述情形下的自然人、法人或其他组织适用本许可有关“原始作者”的规定：（1）就表演而言，指演员、歌唱家、音乐家、舞蹈家和其他表演、演唱、演说、朗诵、演奏、表现或者以其它方式表演文学、艺术作品或民间文学艺术的人员；（2）就录音制品而言，指首次将表演的声音或其他声音录制下来的自然人、法人或其他组织；（3）就广播电视节目而言，指传播广播电视节目的组织；（4）作者身份不明的，指行使作品著作权（除署名权外）的作品原件所有人（比如出版社）。
演绎作品：指基于本作品，或基于本作品与其他已存在的作品而创作的作品，例如翻译、改编、编曲或对文学、艺术和科学作品的其他变更，包括以摄制电影的方法对作品的改编，或其他任何对本作品进行改造、转换、或改编后的形式，包含任何可确认为源自原始作品的修改形式。在本许可定义之下构成汇编作品的作品不视为演绎作品。为避免疑义，并为本许可之目的，当演绎对象为音乐作品时，将其依时间序列关系与动态影像配合一致而形成的结果，视为演绎作品。
汇编作品：指由于对内容的选择和编排具有独创性而构成智力创作的文学、艺术或科学作品的集合，其中本作品以完整且未经修改的形式和另外一部或多部作品组成集合的整体，而各组成作品本身是分开且独立的，例如百科全书、文选、数据汇编作品，以及本条第1项所列作品之外的作品或者标的。在本许可定义之下构成汇编作品的作品不视为演绎作品（定义如上）。
许可人：指根据本许可提供本作品的自然人、法人或者其他组织。

第二条 合理使用
本许可无意削减、限制或约束您基于《中华人民共和国著作权法》或其他相关法律有关著作权保护的限制或例外的规定对本作品的合理使用。
第三条 授权
根据本许可的条款和条件，许可人在此授予您全球性、免版税、非独占并且在本作品的著作权存续期间内均有效的许可，就本作品行使以下权利：
复制本作品或将本作品收入一个或多个汇编作品中，以及复制汇编作品中收录的本作品；
发行、公开传播本作品（包括汇编作品中收录的本作品）。
以上权利可在任何现有的或者以后出现的并为可适用的法律认可的媒体和形式上行使。上述权利包括为在其他媒体和形式上行使权利而必须进行技术性修改的权利，但除此之外，您不得对本作品进行任何修改。许可人在此保留所有未明示授予的权利，包括但不限于第四条第4项所规定的权利。
第四条 限制
第三条的授权须受以下规定的限制：
您在发行或公开传播本作品时，必须遵守本许可协议。在您发行或公开传播的本作品的每一份复制件中，您必须附上一份本许可协议的复制件或本许可协议的网址（Uniform Resource Identifier）。您不得就本作品提出或增加任何条款，从而限制本许可协议或者限制获得本作品的第三方行使本许可协议所赋予的权利。您不得对本作品进行再许可。您必须在您发行或公开传播的每份作品复制件中完整保留所有与本许可协议及免责条款相关的声明。 在发行或公开传播本作品时，您不得对本作品施加任何技术措施，从而限制从您处获得本作品的第三方行使本许可协议授予的权利。本项（第四条第1项）规定同样适用于收录在汇编作品中的本作品，但并不要求汇编作品中除本作品外的其他作品受本许可协议的约束。在创作汇编作品时，若接到任一许可人的通知，您必须按照其要求，在可行范围内删除汇编作品中根据本协议第四条第3项的要求所作的有关原始作者的身份及其他有关原始作品相关信息的标注。 
您不得以任何形式行使本协议第三条授予您的权利去谋取或获得商业利益或私人金钱报酬。若交换过程中未涉及任何商业利益或私人金钱报酬，通过数字文件共享方式或其他方式用本作品去交换其他受著作权保护的作品，将不被视为谋取或获得商业利益或私人金钱报酬。
在发行或公开传播本作品或任何汇编作品时，除非有依据第四条第1项之要求，否则您必须完整保留所有关于本作品的著作权声明，并以适于所使用的媒介或方法的形式提供下述信息：（1）在原始作者的姓名（或笔名）已被提供的情况下，给出该姓名或笔名，或者在原始作者或许可人以许可人的著作权声明或其他合理的方式，指定可以在作品上署名的他方当事人姓名的情况下，指明该他方当事人的名称（“署名人”）；（2）在本作品标题已被提供的情况下，给出本作品的标题；（3）在合理可行的范围内，标明许可人指定需与本作品同时出现的网址，除非该网址没有涉及到本作品的著作权声明或者关于本作品的许可信息。本项（第四条第3项）要求的对作者姓名和作品名称的指明可采取任何合理方式，但在汇编作品中，如果已经指明了汇编作品中所有内含作品的作者，那么对本作品名称和作者姓名的指明须同时出现在任何其他作者姓名出现的地方，并至少与对其他作者的指明一样显著。为避免疑义，本条有关标示作者姓名和作品名称之规定，仅适用于前述署名的用途；除非您事先另行取得原始作者、许可人或署名人的书面同意，否则您不得以明示或者默示的方式主张或暗示，您本人或您对作品的使用与原始作者、许可人或署名人有关联或者已获得上述人士的赞助或者支持。
为避免疑义，针对不同司法管辖区的著作权许可体系作出如下约定：
权利不能放弃的强制许可体系。  在那些许可人不能放弃通过任何法定的或强制的许可方案收取许可使用费的权利的司法管辖区，许可人保留因您行使本许可协议授予的权利而向您收取许可使用费的专有权；
权利可以放弃的强制许可体系。  在那些许可人可以放弃通过任何法定的或强制的许可方案收取许可使用费的权利的司法管辖区，许可人放弃因您行使本许可协议授予的权利而向您收取许可使用费的专有权；但若您行使本许可协议授予的权利时未遵守本许可协议第四条第2项有关非商业性使用的规定，则许可人保留向您收取本作品许可使用费的权利；
自愿许可体系。  在实行著作权自愿许可的司法管辖区，若您行使本许可协议授予的权利时未遵守本许可协议第四条第2项有关非商业性使用的规定，则许可人保留向您收取本作品许可使用费的权利，许可人可以自行或者通过所参加的著作权集体管理组织向您收取本作品的许可使用费。
除非其他法律法规另有规定，您在复制、发行或者公开表演本作品，或者复制、发行或者公开表演作为任何汇编作品一部分的本作品时，不得歪曲、损害或者以其他方式损害本作品，导致原始作者的名誉或者荣誉受损。
第五条 声明、保证和免责
除非本许可的当事人相互以书面的方式做出相反约定，且在相关法律所允许的最大范围内，否则许可人按其现状提供本作品，对本作品不作任何明示或者默示、依照法律或者其他规定的陈述或担保，包括但是不限于任何有关可否商业性使用、是否符合特定的目的、不具有潜在的或者其他缺陷、准确性或者不存在不论能否被发现的错误的担保。有些司法管辖区不允许排除前述默示保证，因此这些排除性规定并不一定适用于您。
第六条 责任限制
除非属于相关法律所要求的范围，许可人在任何情况下都不对您因本许可或因使用本作品而产生的任何直接损失、间接损失或惩罚性赔偿负责，即使许可人已被告知发生此类损害的可能性。
第七条 许可终止
在您违反本许可协议任何条款时，本许可及其所授予的权利将自动终止。然而，根据本许可从您处获取汇编作品的自然人、法人或者其他组织，如果他们仍完全遵守相关条款，则对他们的许可不会随之终止。即使本许可被终止，第一条、第二条、第五条、第六条、第七条以及第八条仍然有效。
在上述条款及条件的前提下，此处授予的许可在法定著作权保护期限内有效。即便如此，许可人保留依其他许可条款发行本作品及在任何时候停止发行本作品的权利；但是，许可人的上述权利不能被用于撤销本许可或任何其他在本许可条款下授予的或必须授予的许可，除本条第1项指明的终止外，本许可将保持其完全效力。
第八条 其他事项
当您发行、公开传播本作品或其汇编作品时，许可人给获得作品的第三方提供本作品的许可，其条款和条件与您所获得的许可相同。
如因相关法律，本许可的某一条款无效或不能履行，本许可其余条款的有效性和可履行性不受影响。如本许可的当事人未采取进一步措施，此类无效条款应在必要范围内进行最低限度的修改以使其有效和可履行。
除非当事人书面同意并签字放弃某条款和允许某违约行为，本许可的任何条款或规定都不应被视为已被放弃，或被视为允许此违约行为。
本许可构成相关当事人与本授权作品相关的全部协议。除已在此处确认的之外，并不存在任何与本作品相关的谅解备忘录、协议或声明。许可人不受您提出的任何附加规定的约束。未经许可人和您双方书面同意，本许可不得更改。
“知识共享”（Creative Commons）声明
“知识共享”不是本许可协议的一方，对本作品不作任何相关保证。“知识共享”不对您或任何其他方的任何损失负责，包括但不限于与本许可相关的直接损失和间接损失。虽然有上述两点，但如果“知识共享”已明确标识自己为许可人，它将承担许可人的全部权利和义务。
除用于向公众表明本作品是依照知识共享公共许可协议（CCPL）授权以外，如未经“知识共享”事先书面同意，任何一方均不得使用“知识共享”（Creative Commons）商标和其他相关商标及标识。任何被允许的使用都必须符合“知识共享”的现行商标使用准则。该准则已在其网站上发布或可应要求随时提供。为避免疑义，本段关于商标的限制性规定不构成本许可之一部分。

1. Definitionen
Der Begriff "Abwandlung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes.
Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.
"Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt.
"Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist.

Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" im Sinne dieser Lizenz.
Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben.
Unter "Öffentlich Zeigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.
"Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form.
2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts
Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben.
3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten
Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 4.e) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ("unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann"):
Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;
den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten.
Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Weitergehende Änderungen oder Abwandlungen sind jedoch untersagt. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte.
4. Bedingungen
Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen.
Die Rechteeinräumung gemäß Abschnitt 3 gilt nur für Handlungen, die nicht vorrangig auf einen geschäftlichen Vorteil oder eine geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet sind ("nicht-kommerzielle Nutzung", "Non-commercial-Option"). Wird Ihnen in Zusammenhang mit dem Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz ein anderer Schutzgegenstand überlassen, ohne dass eine vertragliche Verpflichtung hierzu besteht (etwa im Wege von File-Sharing), so wird dies nicht als auf geschäftlichen Vorteil oder geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet angesehen, wenn in Verbindung mit dem Austausch der Schutzgegenstände tatsächlich keine Zahlung oder geldwerte Vergütung geleistet wird.
Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben:  
Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ("Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
den Titel des Inhaltes;
in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand.
Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten.
Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen.
Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen, verzichtet für alle übrigen, lizenzgerechten Fälle von Nutzung jedoch auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung (durch ihn selbst oder eine Verwertungsgesellschaft) für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen.
Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt.
5. Gewährleistung
SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT, SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT.
6. Haftungsbeschränkung
DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR, SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG.
7. Erlöschen
Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die den Schutzgegenstand enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort.
Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.
8. Sonstige Bestimmungen
Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat.
Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß Ziffern 8.a) angeboteten Lizenzen aus.
Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung.

Licencia
SE CONFIERE LA OBRA (TAL COMO SE DEFINE A CONTINUACIÓN) SEGÚN LAS CONDICIONES DE ESTA LICENCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS (“CCPL” O “LICENCIA”). LA OBRA ESTÁ PROTEGIDA POR LA LEGISLACIÓN VIGENTE EN MATERIA DE DERECHOS DE AUTOR Y DERECHOS CONEXOS EN EL ECUADOR, Y/U OTRAS LEYES APLICABLES. SE PROHÍBE TODO USO DE LA OBRA EXCEPTO EL AUTORIZADO SEGÚN ESTA LICENCIA O LAS LEYES ANTES MENCIONADAS.
AL EJERCER CUALQUIER DERECHO OTORGADO EN ESTA LICENCIA, EL LICENCIATARIO ACEPTA Y ACUERDA CUMPLIR LAS CONDICIONES DE LA MISMA. SI EN UNA INTERPRETACIÓN MÁS AMPLIA, ESTA LICENCIA PUDIERE CONSIDERARSE UN CONTRATO, EL LICENCIANTE LE OTORGA LOS DERECHOS EN ELLA CONTENIDOS TOMANDO EN CUENTA SU ACEPTACIÓN DE DICHOS TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES.
1. Definiciones
“Obra Derivada” Obras que revistan características de originalidad tales como: traducciones, resúmenes y extractos; arreglos musicales y las demás transformaciones de una obra literaria o artística; grabaciones o ejecuciones e incluye adaptaciones cinematográficas o cualquier otra forma en que la Obra pueda ser retransmitida, transformada o adaptada incluyendo cualquier forma reconociblemente derivada del original, excepto las Obras que forman parte de una Colección, las mismas que no serán consideradas Obras Derivadas para los propósitos de esta Licencia. Para evitar cualquier duda, en los casos en los cuales la Obra sea una obra musical, ejecución o grabación musical, la sincronización de la obra de una forma cronometrada con una imagen en movimiento (“sincronización”) será considerada una Obra Derivada para los propósitos de esta Licencia.
“Colección” Es el conjunto de cosas por lo común de una misma clase o género, el conjunto de obras literarias o artísticas, tales como enciclopedias y antologías, o ejecuciones, grabaciones o transmisiones, u otras obras excepto las enumeradas en la Sección 1(f) siguiente, que, debido a la selección y al arreglo de sus contenidos, sean consideradas creaciones intelectuales, en las cuales la Obra se incluye en su extensión completa en formato no modificado, junto con una o más contribuciones adicionales de otros tipos, y cada una de las cuales sea considerada una Obra por separado e independiente por sí sola, y que en su conjunto se consideren como una Colección. Un trabajo que constituye una Colección no será considerada una Obra Derivada (tal como se define anteriormente) para los propósitos de esta Licencia.
“Distribución” Poner a disposición del público, el original o copias de la Obra, mediante su venta, arrendamiento, préstamo público o de cualquier otra forma conocida o por conocerse de transferencia de la propiedad, posesión o tenencia de dicho original o copia.
“Licenciante” Significa el individuo, los individuos, la entidad o las entidades, titular o titulares de los Derechos de Autor, que ofrecen la Obra según las estipulaciones de esta Licencia.
“Autor” Es la persona natural que realiza la creación intelectual. Para los efectos de esta Licencia el Autor también debe entenderse como el artista, intérprete o ejecutante; el productor de un fonograma y el titular de radiodifusión en el sentido de los Derechos Conexos.
“Obra”Es toda creación intelectual original, de naturaleza artística, científica, o literaria, susceptible de ser divulgada o reproducida en cualquier forma conocida o por conocerse. Para los efectos de esta Licencia “Obra” también debe entenderse como una interpretación o ejecución, una emisión, un fonograma en el sentido de los Derechos Conexos de acuerdo con la Ley de Derechos de Autor, en la medida en que la interpretación o ejecución, la emisión o el fonograma estén protegidos por la ley aplicable.
“Licenciatario” Persona natural o jurídica que ejerce sus derechos según esta Licencia y que no ha infringido previamente las condiciones de la misma con respecto a la Obra. O quien ha recibido un permiso expreso por parte del Licenciante para ejercer sus derechos según esta Licencia, a pesar de dicho incumplimiento previo.
“Ejecución Pública” Son las exhibiciones públicas de la Obra o comunicación al público de aquellos relatos públicos, por cualquier medio o proceso, incluyendo la ejecución digital pública o por medios conectados o inalámbricos; es poner a disposición del público las obras de tal forma que los miembros del público puedan acceder a estas obras desde un sitio y en un sitio que personalmente hayan seleccionado; es ejecutar la Obra ante el público por cualquier medio o proceso y la comunicación al público de dichas ejecuciones de la Obra, incluyendo la ejecución digital pública; difundir y volver a difundir la Obra por cualquier medio, sea señales, sonidos, imágenes u otro medio de difusión.
“Reproducción” Es la fijación de la Obra en cualquier medio o por cualquier procedimiento, conocido o por conocerse, incluyendo su almacenamiento digital, temporal o definitivo, y la obtención de copias de toda o parte de ella por cualquier medio incluyendo, entre otros, grabaciones de audio o visuales y el derecho de grabar y de reproducir grabaciones de la Obra, incluso el almacenamiento de una grabación protegida o de una grabación en formato digital u otro medio electrónico.
2. Usos Honrados.- Ninguna estipulación contenida en esta Licencia podrá ser interpretada como una disminución, limitación o restricción de los derechos derivados del uso honrado y otras limitaciones o excepciones a los Derechos de Autor bajo el régimen legal vigente o derivado de cualquier otra norma aplicable.
3. Concesión de la Licencia.- Sujeto a los términos y a las condiciones de esta Licencia, el Licenciante otorga al Licenciatario una Licencia mundial, sin cobro de regalías, no exclusiva e indefinida (depende del acuerdo de los contratantes de la Licencia), para ejercer los derechos de Licenciatario de la Obra, tal como se estipulan a continuación:
Reproducir la Obra, e incorporarla en una o más Colecciones, y a reproducir la Obra tal como se incorpora en las Colecciones; y,
Distribuir y ejecutar públicamente la Obra incluyendo aquella cuando se incorpora en Colecciones.
Se podrán ejercer dichos derechos en todos los formatos y medios, sean conocidos ahora o se conozcan en el futuro. Los derechos anteriores incluyen el derecho a realizar dichas modificaciones que sean técnicamente necesarias para ejercer los derechos en otros medios y formatos, pero a parte de eso, el Licenciatario no tiene derecho a hacer Obras Derivadas. Todos los derechos no cedidos expresamente por el Licenciante quedan reservados, incluyendo, pero sin limitarse a los establecidos en la sección 4(d).
4. Restricciones.- La Licencia otorgada en la Sección 3 se sujeta expresamente y se limita según las siguientes restricciones:
El Licenciatario podrá distribuir o ejecutar públicamente la Obra solamente según las condiciones de esta Licencia. Deberá incluir una copia del Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI, por su sigla en inglés) para esta Licencia con cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente. El Licenciatario no podrá ofrecer ni imponer ninguna condición en la Obra que pueda restringir los términos de esta Licencia ni la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra para ejercer los derechos otorgados según las condiciones de esta Licencia. No podrá otorgar sub-licencias de la Obra. Deberá mantener sin modificaciones todas las notificaciones que se refieren a esta Licencia y a los descargos de responsabilidades con cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente. Cuando el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra, el Licenciatario no podrá imponer ninguna medida tecnológica vigente en la Obra que pueda restringir la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra por parte del Licenciatario para ejercer los derechos otorgados al receptor, según las condiciones de esta Licencia. Se aplica esta Sección 4(a) a la Obra tal como se incorpora en una Colección, pero para esto no hace falta que la Colección, aparte de la Obra en sí, esté sujeta a las condiciones de esta Licencia. Si el Licenciatario es Autor de una Colección, cuando reciba la notificación de cualquier Licenciante, el Licenciatario debe; en la medida en que sea práctico, retirar de la Colección cualquier crédito tal como se requiere de acuerdo con la Sección 4(c), según se solicite.
El Licenciatario no podrá ejercer ningún derecho otorgado a Él en la Sección 3 en ninguna forma cuya intención principal u objetivo sea la ventaja comercial ni la compensación monetaria privada. No se considerará que el intercambio de la Obra por cualquier otra Obra con Derechos de Autor al compartir archivos digitales tenga la intención ni el objetivo de la ventaja comercial ni la compensación monetaria privada, siempre y cuando no haya ninguna compensación monetaria en relación con el intercambio de la Obra protegidas por el Derechos de Autor.
Si el Licenciatario distribuye o ejecuta públicamente la Obra o Colección, el Licenciatario debe, excepto si se ha presentado una solicitud según la Sección 4(a), mantener intactas todas las notificaciones de Derechos de Autor de la Obra e incluir, de forma razonable, dependiendo del medio o forma que el Licenciatario está usando: (i) el nombre del Autor (o seudónimo, si fuera aplicable) si fuera suministrado el nombre de dicha parte o partes, y/o si el Autor y/o el Licenciante designaran cualquier otra parte o partes (por ejemplo, un instituto auspiciante, una entidad de publicación, una revista) para el reconocimiento (las “Partes del Reconocimiento”) en la notificación de Derechos de Autor o condiciones del servicio del Licenciante o por otros medios razonables; (ii) el título de la Obra si fuera suministrado; (iii) en la medida en que fuera práctico, el Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI), si lo hubiere, que el Licenciante especifique que está asociado con la Obra; excepto si dicho URI no se refiere a la notificación del Derecho de Autor ni a la información de Licencias para la Obra. Se podrá implementar el crédito requerido por esta Sección 4(c) en cualquier forma razonable; siempre y cuando, en el caso de una Colección, por lo menos, aparecerá dicho crédito, si aparece un crédito de todos los autores que contribuyeron en la Colección, como una parte de estos créditos y de una forma, por lo menos, tan destacada como los créditos de los demás autores que contribuyeron. Para evitar toda duda, el Licenciatario solamente podrá usar el crédito requerido por esta Sección con el propósito de reconocimiento en la manera anteriormente descrita y, al ejercer sus derechos según esta Licencia, el Licenciatario no podrá implícita ni tácitamente aseverar ni dar a entender ninguna conexión, auspicio ni respaldo por parte del Autor, Licenciante ni Partes del Reconocimiento, según corresponda, otorgado al Licenciatario o a su uso de la Obra, sin el permiso independiente, expreso, previo y escrito del Autor, el Licenciante y/o las Partes del Reconocimiento.
Para evitar todas las dudas, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho de recaudar regalías, sea individualmente o en el caso en que el Licenciante sea miembro de una sociedad de recaudaciones que maneje esquemas de licencias voluntarias, mediante dicha sociedad, cuando el Licenciatario ejerza cualquier derecho otorgado según esta Licencia.
Los derechos concedidos en la sección 3 se deben ejercer teniendo en cuenta los Derechos Morales del Autor para objetar cualquier alteración, mutilación o deformación u otra acción despectiva en relación al trabajo, que pudiera resultar perjudicial para el honor o reputación del Autor o de su dignidad como tal en la medida que el Autor no puede renunciar a los Derechos Morales bajo las disposiciones legales aplicables.
5. Declaraciones, Exoneración de Garantía y Responsabilidad
SALVO PACTO EN CONTRARIO DE AMBAS PARTES, QUE CONSTE POR ESCRITO, Y EN LA MAYOR EXTENSIÓN DE LO PERMITIDO POR LAS LEYES VIGENTES, EL LICENCIANTE OFRECE LA OBRA EN SUS CONDICIONES ACTUALES. EL AUTOR GARANTIZA LA AUTORÍA Y ORIGINALIDAD DE LA OBRA, SIN EMBARGO NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA SOBRE LA CALIDAD COMERCIAL DE LA OBRA O SU ADECUACIÓN PARA UN PROPÓSITO EN PARTICULAR.
6. Limitación de Responsabilidad.
SALVO QUE LA LEY APLICABLE LO EXIJA EXPRESAMENTE, EL LICENCIANTE EN NINGÚN CASO PODRÁ SER RESPONSABLE ANTE EL LICENCIATARIO POR NINGÚN DAÑO ESPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RESULTANTE, PUNITIVO NI EJEMPLAR QUE SURGIERA POR ESTA LICENCIA NI POR EL USO DE LA OBRA.
7. Terminación
Esta Licencia y los derechos otorgados por esta Licencia terminarán automáticamente si el Licenciatario incumpliera cualquiera de las condiciones de esta Licencia. Sin embargo, si hay individuos o entidades que hayan recibido colecciones de parte del Licenciatario bajo esta Licencia, sus Licencias no terminarán, siempre y cuando dichos individuos o entidades cumplan por completo las condiciones de esas Licencias. Las Secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 se mantendrán ante cualquier terminación de esta Licencia.
Sujeto a las condiciones y términos antes mencionados, la Licencia otorgada aquí se concede por el tiempo que dura la protección de los Derechos de Autor de la Obra. No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho de emitir o publicar esta Obra bajo los términos de Licencias diferentes o a dejar de distribuir la Obra en cualquier momento; siempre y cuando dicha opción no cumpla el propósito de revocar esta Licencia (o cualquier otra Licencia adicional que haya sido, o que deba, ser otorgada según las condiciones de esta Licencia) y la misma continuará en plena vigencia y efecto, excepto si terminare según las estipulaciones previas.
8. Asuntos diversos
Cada vez que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra o una Colección, el Licenciante ofrecerá al receptor una Licencia para la Obra en las mismas condiciones y términos que la Licencia otorgada al Licenciatario según esta Licencia.
Si cualquier estipulación de esta Licencia no fuera válida ni exigible según las leyes aplicables, este hecho no afectará la validez o exigibilidad del resto de condiciones de esta Licencia, y sin que se requiera ninguna acción adicional de las partes de este acuerdo, se cambiará dicha estipulación en lo estrictamente necesario para que dicha estipulación sea válida y exigible.
No se considerará que se ha renunciado a ninguna estipulación ni condición de esta Licencia ni se considerará que se ha aceptado ningún incumplimiento excepto si dicha renuncia o consentimiento fueran por escrito y en éste constare la firma de las partes.
Esta Licencia constituye el acuerdo completo entre las partes con respecto a la Obra, cuya Licencia se otorga mediante este documento. No hay acuerdos, puntos de compromiso ni declaraciones con respecto a la Obra que no estén estipulados en el presente. El Licenciante no tendrá la obligación de cumplir ninguna estipulación adicional que podrá incluirse en cualquier comunicación enviada por el Licenciatario. No se podrá modificar esta Licencia sin el consentimiento escrito del Licenciante y del Licenciatario.
Notificación de Creative Commons
Creative Commons no es parte interesada de esta Licencia y no presenta ninguna garantía de ningún tipo en relación con la Obra. Creative Commons no es responsable ante el Licenciatario ni ante terceros por ninguna teoría legal de ningún daño de ningún tipo, incluyendo, entre otros, cualquier daño general, especial, incidental ni resultante que surgiera en relación con esta Licencia. Sin perjuicio de lo mencionado en las líneas precedentes, si Creative Commons se ha identificado expresamente como el Licenciante según este documento, Creative Commons tendrá todos los derechos y obligaciones del Licenciante.
Excepto para cumplir el propósito limitado de indicar al público que la Obra cuenta con la Licencia según el CCPL, Creative Commons no autoriza el uso por ninguna de las partes de la marca registrada “Creative Commons” ni de ninguna marca registrada ni logotipo relacionados con Creative Commons, sin el consentimiento previo y por escrito de Creative Commons. Cualquier uso permitido deberá cumplir con las pautas de uso de marca registrada vigentes en ese momento de Creative Commons, según se pueda publicar en su sitio Web o que pudiera estar disponible de alguna otra forma y de tiempo en tiempo.

L'EXERCICI DE QUALSEVOL DRET SOBRE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ COMPORTA QUE ACCEPTEU LES LIMITACIONS I OBLIGACIONS D'AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA I HI CONSENTIU, SENSE PERJUDICI DE LA NECESSITAT DE CONSENTIMENT EXPRÉS EN CAS DE VIOLACIÓ PRÈVIA DE LES SEVES CONDICIONS. EL LLICENCIADOR US CONCEDEIX ELS DRETS CONTINGUTS EN AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA, SEMPRE QUE N'ACCEPTEU LES CONDICIONS QUE HI SÓN PRESENTS. 
1. Definicions 
L'obra és la creació literària, artística o científica oferta en els termes d'aquesta llicència. 
En aquesta llicència es considera una prestació qualsevol interpretació, execució, fonograma, enregistrament audiovisual, emissió o transmissió, mera fotografia o qualsevol altre objecte protegit per la legislació de propietat intel·lectual vigent aplicable. 
L'aplicació d'aquesta llicència a una col·lecció (definida més endavant) afectarà únicament l'estructura com a forma d'expressió de la selecció o disposició dels continguts, i no es farà extensiva a aquests. En aquest cas la col·lecció tindrà la consideració d'obra a efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
El titular originari és: 
En el cas d'una obra literària, artística o científica, la persona natural o el grup de persones que l'ha creada. 
En el cas d'una obra col·lectiva, la persona que l'editi i el divulgui amb el seu nom, llevat que hi hagi un pacte contrari. 
En el cas d'una interpretació o execució, l'actor, cantant, músic, o qualsevol altra persona que representi, canti, llegeixi, reciti, interpreti o executi de qualsevulla manera una obra. 
En el cas d'un fonograma, el productor fonogràfic, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica sota la iniciativa i responsabilitat de la qual es fa per primera vegada una fixació exclusivament sonora de l'execució d'una obra o d'altres sons. 
En el cas d'un enregistrament audiovisual, el productor de l'enregistrament, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica que tingui la iniciativa i assumeixi la responsabilitat de les fixacions d'un pla o una seqüència d'imatges, amb o sense so. 
En el cas d'una emissió o una transmissió, l'entitat de radiodifusió. 
En el cas d'una mera fotografia, aquella persona que l'hagi realitzada. 
En el cas d'altres objectes protegits per la legislació de la propietat intel·lectual vigent, la persona que aquesta indiqui. 
Es consideraran obres derivades aquelles obres creades a partir de l'objecte d'aquesta llicència com, per exemple, les traduccions i adaptacions; les revisions, actualitzacions i anotacions; els compendis, resums i extractes; els arranjaments musicals, i en general qualsevol transformació d'una obra literària, artística o científica. Per aclarir dubtes, si l'obra consisteix en una composició musical o en un enregistrament de sons, la sincronització temporal de l'obra amb una imatge en moviment (synching) serà considerada com una obra derivada als efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
Tindran la consideració de col·leccions la recopilació d'obres alienes, de dades o d'altres elements independents com ara les antologies i les bases de dades que per la selecció o disposició de llurs continguts constitueixin creacions intel·lectuals. La mera incorporació d'una obra en una col·lecció no donarà lloc a una obra derivada a efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
El llicenciador és la persona o l'entitat que ofereix l'obra o la prestació subjecta als termes d'aquesta llicència i que en concedeix els drets d'explotació conforme al que s'hi disposa. 
Vós sou la persona o l'entitat que exerceix els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència i que prèviament no ha violat els termes d'aquesta llicència respecte a l'obra o la prestació, o que ha rebut un permís exprés del llicenciador per exercir els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència malgrat una violació anterior. 
La transformació d'una obra comprèn la traducció, l'adaptació i qualsevol altra modificació de la qual derivi una obra diferent. La creació resultant de la transformació d'una obra tindrà la consideració d'obra derivada. 
S'entén per reproducció la fixació directa o indirecta, provisional o permanent, per qualsevol mitjà i en qualsevol forma, de tota l'obra o la prestació o de part d'ella, que en permeti la comunicació o l'obtenció de còpies. 
S'entén per distribució el fet de posar a disposició del públic l'original o les còpies de l'obra o la prestació mitjançant la venda, el lloguer, el préstec o qualsevol altre sistema. 
S'entén per comunicació pública qualsevol acte mitjançant el qual una pluralitat de persones, que no pertanyin a l'àmbit domèstic de qui la duu a terme, pot tenir accés a l'obra o la prestació sense que se'ls hagi fet una distribució prèvia d'exemplars. Es considera comunicació pública el fet de posar l'obra o la prestació a disposició del públic per procediments electrònics amb fil o sense fil de manera que qualsevol persona pugui accedir-hi des d'on vulgui i quan vulgui. 
L'explotació de l'obra o la prestació comprèn la reproducció, la distribució, la comunicació pública i, en el seu cas, la transformació. 
2. Límits dels drets. No hi ha res en aquesta llicència que pretengui reduir o restringir qualsevol dels límits legals dels drets exclusius del titular dels drets de propietat intel·lectual d'acord amb la Llei de propietat intel·lectual o qualsevol altra normativa aplicable, ja siguin drets derivats d'usos legítims —com ara la còpia privada o la citació— ja siguin altres limitacions —com la que resulta de la primera venda d'exemplars (exhauriment). 
3. Concessió de llicència. Conforme a les condicions d'aquesta llicència, el llicenciador concedeix, pel termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual i a títol gratuït, una llicència d'àmbit mundial no exclusiva que inclou els drets següents: 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació. 
Dret d'incorporar l'obra o la prestació en una o més col·leccions. 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació lícitament incorporada en una col·lecció. 
Dret d'extraure i reutilitzar l'obra o la prestació d'una base de dades. 
Aquests drets es poden exercir en tots els mitjans i formats, tangibles o intangibles, coneguts en el moment de concessió d'aquesta llicència. Els drets esmentats inclouen el dret a efectuar les modificacions que siguin tècnicament necessàries per exercir els drets en altres mitjans i formats. Tots aquells drets no concedits expressament pel llicenciador queden reservats, incloent-hi, a títol enunciatiu però no limitatiu, els establerts en la secció 4.e, així com els drets morals irrenunciables reconeguts per la llei aplicable. En la mesura que el llicenciador tingui drets exclusius previstos per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea en matèria de dret sui generis sobre bases de dades, renuncia expressament a aquests drets exclusius. 
4. Restriccions. La concessió de drets que implica aquesta llicència està subjecta i limitada a les restriccions següents: 
Podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació només en els termes d'aquesta llicència i n'heu d'incloure una còpia, o l'identificador uniforme de recursos (URI) corresponent. No podeu oferir o imposar cap condició sobre l'obra o la prestació que alteri o restringeixi els termes d'aquesta llicència o l'exercici dels drets per part dels seus concessionaris. No podeu subllicenciar l'obra o la prestació. Heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos referents a aquesta llicència i a l'absència de garanties. No podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació amb mesures tecnològiques que en controlin l'accés o l'ús d'una manera contrària als termes d'aquesta llicència. Aquesta secció 4.a també afecta l'obra o la prestació incorporada en una col·lecció, però no implica que la col·lecció en conjunt automàticament quedi o hagi de quedar subjecta als mateixos termes. En el cas que us sigui requerit, mitjançant una comunicació prèvia del llicenciador, si incorporeu l'obra o la prestació en una col·lecció, haureu d'eliminar qualsevol dels crèdits requerits en l'apartat 4.c, fins on sigui possible. 
No podeu exercir cap dels drets concedits en l'anterior secció 3 si el que es pretén principalment o la vostra actuació està dirigida a l'obtenció d'un benefici mercantil o una contraprestació monetària. L'intercanvi de l'obra o la prestació per altres obres o prestacions protegides per la propietat intel·lectual mitjançant sistemes de compartir fitxers no es considerarà un procediment amb el qual es pretengui principalment o estigui dirigit a l'obtenció d'un benefici mercantil o una contraprestació monetària, sempre que no hi hagi cap pagament en relació amb l'intercanvi de les obres protegides. 
Si reproduïu, distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament l'obra o la prestació o una col·lecció que la incorpori, heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos sobre la propietat intel·lectual i indicar, de manera raonable conforme al mitjà o als mitjans que useu: 
El nom de l'autor original, o el pseudònim si és el cas, així com el del titular originari, si s'ha facilitat. 
El nom d'aquelles parts (per exemple: institució, publicació, revista) que el titular originari o el llicenciador designin perquè siguin reconegudes en l'avís legal, les condicions d'ús, o de qualsevol altra manera raonable. 
El títol de l'obra o la prestació si s'ha facilitat. 
L'URI, si n'hi ha, que el llicenciador especifiqui perquè sigui vinculat a l'obra o la prestació, llevat que aquest URI no es refereixi a l'avís legal o a la informació sobre la llicència de l'obra o la prestació. 
Aquest reconeixement s'ha de fer de manera raonable. En el cas d'una incorporació en una col·lecció, aquests crèdits hauran d'aparèixer com a mínim en el mateix lloc on hi hagi els corresponents a altres autors o titulars i de forma comparable a aquests. Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, els crèdits requerits en aquesta secció només s'usaran a efectes d'atribució de l'obra o la prestació en la manera especificada anteriorment. Sense un permís previ per escrit, no podeu afirmar ni fer entendre implícitament ni explícitament cap connexió, patrocini o aprovació per part del titular originari, el llicenciador o les parts reconegudes cap a vós o cap l'ús que feu de l'obra o la prestació. 
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, s'ha de fer notar que les restriccions anteriors (paràgrafs 4.a, 4.b i 4.c) no s'aplicaran a les parts de l'obra o la prestació subjecta a aquesta llicència que únicament puguin ser protegides mitjançant el dret sui generis sobre bases de dades recollit per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea de bases de dades. 
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, el titular originari conserva: 
El dret de percebre les remuneracions o compensacions previstes por actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació, qualificades per la llei com a irrenunciables i inalienables i subjectes a gestió col·lectiva obligatòria. 
El dret exclusiu de percebre, tant individualment com mitjançant una entitat de gestió col·lectiva de drets, qualsevol remuneració derivada d'actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació que feu que no quedin subjectes a aquesta llicència d'acord amb el que estableix l'apartat 4.b. 
5. Exoneració de responsabilitat 
LLEVAT QUE S'ACORDI MÚTUAMENT ENTRE LES PARTS, EL LLICENCIADOR OFEREIX L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ TAL COM ÉS (ON AN AS-IS BASIS) I NO CONFEREIX GARANTIA DE CAP MENA RESPECTE DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ O LA PRESÈNCIA O L'ABSÈNCIA D'ERRORS QUE ES PUGUIN DETECTAR O NO. ALGUNES JURISDICCIONS NO PERMETEN L'EXCLUSIÓ D'AQUESTES GARANTIES, DE MANERA QUE AQUESTA EXCLUSIÓ POT NO SER APLICABLE EN EL VOSTRE CAS. 
6. Limitació de responsabilitat. LLEVAT QUE LA LLEI APLICABLE HO DISPOSI EXPRESSAMENT I IMPERATIVAMENT, EN CAP CAS EL LLICENCIADOR SERÀ RESPONSABLE DAVANT VOSTRE PER QUALSEVOL DANY QUE EN PUGUI RESULTAR, TANT SI ÉS GENERAL COM ESPECIAL (INCLOSOS EL DANY EMERGENT I EL LUCRE CESSANT), FORTUÏT O CAUSAL, DIRECTE O INDIRECTE, PRODUÏT PER L'ÚS DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ DURANT EL PERÍODE EN QUÈ S'ESTÉN AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA, ENCARA QUE EL LLICENCIADOR HAGUÉS ESTAT INFORMAT DE LA POSSIBILITAT D'AQUESTS DANYS. 
7. Finalització de la llicència 
Aquesta llicència i la concessió dels drets que conté acabaran automàticament en cas que se n'incompleixi qualsevol dels termes. No obstant això, no s'anul·larà la llicència d'aquelles persones o entitats que hagin rebut col·leccions vostres amb aquesta llicència, sempre que aquestes persones o entitats es mantinguin en el compliment íntegre d'aquesta llicència. Les seccions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, i 8 continuaran vigents malgrat que finalitzi aquesta llicència. 
Conforme a les condicions anteriors, la concessió de drets d'aquesta llicència és vigent per tot el termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual segons la llei aplicable. Malgrat això, el llicenciador es reserva el dret a divulgar o publicar l'obra o la prestació en condicions diferents a les presents, o a retirar-la en qualsevol moment. Tanmateix, això no suposarà donar per conclosa aquesta llicència (o qualsevol altra llicència que hagi estat concedida, o calgui concedir, en els termes d'aquesta llicència), sinó que continuarà vigent i amb efectes complets, a menys que no hagi finalitzat conforme allò establert anteriorment, sense perjudici del dret moral de penediment en els termes reconeguts per la llei de propietat intel·lectual aplicable. 
8. Miscel·lània 
Cada vegada que exploteu d'alguna manera l'obra o la prestació, o una col·lecció que la incorpori, el llicenciador ofereix als tercers i successius llicenciataris la concessió de drets sobre l'obra o la prestació, en les mateixes condicions que la llicència que us ha estat concedida. 
Si alguna disposició d'aquesta llicència resulta invàlida o inaplicable segons la llei vigent, això no afectarà la validesa o l'aplicabilitat de la resta dels termes d'aquesta llicència i, sense cap acció addicional per a qualsevol de les parts d'aquest acord, aquesta disposició s'entendrà reformada en allò estrictament necessari per fer que aquesta disposició sigui vàlida i executiva. 
No s'entendrà que hi ha renúncia pel que fa a algun terme o disposició d'aquesta llicència, ni que se'n consent cap violació, llevat que la renúncia o el consentiment figuri per escrit i estigui firmat per la part que renuncia o que consent. 
Aquesta llicència constitueix l'acord ple entre les parts respecte de l'obra o la prestació objecte d'aquesta llicència. No hi ha interpretacions, acords o condicions respecte de l'obra o la prestació que no s'especifiquin expressament en aquesta llicència. El llicenciador no estarà obligat per cap disposició complementària que pugui aparèixer en qualsevol comunicació vostra. Aquesta llicència no es pot modificar sense que ho acordeu per escrit amb el llicenciador. 
Avís de Creative Commons 
Creative Commons no és part d'aquesta llicència, i no ofereix cap garantia en relació amb l'obra o la prestació. Creative Commons no serà responsable davant vostre —o davant cap part—, ni per cap dany de cap tipus, tant si és general o especial (incloent-hi el dany emergent i el lucre cessant), com si és fortuït o causal, que estigui relacionat amb aquesta llicència. A pesar de les dues (2) afirmacions anteriors, si Creative Commons s'identifica expressament com a llicenciador, tindrà tots els drets i les obligacions del llicenciador. 
Llevat del propòsit limitat d'indicar al públic que l'obra o la prestació està subjecta a una llicència CCPL, cap part usarà la marca registrada Creative Commons ni cap altra marca registrada o insígnia relacionada amb Creative Commons sense el seu consentiment per escrit. Qualsevol ús permès es farà conforme a les pautes vigents en cada moment sobre l'ús de la marca registrada per Creative Commons, publicades en el seu web o proporcionades amb petició prèvia. Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, les restriccions en l'ús de la marca no formen part d'aquesta llicència.

Licencia 
LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN (SEGÚN SE DEFINEN MÁS ADELANTE) SE PROPORCIONA BAJO LOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTA LICENCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS (CCPL O LICENCIA). LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN SE ENCUENTRA PROTEGIDA POR LA LEY ESPAÑOLA DE PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL Y/O CUALESQUIERA OTRAS NORMAS QUE RESULTEN DE APLICACIÓN. QUEDA PROHIBIDO CUALQUIER USO DE LA OBRA O PRESTACIÓN DIFERENTE A LO AUTORIZADO BAJO ESTA LICENCIA O LO DISPUESTO EN LA LEY DE PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL. 
MEDIANTE EL EJERCICIO DE CUALQUIER DERECHO SOBRE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN, USTED ACEPTA Y CONSIENTE LAS LIMITACIONES Y OBLIGACIONES DE ESTA LICENCIA, SIN PERJUICIO DE LA NECESIDAD DE CONSENTIMIENTO EXPRESO EN CASO DE VIOLACIÓN PREVIA DE LOS TÉRMINOS DE LA MISMA.

1. Definiciones 
La obra es la creación literaria, artística o científica ofrecida bajo los términos de esta licencia. 
En esta licencia se considera una prestación cualquier interpretación, ejecución, fonograma, grabación audiovisual, emisión o transmisión, mera fotografía u otros objetos protegidos por la legislación de propiedad intelectual vigente aplicable. 
La aplicación de esta licencia a una colección (definida más adelante) afectará únicamente a su estructura en cuanto forma de expresión de la selección o disposición de sus contenidos, no siendo extensiva a éstos. En este caso la colección tendrá la consideración de obra a efectos de esta licencia. 
El titular originario es: 
En el caso de una obra literaria, artística o científica, la persona natural o grupo de personas que creó la obra. 
En el caso de una obra colectiva, la persona que la edite y divulgue bajo su nombre, salvo pacto contrario. 
En el caso de una interpretación o ejecución, el actor, cantante, músico, o cualquier otra persona que represente, cante, lea, recite, interprete o ejecute en cualquier forma una obra. 
En el caso de un fonograma, el productor fonográfico, es decir, la persona natural o jurídica bajo cuya iniciativa y responsabilidad se realiza por primera vez una fijación exclusivamente sonora de la ejecución de una obra o de otros sonidos. 
En el caso de una grabación audiovisual, el productor de la grabación, es decir, la persona natural o jurídica que tenga la iniciativa y asuma la responsabilidad de las fijaciones de un plano o secuencia de imágenes, con o sin sonido. 
En el caso de una emisión o una transmisión, la entidad de radiodifusión. 
En el caso de una mera fotografía, aquella persona que la haya realizado. 
En el caso de otros objetos protegidos por la legislación de propiedad intelectual vigente, la persona que ésta señale. 
Se considerarán obras derivadas aquellas obras creadas a partir de la licenciada, como por ejemplo: las traducciones y adaptaciones; las revisiones, actualizaciones y anotaciones; los compendios, resúmenes y extractos; los arreglos musicales y, en general, cualesquiera transformaciones de una obra literaria, artística o científica. Para evitar la duda, si la obra consiste en una composición musical o grabación de sonidos, la sincronización temporal de la obra con una imagen en movimiento (synching) será considerada como una obra derivada a efectos de esta licencia. 
Tendrán la consideración de colecciones la recopilación de obras ajenas, de datos o de otros elementos independientes como las antologías y las bases de datos que por la selección o disposición de sus contenidos constituyan creaciones intelectuales. La mera incorporación de una obra en una colección no dará lugar a una derivada a efectos de esta licencia. 
El licenciador es la persona o la entidad que ofrece la obra o prestación bajo los términos de esta licencia y le concede los derechos de explotación de la misma conforme a lo dispuesto en ella. 
Usted es la persona o la entidad que ejercita los derechos concedidos mediante esta licencia y que no ha violado previamente los términos de la misma con respecto a la obra o la prestación, o que ha recibido el permiso expreso del licenciador de ejercitar los derechos concedidos mediante esta licencia a pesar de una violación anterior. 
La transformación de una obra comprende su traducción, adaptación y cualquier otra modificación en su forma de la que se derive una obra diferente. La creación resultante de la transformación de una obra tendrá la consideración de obra derivada. 
Se entiende por reproducción la fijación directa o indirecta, provisional o permanente, por cualquier medio y en cualquier forma, de toda la obra o la prestación o de parte de ella, que permita su comunicación o la obtención de copias. 
Se entiende por distribución la puesta a disposición del público del original o de las copias de la obra o la prestación, en un soporte tangible, mediante su venta, alquiler, préstamo o de cualquier otra forma. 
Se entiende por comunicación pública todo acto por el cual una pluralidad de personas, que no pertenezcan al ámbito doméstico de quien la lleva a cabo, pueda tener acceso a la obra o la prestación sin previa distribución de ejemplares a cada una de ellas. Se considera comunicación pública la puesta a disposición del público de obras o prestaciones por procedimientos alámbricos o inalámbricos, de tal forma que cualquier persona pueda acceder a ellas desde el lugar y en el momento que elija. 
La explotación de la obra o la prestación comprende la reproducción, la distribución, la comunicación pública y, en su caso, la transformación. 
2. Límites de los derechos. Nada en esta licencia pretende reducir o restringir cualesquiera límites legales de los derechos exclusivos del titular de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de acuerdo con la Ley de propiedad intelectual o cualesquiera otras leyes aplicables, ya sean derivados de usos legítimos, tales como la copia privada o la cita, u otras limitaciones como la resultante de la primera venta de ejemplares (agotamiento). 
3. Concesión de licencia. Conforme a los términos y a las condiciones de esta licencia, el licenciador concede, por el plazo de protección de los derechos de propiedad intelectual y a título gratuito, una licencia de ámbito mundial no exclusiva que incluye los derechos siguientes: 
Derecho de reproducción, distribución y comunicación pública de la obra o la prestación. 
Derecho a incorporar la obra o la prestación en una o más colecciones. 
Derecho de reproducción, distribución y comunicación pública de la obra o la prestación lícitamente incorporada en una colección. 
Derecho a extraer y reutilizar la obra o la prestación de una base de datos. 
Estos derechos se pueden ejercitar en todos los medios y formatos, tangibles o intangibles, conocidos en el momento de la concesión de esta licencia. Los derechos mencionados incluyen el derecho a efectuar las modificaciones que sean precisas técnicamente para el ejercicio de los derechos en otros medios y formatos. Todos los derechos no concedidos expresamente por el licenciador quedan reservados, incluyendo, a título enunciativo pero no limitativo, los establecidos en la sección 4.e, así como los derechos morales irrenunciables reconocidos por la ley aplicable. En la medida en que el licenciador ostente derechos exclusivos previstos por la ley nacional vigente que implementa la directiva europea en materia de derecho sui generis sobre bases de datos, renuncia expresamente a dichos derechos exclusivos. 
4. Restricciones. La concesión de derechos que supone esta licencia se encuentra sujeta y limitada a las restricciones siguientes: 
Usted puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra o prestación solamente bajo los términos de esta licencia y debe incluir una copia de la misma, o su Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI). Usted no puede ofrecer o imponer ninguna condición sobre la obra o prestación que altere o restrinja los términos de esta licencia o el ejercicio de sus derechos por parte de los concesionarios de la misma. Usted no puede sublicenciar la obra o prestación. Usted debe mantener intactos todos los avisos que se refieran a esta licencia y a la ausencia de garantías. Usted no puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra o prestación con medidas tecnológicas que controlen el acceso o el uso de una manera contraria a los términos de esta licencia. Esta sección 4.a también afecta a la obra o prestación incorporada en una colección, pero ello no implica que ésta en su conjunto quede automáticamente o deba quedar sujeta a los términos de la misma. En el caso que le sea requerido, previa comunicación del licenciador, si usted incorpora la obra en una colección, deberá quitar cualquier crédito requerido en el apartado 4.c, en la medida de lo posible. 
Usted no puede ejercitar ninguno de los derechos concedidos en la sección 3 anterior de manera que pretenda principalmente o su actuación se dirija a la obtención de un beneficio mercantil o una contraprestación monetaria. El intercambio de la obra por otras obras protegidas por la propiedad intelectual mediante sistemas de compartir archivos no se considerará como una manera que pretenda principalmente o se encuentre dirigida hacia la obtención de un beneficio mercantil o una contraprestación monetaria, siempre que no haya ningún pago en relación con el intercambio de las obras protegidas. 
Si usted reproduce, distribuye o comunica públicamente la obra o la prestación, o una colección que la incorpore, debe mantener intactos todos los avisos sobre la propiedad intelectual e indicar, de manera razonable conforme al medio o a los medios que usted esté utilizando: 
El nombre del autor original, o el seudónimo si es el caso, así como el del titular originario, si le es facilitado. 
El nombre de aquellas partes (por ejemplo: institución, publicación, revista) que el titular originario y/o el licenciador designen para ser reconocidos en el aviso legal, las condiciones de uso, o de cualquier otra manera razonable. 
El título de la obra o la prestación si le es facilitado. 
El URI, si existe, que el licenciador especifique para ser vinculado a la obra o la prestación, a menos que tal URI no se refiera al aviso legal o a la información sobre la licencia de la obra o la prestación. 
Este reconocimiento debe hacerse de manera razonable. En el caso de incorporación en una colección estos créditos deberán aparecer como mínimo en el mismo lugar donde se hallen los correspondientes a otros autores o titulares y de forma comparable a los mismos. Para evitar la duda, los créditos requeridos en esta sección sólo serán utilizados a efectos de atribución de la obra o la prestación en la manera especificada anteriormente. Sin un permiso previo por escrito, usted no puede afirmar ni dar a entender implícitamente ni explícitamente ninguna conexión, patrocinio o aprobación por parte del titular originario, el licenciador y/o las partes reconocidas hacia usted o hacia el uso que hace de la obra o la prestación. 
Para evitar cualquier duda, debe hacerse notar que las restricciones anteriores (párrafos 4.a, 4.b y 4.c) no son de aplicación a aquellas partes de la obra o la prestación objeto de esta licencia que únicamente puedan ser protegidas mediante el derecho sui generis sobre bases de datos recogido por la ley nacional vigente implementando la directiva europea de bases de datos 
Para evitar cualquier duda, el titular originario conserva: 
El derecho a percibir las remuneraciones o compensaciones previstas por actos de explotación de la obra o prestación, calificadas por la ley como irrenunciables e inalienables y sujetas a gestión colectiva obligatoria. 
El derecho exclusivo a percibir, tanto individualmente como mediante una entidad de gestión colectiva de derechos, cualquier remuneración derivada de actos de explotación de la obra o prestación que usted realice que no queden sujetos a esta licencia de acuerdo con lo establecido en el apartado 4.b. 
5. Exoneración de responsabilidad 
A MENOS QUE SE ACUERDE MUTUAMENTE ENTRE LAS PARTES, EL LICENCIADOR OFRECE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN TAL CUAL (ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS) Y NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA DE CUALQUIER TIPO RESPECTO DE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN O DE LA PRESENCIA O AUSENCIA DE ERRORES QUE PUEDAN O NO SER DESCUBIERTOS. ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE TALES GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PUEDE NO SER DE APLICACIÓN A USTED. 
6. Limitación de responsabilidad. SALVO QUE LO DISPONGA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE LA LEY APLICABLE, EN NINGÚN CASO EL LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSABLE ANTE USTED POR CUALESQUIERA DAÑOS RESULTANTES, GENERALES O ESPECIALES (INCLUIDO EL DAÑO EMERGENTE Y EL LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUITOS O CAUSALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENCIA O EL USO DE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN, INCLUSO SI EL LICENCIADOR HUBIERA SIDO INFORMADO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE TALES DAÑOS. 
7. Finalización de la licencia 
Esta licencia y la concesión de los derechos que contiene terminarán automáticamente en caso de cualquier incumplimiento de los términos de la misma. Las personas o entidades que hayan recibido de usted colecciones bajo esta licencia, sin embargo, no verán sus licencias finalizadas, siempre que tales personas o entidades se mantengan en el cumplimiento íntegro de esta licencia. Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 permanecerán vigentes pese a cualquier finalización de esta licencia.

LANA EDO PRESTAZIOA ESPAINIAKO JABETZA INTELEKTUALAREN LEGEAREN ETA EZARGARRI DIREN GAINERAKO ARAUEN BABESEAN DAUDE. DEBEKATURIK DAGO LAN EDO PRESTAZIO HAU ERABILTZEA BAIMEN HONETAN ONETSITAKOAZ EDOTA JABETZA INTELEKTUALAREN LEGEETAN XEDATUTAKOAZ KANPOKO BESTE EZERTARAKO.
LANAREN EDO PRESTAZIORAREN GAINEKO EDOZEIN ESKUBIDE ERABILIZ GERO, BAIMEN HONEN MUGAK ETA BETEBEHARRAK ONARTZEN ETA BAIESTEN DITUZU, BAZTERREAN UTZI GABE BERARIAZKO BAIMENTZEA, BAIMENA ALDEZ AURRETIK URRATUZ GERO. BAIMENDUNAK BAIMEN HONEN MENDE DIREN ESKUBIDEAK LAGATZEN DIZKIZU, ZUK BALDINTZA ETA BETEBEHAR HAUEK ONARTZEN BADITUZU.
1. Definizioak
Lana da baimen honen baldintzapean eskaintzen den literatur, arte edo zientzia sorkaria.
Baimen honetan prestaziotzat jotzen da edozein interpretazio, joaldi, fonograma, ikus-entzunezko grabazio, emanaldi, transmisio, argazki edota jabetza intelektualaren legeak babestutako beste edozein objektu.
Baimen hau bilduma batean (aurrerago dago definizioa) ezartzean denean, edukien antolaera edo hautapena adierazteko eraren egiturari eragingo dio, baina ez die edukiei eragingo. Halakoetan, bilduma hartuko da lantzat baimen honen ondorioetarako.
Jatorrizko jabea da:
literatur, arte edo zientzia sorkarien kasuan, lana sortu zuen gizabanakoa edo pertsona multzoa.
lan kolektiboen kasuan, bere izenpean editatu eta hedatzen duen pertsona, besterik ituntzen ez bada.
interpretazio edo joaldi baten kasuan, antzezlaria, musikaria edo obra bat edozein eratan antzeztu, abestu, irakurri, interpretatu edo jotzen duen pertsona.
fonograma baten kasuan, ekoizle fonografikoa, hau da, lan baten edo era guztietako hotsen joaldi baten finkatze soilik soinuduna lehen aldiz egiteko ekimena eta erantzukizuna hartu duen pertsona natural edo juridikoa.
ikus-entzunezko grabazioen kasuan, grabazioaren ekoizlea, hau da, plano bat edo irudi sekuentzia bat, soinuaz edo soinurik gabe, finkatzeko ekimena eta erantzukizuna hartu duen pertsona natural edo juridikoa.
emanaldi edo transmisioen kasuan, irrati emailea.
argazki hutsen kasuan, egilea den pertsona.
jabetza intelektualaren legeak babestutako beste edozein objekturen kasuan, legeak xedatzen duen pertsona.
Lan eratorritzat joko dira lan baimendunetik abiatuta sortutakoak, besteak beste: itzulpenak eta egokitzapenak; berrikuspenak, eguneratzeak eta oharpenak; bildumak, laburpenak eta aterakinak; musika moldaketak eta, orobat, literatur, arte edo zientzia lan baten eraldaketa oro. Zalantzarik egon ez dadin, lana baldin bada musika konposizioa eta soinu grabaketa, lan hori mugimenduzko irudiekin denboraz sinkronizatzea lan eratorritzat joko da baimen honen ondorioetarako.
Bildumatzat hartuko dira besteren lanen bildumak, datuzkoak edo bestelako elementu lokabezkoak, hala nola antologiak edota datu baseak, edukien hautapenagatik edo antolaeragatik sorkari intelektualak baldin badira. Lan bat bilduma baten barruan sartze hutsak ez du lan eratorririk sortuko baimen honen.
Baimenduna da lana edo prestazioa baimen honen baldintzapean eskaintzen duen pertsona edo erakundea, eta ustiapen-eskubideak lagatzen dituena hemen xedatutakoaren arabera.
Zu zara baimen honen bitartez lagatako eskubideak erabiltzen dituen pertsona edo erakundea eta aurrez lanari edo prestazioari buruz baimenaren baldintzak urratu ez dituena, edota baimendunaren berariazko onespena jaso duena baimen honen bitartez lagatako eskubideak erabiltzeko, nahiz aurretik urraketa egina izan.
Lanaren eraldatzea da itzultzea, egokitzea edota forma beste edonola aldatzea, nondik sortzen baita beste lan berri bat. Lan baten eraldaketa bidez gauzatzen den sorkaria lan eratorritzat joko da.
Erreprodukziotzat hartuko da lana edo prestazioa hedatzeko edo kopiak egiteko aukera ematen duen euskarri batean zuzenean nahiz zeharka finkatzea, behin-behin-behinekoz edo betirako, edozein bitarteko edo formatan delarik ere.
Banaketatzat hartzen da jendearen eskura jartzea lanaren edo prestazioaren jatorrizkoa nahiz kopiak, euskarri ukigai batean, salmenta, alokatze, mailegu edo beste edozein bidez.
Jendaurreko hedapentzat hartuko dira lana edo prestazioa jendaurrean, hedapena egiten duen pertsonaren etxekoen aurrean ez bada erakusteko egintza guztiak, pertsona bakoitzari lanaren edo prestazioaren ale bana aurrez eman behar izanik gabe. Jendaurreko hedapentzat joko da lana edo prestazioa jendearen eskura ipintzea bitarteko haridun nahiz hari gabekoen bidez, eta horren barnean izango da lana jendearen esku jartzea, jendeak nahi duen lekutik eta nahi duenean eskuratzeko moduan.
Lana edo prestazioa ustiatzea da erreproduzitzea, banatzea, jendaurrean hedatzea eta eraldatzea.
2. Eskubideen mugak. Baimen honetan ez dira ezertan mugatu edo gutxitu nahi jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen jabeak, Jabetza Intelektualaren Legearen arabera edota aplikagarri den beste edozein legeren arabera, bereak baino ez dituen eskubideen legezko mugak, berdin dio muga horiek erabilera zilegien ondorio izan, adibidez kopia pribatuaren eskubidearena edo aipamen eskubidearena, edo bestelako mugakizunen ondorio izan, hala nola aleen lehen salmentarena (agortzea).
3. Baimen ematea. Baimen honetan adierazten diren betebehar eta baldintzen arabera, baimendunak mundu osoaren esparruko baimen ez esklusiboa ematen du, jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen indarraldi osorako eta trukean ordainsari gabe, eskubide hauen lagapena eginez:
Lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzeko eskubidea.
Lana edo prestazioa bilduma batean nahiz gehiagotan txertatzeko eskubidea.
Baimen batean legez txertatutako lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzeko eskubidea.
Lana edo prestazioa datu base batetik erauzi eta berrerabitzeki eskubidea
Adierazitako eskubide horiek bitarteko eta formatu guztien bidez erabil daitezke, ukigarriak nahiz ukiezinak izan, baimen hau ematerakoan ezagun direnen arabera. Aipatutako eskubide horien barruan dago behar diren aldaketa teknikoak egiteko eskubidea, beste bitarteko eta formatuetan erabili ahal izateko eskubideok. Baimendunak berariaz lagatzen ez dituen eskubide guztiak erreserbatu egiten dira, barne direla, azalpen gisara baina ez hartara mugatuta, 4.e atalean xedatutakoak, eta legeetan aitortutako eskubide moral lagaezinak. Datu baseen gaineki sui generis eskubideei buruzko Europako arteztaraua gauzatzen duen lege nazionalaren arabera, bakarreko eskubideak badagozkio baimendunari, uko egiten eskubide horiei.
4. Murrizketak. Baimen honek ematen duen eskubide-lagapena murrizketa hauen mende dago mugatua:
Baimen honen baldintzen pean soilik erreproduzitu, banatu edo jendaurrean hedatu dezakezu lana edo prestazioa, eta baimenaren kopia edota URIa (Uniform Resource Identifier) erantsi behar diozu. Ezin duzu lanaren edo prestazioaren gainean baldintzarik eskani edo ezarri, baimen honetako baldintzak edot lagapen-hartzaileen eskubide erabilera ezertan aldatu edo murrizten baditu. Ezin duzu lana edo prestazioa birbaimendu. Oso-osorik gorde behar dituzu baimen honi buruzko eta berme ezari buruzko ohar guztiak. Ezin duzu lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu edo jendaurrean hedatu lanaren eskuratzea edo erabilera baimen honetako baldintzen aurka kontrolatzen duten bitarteko teknologikoez. Bilduma batean txertatutako lanari edo prestazioari ere eragiten dio 4.a atal honek, baina horrek ez du esan nahi bilduma osorik baimen honen mende gelditzen edo gelditu behar besterik gabe. Eskatzen bazaizu, baimendunak hala adierazita, lana edo prestazioa bilduma batean txertatzen baduzu, kendu beharko dituzu 4.c paragrafoan eskatzen diren kredituak, ahal duzun neurrian.
Aurreko 3. atalean lagatako eskubideak ezin dituzu inolaz ere erabili zure ekintzen xede edo joera nagusia baldin bada merkataritza irabazia edo diru ordainketa pribatua lortzea. Lanaren trukean beste lan jabetza intelektualak babestutakoak eskuratzea, fitxategiak partekatzeko sistemen bitartez, ez da merkataritza irabazia edo diru trukeko ordainketa lortzea xede edo joera nagusia duen jardueratzat hartuko, baldin eta babestutako lan horien trukeari buruz ez badago inolako diru ordainketarik
Lana edo prestazioa, nahiz hura jasotzen duen bilduma bat erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzen baduzu, ukitu gabe gorde behar dituzu jabetza intelektuari buruzko ohar guztiak, eta erabitzen ari zaren bitartekoen arabera, arrazoizko eran adierazi:
jatorrizko egilearen izena, edo goitizen behar bada, baita jatorrizko jabearena ere, horren berri ematen badizute;
jatorrizko jabeak edo baimendunak lege-oharrean, erabilera baldintzetan edota beste arrazoizko atalen batean jaso beharrekotzat izendatzen dituzten aldeen izenak (adibidez: erakundea, argitalpena, aldizkaria);
lanaren edo prestazioaren izenburua, horren berri ematen badizute;
baimendunak zehaztutakoaren arabera, lanari edo prestazioari estekatzeko URIa, non eta URI horrek ez duen zer ikusirik lege-oharrarekin edo lanaren edo prestazioaren baimen argibideekin;
Aitorpen hori zentzuzko eran egin behar da. Bilduma batean txertatua denean, aitorpena agertu behar da, gutxienik, beste egile edo jabeen aipamenak ageri diren leku berean eta era berdintsuan. Zalantzarik ez izateko, atal honetan eskatzen diren kredituak erabili behar dira, soil-solik, lanaren edo prestazioaren aitorpena egiteko, arestian zehaztutako eran. Aldez aurretik idatzko baimena izan ezik, zuk ezin duzu baieztatu edo era inplizitu nahiz esplizituan aditzera eman jatorrizko jabearekiko, baimendunarekiko edota aitortutako aldeekiko inolako lotura, babes edo onarpenik duzunik, ez zuk, ez lanaz edo prestazioaz egiten duzun erabilerak.
Zalantzarik ez izateko, nabarmendu behar da aurreko murrizketak (4.a, 4.b eta 4.c atalak) ez zaizkiela aplikatzen datu basen gaineko sui generis eskubideei buruzko Europako arteztaraua gauzatzen duen lege nazionalaren indarrez baskarrik babes daitezkeen lanaren edo prestazioaren zatiei.
Zalantzarik egon ez dadin, jatorrizko jabeak beretzat gordetzen ditu:
lana edo prestazioa ustiatzeko ekintzen truke dagozkion ordainsariak edo kalte-ordainak jasotzeko eskubidea, legeak lagaezintzat eta besterenezintzat jotzen dituen guztietan, eta nahitaezko kudeaketa kolektiboaren mende daudenetan.
4.b atalaren arabera baimen honen mende galdeitzen ez diren alderdietan, lanaz edo prestazioaz zuk egiten dituzun ustiapen ekintzen truke ordainsariak jasotzeko bakarreko eskubidea, nahiz bakarka, nahiz eskubideen kudeatze kolektiboko entitateen bitartez.
5. Erantzukizunei uko egitea
BAIMENDUNAK LANA EDO PRESTAZIOA DAGOEN-DAGOEN ESKAINTZEN DU, ALDEEK BESTERIK ELKAR HARTZEN EZ DUTEN BITARTEAN, ETA EZ DU INOLAKO BERMERIK EMATEN LANARI EDO PRESTAZIOARI BURUZ EDOTA BERTAN EGON DAITEZKEEN AKATSEZ, ATZEMANAK IZAN EDO EZ. JURISDIKZIO BATZUETAN EZIN DIRA BERME HORIEK SALBUETSI, ETA AGIAN SALBUESPEN HORI EZ DA ZURETZAT APLIKAGARRI IZANGO.
6. Erantzukizuna mugatzea.
APLIKATZEKOA DEN LEGEAK BERARIAZ ETA AGINDUZ HALA XEDATZEN EZ BADU, BAIMENDUNA EZ DA ZUREKIKO ERANTZULE IZANGO SORTUTAKO KALTEENGATIK, DIRELA OROKORRAK, DIRELA BEREZIAK (BARNE DIRA SORTUTAKO KALTEAK ETA ESKURATU GABEKO IRABAZIAK), HALABEHARREZKOAK ZEIN USTEKABEKOAK, ZUZENEKOAK NAHIZ ZEHARKAKOAK, BAIMEN HONI EDO LANAREN EDO PRESTAZIOAREN ERABILERARI LOTURIK SORTUTAKOAK, ARE BAIMENDUNARI KALTE HORIEN AUKERAREN BERRI EMANA BALDIN BAZAIO ERE.
7. Baimen amaiera
Baimen hau eta beraren ondorioz lagatako eskubideak beste gabe amaituko dira baimenaren baldintza guztiak betetzen ez badira. Baimen honen mende zuregandik bildumak jaso dituzten pertsonen edo erakundeen baimenak, ordea, ez dira amaituko pertsona edo erakunde horiek baimen honen baldintza guztiak betetzen jarraitzen badute. Baimen honetako 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 eta 8. atalek indarrean jarraituko dute baimen honen indarraldia amaitu arren.
Aurreko baldintza eta betebeharren arabera, baimen honen eskubide-lagapena jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen indarraldi osorako da, legeen arabera. Aurrekoa hala izanik ere, baimendunak beretzat gordetzen du lana beste baldintza batzuetan hedatu edo argitaratzeko eskubidea, eta noiznahi aldaratzekoa. Nolanahi den ere, horrek ez du baimen hau amaitutzat harraraziko (ez eta baimen honen baldintzapean emandako edo eman beharreko beste baimenik ere), indarrean jarraituko baitu ondorio guztietarako, aurrez xedatutakoaren arabera amaitzen den arte, jabetza intelektualaren legeak aitortzen duen damuaren eskubide morala baztertu gabe.
8. Orotarikoa
Zuk lana edo prestazioa, edota hura erantsita duen bilduma bat, ustiatzen duzun bakoitzean, jatorrizko baimendunak hirugarren eta hurrengo baimen hartzaileei eskaintzen die lanaren edo prestazioaren gaineko eskubide-lagapena, zuri emandako baimenaren betebehar eta baldintza berberetan.
Baimen honetan jasotako xedapenen bat baliogabea edo aplikaezina baldin bada legearen arabera, horrek ez dio eragingo baimen honetako gainerako baldintzen balioari edo aplikagarritasunari, eta hitzarmen honen aldeek beste ezer egin behar izanik gabe, xedapen hori ezinbestekoa den neurrian birmoldatutzat joko da baliozkoa eta betebeharrekoa izan dadin.
Ez da onartuko baimen honen xedapen edo baldintzaren bati uko egiterik, edo hura urratzeko onespenik, uko egite hori edo urratze-onespen hori ez badago idatziz emana, eta uko egiten duen edo onesten duen aldeak izenpetua.
Baimen hau aldeen orobateko hitzarmena da, baimenaren gai den lanari edo prestazioari dagokionez. Ez dago lanaren edo prestazioaren gaineko interpretaziorik, adostasunik edo baldintzarik ezartzerik, ez badaude baimen honetan berariaz zehaztuta. Baimenduna ez da zuk berari bidalitako jakinarazpenetan ager daitezkeen xedapen osagarrien mende egongo. Baimen hau ezin da aldatu baimendunaren eta zure arteko adostasun idatziaz ez bada.
Creative Commons-en oharra
Creative Commons ez da baimen honen partaide eta ez du inolako bermerik eskaintzen lanari edo prestazioari buruz. Creative Commons ez da zurekiko nahiz besterekiko erantzule izango, edozein teoria legalen arabera, sortutako kalteengatik, barne direlarik, baina ez bakarrik, kalte orokor zein bereziak (barne dira sortutako kalteak eta eskuratu gabeko irabaziak), halabeharrezkoak zein ustekabekoak, baimen honi loturik sortutakoak. Aurreko bi (2) perpausetan adierazitakoa hala izanik ere, Creative Commons berariazko baimendun gisa identifikatua baldin bada, baimendunaren eskubide eta betebehar guztiak izango ditu.
Lana edo prestazioa Creative Commons-en baimen publikoaren mende baimenduta dagoela jendeari adierazteko xede mugatuaz gain, inork ez du erabiliko «Creative Commons» marka erregistraturik, edo «Creative Commons»-ekin lotutako beste marka erregistratu edo ezaugarririk, hark berariaz onespenik eman gabe. Baimendutako erabilera guztiak «Creative Commons» marka erregistratua erabiltzeko une bakoitzean indarrean diren jarraibideen arabera egingo dira, haren webgunean argitaratu edo aurrez eskaturik ematen diren neurrian. Zalantzarik ez izateko, marka erabiltzeko murrisketa horiek ez dira baimenaren zati.

1. Definicións
A obra é a creación literaria, artística ou científica ofrecida nos termos desta licenza.
Nesta licenza considérase unha prestación calquera interpretación, execución, fonograma, gravación audiovisual, emisión ou transmisión, simple fotografía ou outros obxectos protexidos pola lexislación de propiedade intelectual vixente aplicábel.
A aplicación desta licenza a unha colección (definida máis adiante) afectaralle unicamente á súa estrutura en canto forma de expresión da selección ou disposición dos seus contidos, mais non é extensiva a estes. Neste caso a colección terá a consideración de obra para os efectos desta licenza.
O titular orixinario é:
No caso dunha obra literaria, artística ou científica, a persoa natural ou grupo de persoas que creou a obra.
No caso dunha obra colectiva, a persoa que a edite e divulgue baixo o seu nome, salvo pacto contrario.
No caso dunha interpretación ou execución, o actor, cantante, músico, ou calquera outra persoa que represente, cante, lea, recite, interprete ou execute de calquera forma unha obra.
No caso dun fonograma, o produtor fonográfico, é dicir, a persoa natural ou xurídica baixo a iniciativa e responsabilidade da cal se realiza por primeira vez unha fixación exclusivamente sonora da execución dunha obra ou doutros sons.
No caso dunha gravación audiovisual, o produtor da gravación, é dicir, a persoa natural ou xurídica que teña a iniciativa e asuma a responsabilidade das fixacións dun plano ou secuencia de imaxes, con ou sen son.
No caso dunha emisión ou dunha transmisión, a entidade de radiodifusión.
No caso dunha simple fotografía, aquela persoa que a realizou.
No caso doutros obxectos protexidos pola lexislación de propiedade intelectual vixente, a persoa que esta indique.
Consideraranse obras derivadas aquelas obras creadas a partir da licenciada, como por exemplo: as traducións e adaptacións; as revisións, actualizacións e anotacións; os compendios, resumos e extractos; os arranxos musicais e, en xeral, calquera transformación dunha obra literaria, artística ou científica. Para evitar a dúbida, se a obra consiste nunha composición musical ou gravación de sons, a sincronización temporal da obra cunha imaxe en movemento (synching) será considerada como unha obra derivada para os efectos desta licenza.
Terán a consideración de coleccións a compilación de obras alleas, de datos ou doutros elementos independentes como as antoloxías e as bases de datos que pola selección ou disposición dos seus contidos constitúan creacións intelectuais. A simple incorporación dunha obra nunha colección non dará lugar a unha derivada para os efectos desta licenza.
O licenciador é a persoa ou a entidade que ofrece a obra ou prestación nos termos desta licenza e lle concede os seus dereitos de explotación conforme o disposto nela.
Vostede é a persoa ou a entidade que exerce os dereitos concedidos mediante esta licenza e que non violou previamente os seus termos con respecto á obra ou á prestación, ou que recibiu o permiso expreso do licenciador para exercer os dereitos concedidos mediante esta licenza a pesar dunha violación anterior.
A transformación dunha obra comprende a súa tradución, adaptación e calquera outra modificación na súa forma da que se derive unha obra diferente. A creación resultante da transformación dunha obra terá a consideración de obra derivada.
Enténdese por reprodución a fixación directa ou indirecta, provisional ou permanente, por calquera medio e en calquera forma, de toda a obra ou a prestación ou de parte dela, que permita a súa comunicación ou a obtención de copias.
Enténdese por distribución a posta a disposición do público do orixinal ou das copias da obra ou da prestación, nun soporte tanxible, mediante a súa venda, alugueiro, préstamo ou de calquera outra forma.
Enténdese por comunicación pública todo acto polo cal unha pluralidade de persoas, que non pertenzan ao ámbito doméstico de quen a leva a cabo, poida ter acceso á obra ou á prestación sen previa distribución de exemplares a cada unha delas. Considérase comunicación pública a posta a disposición do público de obras ou prestacións por procedementos con fíos ou sen fíos, de tal forma que calquera persoa poida acceder a elas dende o lugar e no momento que elixa.
A explotación da obra ou a prestación comprende a reprodución, a distribución, a comunicación pública e, no seu caso, a transformación.
2. Límites dos dereitos. Nada nesta licenza pretende reducir ou restrinxir calquera dos límites legais dos dereitos exclusivos do titular dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual de acordo coa Lei de Propiedade Intelectual ou calquera outra lei aplicábel, xa sexan derivados de usos lexítimos, tales como a copia privada ou a cita, ou outras limitacións como o resultante da primeira venda de exemplares (esgotamento).
3. Concesión de licenza. Conforme os termos e ás condicións desta licenza, o licenciador concede, polo prazo de protección dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual e a título gratuíto, unha licenza de ámbito mundial non exclusiva que inclúe os seguintes dereitos:
Dereito de reprodución, distribución e comunicación pública da obra ou da prestación.
Dereito a incorporar a obra ou a prestación nunha ou máis coleccións.
Dereito de reprodución, distribución e comunicación pública da obra ou da prestación licitamente incorporada nunha colección.
Dereito a extraer e reutilizar a obra ou a prestación dunha base de datos.
Estes dereitos pódense exercer en todos os medios e formatos, tanxíbeis ou intanxíbeis, coñecidos no momento da concesión desta licenza. Os dereitos mencionados inclúen o dereito a efectuar as modificacións que sexan precisas tecnicamente para o exercicio dos dereitos noutros medios e formatos. Todos os dereitos non concedidos expresamente polo licenciador quedan reservados, incluíndo a título enunciativo pero non limitativo, os establecidos na sección 4.e, así como os dereitos morais irrenunciábeis recoñecidos pola lei aplicábel. Na medida en que o licenciador teña dereitos exclusivos previstos pola lei nacional vixente que implementa a directiva europea en materia de dereito sui generis sobre bases de datos, renuncia expresamente aos devanditos dereitos exclusivos.
4. Restricións. A concesión de dereitos que supón esta licenza atópase suxeita e limitada ás restricións seguintes:
Vostede pode reproducir, distribuír ou comunicar publicamente a obra ou prestación soamente baixo os termos desta licenza e debe incluír unha copia dela, ou o seu Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI). Vostede non pode ofrecer ou impoñer ningunha condición sobre a obra ou prestación que altere ou restrinxa os termos desta licenza ou o exercicio dos seus dereitos por parte dos seus concesionarios. Vostede non pode sublicenciar a obra ou prestación. Vostede debe manter intactos todos os avisos que se refiran a esta licenza e á ausencia de garantías. Vostede non pode reproducir, distribuír ou comunicar publicamente a obra ou prestación con medidas tecnolóxicas que controlen o acceso ou o uso dun xeito contrario aos termos desta licenza. Esta sección 4.a tamén afecta á obra ou prestación incorporada nunha colección, pero iso non implica que esta no seu conxunto quede automaticamente ou deba quedar suxeita aos seus termos. No caso que lle sexa requirido, logo de comunicación do licenciador, se vostede incorpora a obra nunha colección, deberá quitar calquera crédito requirido no apartado 4.c, na medida do posíbel.
Vostede non pode exercer ningún dos dereitos concedidos na sección 3 anterior de maneira que pretenda principalmente ou a súa actuación se dirixa á obtención dun beneficio mercantil ou unha contraprestación monetaria. O intercambio da obra por outras obras protexidas pola propiedade intelectual mediante sistemas de compartir arquivos non se considerará como un xeito que pretenda principalmente ou se atope dirixida cara á obtención dun beneficio mercantil ou unha contraprestación monetaria, sempre que non haxa ningún pagamento en relación co intercambio das obras protexidas.
Se vostede reproduce, distribúe ou comunica publicamente a obra ou a prestación, ou unha colección que a incorpore, debe manter intactos todos os avisos sobre a propiedade intelectual e indicar, de xeito razoábel conforme ao medio ou aos medios que vostede estea a empregar:
O nome do autor orixinal, ou o pseudónimo se é o caso, así como o do titular orixinario, se lle é facilitado.
O nome daquelas partes (por exemplo: institución, publicación, revista) que o titular orixinario e/ou o licenciador designen para ser recoñecidos no aviso legal, as condicións de uso, ou de calquera outro xeito razoábel.
O título da obra ou da prestación se lle é facilitado.
O URI, se existe, que o licenciador especifique para ser vinculado á obra ou á prestación, a menos que tal URI non se refira ao aviso legal ou á información sobre a licenza da obra ou a prestación.
Este recoñecemento debe facerse de xeito razoábel. No caso de incorporación nunha colección estes créditos deberán aparecer como mínimo no mesmo lugar onde se achen os correspondentes a outros autores ou titulares e de forma comparábel a estes. Para evitar a dúbida, os créditos requiridos nesta sección só serán empregados para os efectos de atribución da obra ou a prestación no xeito especificado anteriormente. Sen un permiso previo por escrito, vostede non pode afirmar nin dar a entender implicitamente nin explicitamente ningunha conexión, patrocinio ou aprobación por parte do titular orixinario, o licenciador e/ou as partes recoñecidas cara a vostede ou cara ao uso que fai da obra ou a prestación.
Para evitar calquera dúbida, debe facerse notar que as restricións anteriores (parágrafos 4.a, 4.b e 4.c) non son de aplicación a aquelas partes da obra ou a prestación obxecto desta licenza que unicamente poidan ser protexidas mediante o dereito sui generis sobre bases de datos recollido pola lei nacional vixente que transpoña a directiva europea de bases de datos.
Para evitar calquera dúbida, o titular orixinario conserva:
O dereito a percibir as remuneracións ou compensacións previstas por actos de explotación da obra ou prestación, cualificadas pola lei como irrenunciábeis e inalienábeis e suxeitas a xestión colectiva obrigatoria.
O dereito exclusivo a percibir, tanto individualmente como mediante unha entidade de xestión colectiva de dereitos, calquera remuneración derivada de actos de explotación da obra ou prestación que vostede realice que non queden suxeitos a esta licenza de acordo co establecido no apartado 4.b.
5. Ausencia de responsabilidade
SALVO QUE SE CONVEÑA MUTUAMENTE DOUTRO XEITO POLAS PARTES, O LICENCIADOR OFRECE A OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN TAL CAL (ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS) E NON CONFIRE NINGUNHA GARANTÍA DE NINGÚN TIPO RESPECTO DA OBRA OU DA PRESTACIÓN OU DA PRESENZA OU AUSENCIA DE ERROS QUE POIDAN OU NON SER DESCUBERTOS. ALGUNHAS XURISDICIÓNS NON PERMITEN A EXCLUSIÓN DAS DITAS GARANTÍAS, POLO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PODE NON SERLLE DE APLICACIÓN A VOSTEDE.
6. Limitación de responsabilidade. SALVO QUE O DISPOÑA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE A LEI APLICÁBEL, EN NINGÚN CASO O LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSÁBEL ANTE VOSTEDE POR CALQUERA DANO RESULTANTE, XERAL OU ESPECIAL (INCLUÍDO O DANO EMERXENTE E O LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUÍTOS OU CAUSAIS, DIRECTOS OU INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENZA OU O USO DA OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN, MESMO SE O LICENCIADOR FOSE INFORMADO DA POSIBILIDADE DE TALES DANOS.
7. Finalización da licenza
Esta licenza e a concesión dos dereitos que contén rematarán automaticamente en caso de calquera incumprimento dos seus termos. As persoas ou entidades que recibiran de vostede coleccións baixo esta licenza, non obstante, non verán as súas licenzas finalizadas, sempre que tales persoas ou entidades se manteñan no cumprimento íntegro desta licenza. As seccións 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 permanecerán vixentes malia calquera finalización desta licenza.
Conforme ás condicións e termos anteriores, a concesión de dereitos desta licenza é vixente por todo o prazo de protección dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual segundo a lei aplicábel. Malia o anterior, o licenciador resérvase o dereito a divulgar ou publicar a obra ou a prestación en condicións distintas ás presentes, ou de retirar a obra ou a prestación en calquera momento. Non obstante, iso non suporá dar por concluída esta licenza (ou calquera outra licenza que fose concedida, ou sexa necesario ser concedida, baixo os termos desta licenza), que continuará vixente e con efectos completos a non ser que finalizara conforme ao establecido anteriormente, sen prexuízo do dereito moral de arrepentimento nos termos recoñecidos pola Lei de Propiedade Intelectual aplicábel.
8. Miscelánea
Cada vez que vostede realice calquera tipo de explotación da obra ou a prestación, ou dunha colección que a incorpore, o licenciador ofrece aos terceiros e sucesivos licenciatarios a concesión de dereitos sobre a obra ou a prestación nas mesmas condicións e termos que a licenza concedida a vostede.
Se algunha disposición desta licenza resulta inválida ou inaplicábel segundo a Lei vixente, iso non afectará a validez ou aplicabilidade do resto dos termos desta licenza e, sen ningunha acción adicional por calquera das partes deste acordo, tal disposición entenderase reformada no estritamente necesario para facer que tal disposición sexa válida e executiva.
Non se entenderá que existe renuncia respecto de ningún termo ou disposición desta licenza, nin que se consente ningunha violación desta, a menos que tal renuncia ou consentimento figure por escrito e leve a sinatura da parte que renuncie ou consinta.
Esta licenza constitúe o acordo pleno entre as partes con respecto á obra ou a prestación obxecto da licenza. Non caben interpretacións, acordos ou condicións con respecto á obra ou a prestación que non se atopen expresamente especificados na presente licenza. O licenciador non estará obrigado por ningunha disposición complementaria que poida aparecer en calquera comunicación que faga chegar vostede. Esta licenza non se pode modificar sen o mutuo acordo por escrito entre o licenciador e vostede.

Malia as dúas (2) oracións anteriores, se Creative Commons se identificou expresamente como o licenciador, terá todos os dereitos e obrigas do licenciador.

Licence
L'ŒUVRE (TELLE QUE DEFINIE CI-DESSOUS) EST MISE A DISPOSITION SELON LES TERMES DE CETTE LICENCE PUBLIQUE CREATIVE COMMONS (CI-APRES DENOMMEE « LPCC » OU « LICENCE »). L'ŒUVRE EST PROTEGEE PAR LE DROIT DE LA PROPRIETE LITTERAIRE ET ARTISTIQUE OU TOUTE AUTRE LOI APPLICABLE. TOUTE UTILISATION DE L'ŒUVRE AUTRE QUE CELLE AUTORISEE PAR CETTE LICENCE EST RÉSERVÉE.
L’EXERCICE DE TOUT DROIT SUR L’ŒUVRE MISE A DISPOSITION EMPORTE ACCEPTATION DES TERMES DE LA LICENCE. EN RAISON DU CARACTERE CONTRACTUEL DE LA LICENCE, L’OFFRANT ACCORDE A L’ACCEPTANT LES DROITS CONTENUS DANS CETTE LICENCE EN CONTREPARTIE DE SON ACCEPTATION.
1. Définitions
Adaptation : œuvre créée soit à partir de l’Œuvre seule, soit à partir de l’Œuvre et d’autres œuvres préexistantes. Constituent notamment des Adaptations, les traductions, adaptations, œuvres composites, arrangements ou modifications d’une œuvre littéraire et artistique, d’un phonogramme, d’un vidéogramme ou d’une interprétation d’une œuvre, y compris les adaptations cinématographiques ou toute autre forme dans laquelle l’Œuvre est susceptible d’être refondue, transformée ou adaptée, notamment toute forme dérivée de l’original de manière identifiable. Il est toutefois entendu qu’une Œuvre qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence. Au cas où l’Œuvre serait une création musicale, une interprétation ou un phonogramme, la synchronisation de l’Œuvre avec une image animée sera considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence.
Collection : recueil d’œuvres qui, en raison de la sélection et de l’arrangement de son contenu, constitue une création intellectuelle dans laquelle chaque Œuvre se trouve incluse dans son ensemble, sous une forme non modifiée, avec une ou plusieurs autres contributions, chacune d’elles constituant des œuvres en elles-mêmes indépendantes et distinctes qui sont rassemblées pour former cet ensemble. Constituent notamment des Collections, les encyclopédies, anthologies, interprétations, phonogrammes, vidéogrammes ou émissions, ou toute œuvre autre que celles désignées à l’article 1(f). Aux fins de la présente Licence, une création qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation (telle que définie ci-dessus).
Distribution : mise à disposition du public de la version originale ou des copies de l'Œuvre, par la vente ou tout autre transfert de propriété ou par tout mode de communication au public dans la mesure où ces activités sont sources de droits exclusifs (location, prêt, etc).
Offrant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou la ou les entité(s) qui mettent l’Œuvre à la disposition du public selon les termes de la présente Licence.
Titulaire de Droits Originaire : dans l’hypothèse d’une œuvre littéraire ou artistique, l’Auteur, entendu comme la ou les personnes physiques ou morales ou les entités qui ont créé l'Œuvre; et en outre, le cas échéant, (i) dans l’hypothèse d’une interprétation, les acteurs, chanteurs, musiciens, danseurs, ou toute autre personne qui joue, chante, déclame ou interprète l’œuvre littéraire, artistique ou folklorique; (ii) dans l’hypothèse d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme, le producteur, entendu comme la personne physique ou morale qui procède à la première fixation de l’interprétation sur un support; (iii) dans l’hypothèse d’une émission, l’entreprise de communication audiovisuelle qui procède à la diffusion de l’émission; (iv) dans l’hypothèse d’une base de données, le producteur.
Œuvre : création protégeable par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique (droits d'auteur, droits voisins et droits sui generis des producteurs de bases de données) mise à disposition selon les termes de la Licence. Peuvent notamment constituer une Œuvre toute création dans le domaine littéraire, scientifique et artistique, quel qu'en soit le mode ou la forme d'expression, y compris sous forme numérique, telle qu’un livre, un pamphlet et autres écrits ; une conférence, une allocution, une plaidoirie, un cours ou un sermon ou d'autres œuvres de même nature ; une œuvre dramatique ou une comédie musicale ; une œuvre chorégraphique ou un pantomime ; une composition musicale avec ou sans paroles ; une œuvre cinématographique à laquelle sont assimilées des œuvres exprimées par un procédé analogue à la cinématographie ; un dessin, une peinture, une création architecturale, une sculpture, une gravure ou une lithographie ; une création photographique à laquelle sont assimilées des œuvres exprimées par un procédé analogue à la photographie ; une œuvre des arts appliqués ; une œuvre graphique et typographique ; une illustration, une carte, un plan, un croquis ou une œuvre tridimensionnelle relative à la géographie, la topographie, l'architecture ou aux sciences ; une interprétation, une émission ; un phonogramme ou un vidéogramme ; une anthologie ou un recueil d’œuvres ou de données diverses ou une base de données dans la mesure où elle est protégée par le droit d’auteur ou le droit des producteurs de bases de données à la condition que celles-ci soient protégées par le droit applicable qui ne couvre pas seulement les bases de données protégées par le droit d'auteur (pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les sections 3(a) et 3(b) ne s'appliqueront pas quand seul le droit des producteurs de bases de données s'applique); une interprétation réalisée par un artiste de cirque ou de variété ; les créations des industries saisonnières de l'habillement et de la parure.
Acceptant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou entité(s) qui exercent sur l’Œuvre les droits accordés par cette Licence et qui n’ont pas précédemment violé les conditions de cette Licence ou qui ont reçu l’autorisation expresse de la part de l’Offrant d’exercer les droits conférés par cette licence malgré une violation précédente.
Représentation : représentation de l’Œuvre et communications au public de ces représentations publiques par un procédé quelconque, quelque soit le type de transmission, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d’exploitation prévus par le droit applicable. Constitue également notamment une communication au public, la mise à disposition d’Œuvres protégées de manière à ce que le public puisse y avoir accès de l’endroit et au moment qu’il choisit individuellement, les interprétations et communications au public des interprétations de l'Œuvre y compris les interprétations publiques au format numérique ainsi qu’une diffusion ou une rediffusion de l’Œuvre par tout moyen, notamment par des signes, des sons ou des images.
Reproduction : toute copie de l'Œuvre de quelque manière et sous quelque forme que ce soit, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d'exploitation prévus par le droit applicable. Constitue aussi notamment une Reproduction, un enregistrement sonore ou visuel, une fixation ou une reproduction de fixations de l'Œuvre, y compris le stockage d'une interprétation, d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme au format numérique ou sur tout autre support électronique.
2. Exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs. Les exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs prévues par la loi applicable ne sont pas affectées par la présente Licence.
3. Étendue de l’autorisation. Sous réserve des conditions de la présente Licence, l’Offrant autorise l’Acceptant à exercer à titre gratuit, non-exclusif, pour la durée de protection des droits applicables et pour le monde entier, les droits de :
Reproduire, Distribuer et Représenter l'Œuvre, incorporer l'Œuvre dans une ou plusieurs Collections et reproduire l'Œuvre même incorporée dans lesdites Collections; et
Lorsque l'Œuvre est une base de données soumise au droit des producteurs de bases de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles.
Pour eviter toute ambiguïté, les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous supports, médias, procédés, techniques et dans tous formats, incluant, dans la mesure du possible, les futurs médias et formats. Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus incluent le droit d'effectuer les modifications techniquement nécessaires à leur exercice sur d’autres supports, médias, procédés, techniques et formats, sans toutefois inclure le droit de créer des Adaptations. Les droits qui ne sont pas expressément accordés par l’Offrant à l’Acceptant par la présente Licence sont réservés, notamment dans les cas prévus à l’article 4(e). Dans le cas où l'Offrant est titulaire de droits sui generis sur les bases de données conformément à la loi nationale transposant la Directive Européenne sur les bases de données, l'Offrant renonce à ce droit.
4. Restrictions. L'autorisation accordée par l'Article 3 est expressément soumise et limitée par les restrictions suivantes :
L'Acceptant peut Distribuer ou Représenter l'Œuvre uniquement selon les termes de cette licence. Il doit inclure une copie de la Licence, ou son Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource (URI), à toute copie de l'Œuvre qu'il Distribue ou Représente. L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation sur l'Œuvre qui restreignent les termes de la Licence ou la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur d'exercer les droits qui lui sont accordés par cette Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut consentir de sous-licence sur l'Œuvre. Il doit conserver intacts tous les avertissements qui se réfèrent à cette Licence et l’avertissement sur les garanties avec chaque copie de l’Œuvre qu’il distribue ou représente. Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre, il ne doit pas imposer de mesure technique de protection susceptible de restreindre la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur à exercer les droits conférés par la présente Licence. L’article 4(a) s’applique à l’Œuvre telle qu’incorporée dans une Collection, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que la Collection soit soumise aux conditions de la Licence. Si l'Acceptant crée une Collection, il doit, à la demande de tout Offrant et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de la Collection toute référence audit Offrant, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(c), et ce conformément à la demande.
L'Acceptant ne peut exercer aucun des droits qui lui ont été accordés à l'article 3 d’une manière telle qu’il aurait l'intention première ou l'objectif d'obtenir un avantage commercial ou une compensation financière privée. L’échange de l’Œuvre avec d’autres œuvres soumises au droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique par voie de partage de fichiers numériques ou autrement ne sera pas considérée comme ayant l'intention première ou l'objectif d'obtenir un avantage commercial ou une compensation financière privée, à condition qu’il n’y ait aucun paiement d’une compensation financière en connection avec l’échange des œuvres soumises au droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique.
Sauf introduction d’une demande prévue à l’Article 4(a), l'Acceptant doit, lorsqu'il distribue ou représente l'Œuvre, ou toute Collection, garder intacts tous les avertissements sur les droits d’auteur concernant l’Œuvre et fournir, de manière appropriée au support ou au média qu'il utilise : (i) le nom du Titulaire de Droits Originaire (ou le pseudonyme, le cas échéant) s'il est mentionné, et/ou si le Titulaire de Droits Originaire et/ou l’Offrant désigne une ou des parties (par exemple un organisme de financement, un éditeur ou un journal) à attribuer (« les Parties à Attribuer ») dans l’avertissement sur les droits d’auteur de l’Offrant, les conditions d’utilisation ou, par un autre moyen approprié, le nom de la Partie ou des Parties à Attribuer ; (ii) le titre de l’Œuvre, s’il est mentionné; et (iii) dans la mesure du possible, l’URI que l'Offrant spécifie comme étant associée à l’Œuvre, sauf si ledit URI ne fait pas référence à l’avertissement sur les droits ou aux informations sur la licence relative à l’Œuvre. Les crédits requis par cet article 4(c) pourront être mis en œuvre par tout moyen approprié, sous réserve, toutefois, qu’en cas d'une Collection, ces crédits figurent d’une manière au moins aussi visible que les crédits relatifs aux autres auteurs y ayant contribué, si de tels crédits apparaissent. A toutes fins utiles, l'Acceptant ne pourra utiliser les crédits requis par cet Article qu'à des fins d’attribution, de la manière susmentionnée et en exerçant les droits accordés par la Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut, implicitement ou explicitement, affirmer ou laisser supposer une quelconque relation, parrainage ou aval par le Titulaire de Droits Originaire, l'Offrant, la ou les Parties à Attribuer selon le cas, et l’Acceptant ou son utilisation de l’Œuvre, sans avoir l’autorisation distincte, expresse, écrite et préalable du Titulaire de Droits Originaire, de l'Offrant et/ou des Parties à Attribuer.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les restrictions accordées par l’article 3 et l'article 4(a) ne sont pas applicables à la partie de l’œuvre qui est soumise uniquement aux droits des producteurs de bases de données.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté :
Régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire.  Dans les cas où des utilisations de l'Œuvre seraient soumises à un régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire (auquel le droit ne permet pas de renoncer), l'Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances par l'intermédiaire de la société de perception et de répartition des droits compétente. Sont notamment concernés la radiodiffusion et la communication dans un lieu public de phonogrammes publiés à des fins de commerce, certains cas de retransmission par câble et satellite, la copie privée d'Œuvres fixées sur phonogrammes ou vidéogrammes, la reproduction par reprographie, le prêt en bibliothèque ;
Régime de gestion collective obligatoire assorti de possibilité de renonciation.  Dans les juridictions où il est possible de renoncer au droit de percevoir des redevances au titre d'un quelconque régime de licence légale ou de gestion collective obligatoire, l’Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de percevoir lesdites redevances découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits consentis en vertu de la présente Licence, dès lors que lesdits droits sont exercés par l'Acceptant à des fins ou en vue d’une utilisation autre que non commerciale, telle que permise à l’Article 4(b), et renonce en tout autre cas au droit de percevoir des redevances au titre de tout régime de licence légale ou de gestion collective obligatoire;
Régime de gestion collective facultative.  L’Offrant se réserve le droit de percevoir des redevances (que ce soit à titre individuel ou, au cas où l’Offrant serait membre d’un organisme de gestion collective facultative, par le biais de cet organisme) découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits accordés par la présente Licence, dès lors que lesdits droits sont exercés à des fins ou en vue d’un usage autre que non commercial, tel que défini à l’Article 4(b). Dans les utilisations à des fins non commerciales telles que définies à l'Article 4(b), l'Offrant renonce à ce droit.
A moins d’une limitation aux droits exclusifs prévue par la loi applicable, si l’Acceptant Reproduit, Distribue ou Représente l’Œuvre en elle-même, ou au sein d’une Collection, il doit respecter les droits moraux du Titulaire de Droits Originaire dans la mesure où ce Titulaire en bénéficie (comme les auteurs et les artistes-interprètes) et ne peut y renoncer.
5. Représentation, Garanties et Avertissement
SAUF ACCORD CONTRAIRE CONVENU PAR ECRIT ENTRE LES PARTIES ET DANS LA LIMITE DU DROIT APPLICABLE, L’OFFRANT MET L’ŒUVRE A DISPOSITION DE L’ACCEPTANT EN L’ETAT, SANS DECLARATION OU GARANTIE D’AUCUNE SORTE, EXPRESSE, IMPLICITE, LÉGALE OU AUTRE. SONT NOTAMMENT EXCLUES LES GARANTIES CONCERNANT LA COMMERCIABILITE, LA CONFORMITE, LES VICES CACHES ET LES VICES APPARENTS.
6. Limitation de responsabilité. A l'exception des garanties d'ordre public imposées par la loi applicable, l'Offrant ne sera en aucun cas tenu responsable vis-à-vis de l'Acceptant, sur la base d'aucune théorie juridique ni en raison d'aucun préjudice direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, résultant de l'exécution du présent Contrat ou de l'utilisation de l'Œuvre, y compris dans l'hypothèse où l'Offrant avait connaissance de la possible existence d'un tel préjudice.
7. Résiliation
Toute violation par l'Acceptant des clauses de cette Licence entraînera sa résiliation automatique et la fin des droits qui en découlent. Les Licences accordées aux personnes physiques ou morales qui ont reçu de la part de l'Acceptant des Collections dans le cadre de la présente Licence ne seront pas résiliées, à condition que lesdites personnes physiques ou morales respectent pleinement leurs obligations. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 de la présente Licence continuent à s'appliquer après la résiliation de celle-ci.
Sous réserve des conditions mentionnées ci-dessus, la présente Licence est accordée pour toute la durée du droit d'auteur ou tout autre droit applicable à l'Œuvre. Néanmoins, l'Offrant se réserve à tout moment le droit d'exploiter l'Œuvre sous une autre Licence ou d'en cesser la Distribution à tout moment. Cependant, cette décision ne devra pas conduire à retirer cette Licence (ou toute autre Licence qui a été accordée, ou doit être accordée en application de la présente Licence) qui continuera à s'appliquer dans tous ses effets à moins qu'elle ne soit résiliée dans les conditions décrites ci-dessus.
8. Divers
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre ou une Collection, l’Offrant accorde au bénéficiaire suivant, une licence sur l’Œuvre avec les mêmes termes et conditions que celle accordée à l’Acceptant.
Si en vertu de la loi applicable, une quelconque disposition de la présente Licence était déclarée nulle, non valide ou inapplicable, cela n'aurait pas pour effet d'annuler ou de rendre inapplicables les autres dispositions de la Licence. Sans action ultérieure des parties, ladite disposition sera modifiée dans la mesure minimum nécessaire à sa validité et son applicabilité.
Aucune des conditions ou des dispositions de la présente Licence ne sera réputée comme ayant fait l'objet d'une renonciation, et aucune violation comme ayant été acceptée, sans le consentement écrit et signé de la partie concernée.
La présente Licence représente l'intégralité de l'accord conclu entre les parties à propos de l'Œuvre, objet de la présente Licence. Il n'existe aucun élément annexe, accord ou mandat portant sur cette Œuvre qui ne soit mentionné ci-dessus. L'Offrant ne sera tenu par aucune disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une communication provenant de l'Acceptant. La présente Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord écrit de l'Offrant et de l'Acceptant.
Avertissements de Creative Commons
Creative Commons n'est pas partie à cette Licence et n'offre aucune forme de garantie relative à l'Œuvre. Creative Commons décline toute responsabilité à l'égard de l'Acceptant ou de toute autre partie, quel que soit le fondement légal de cette responsabilité et quel que soit le préjudice subi, direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, qui surviendrait du fait de cette Licence. Cependant, si Creative Commons s'est expressément identifié comme Offrant pour mettre une Œuvre à disposition selon les termes de cette Licence, Creative Commons jouira de tous les droits et obligations d'un Offrant.
A l'exception des utilisations limitées à indiquer au public que l'Œuvre est mise à disposition sous la licence Creative Commons, Creative Commons n'autorise l'utilisation par aucune partie de la marque « Creative Commons » ou de toute autre indication ou logo de Creative Commons sans le consentement écrit préalable de Creative Commons. Toute utilisation autorisée devra se conformer aux directives d'utilisation de la marque en vigueur telles qu'elles pourront être publiées sur le site web ou sur demande.

2. Νόμιμοι περιορισμοί (Exceptions)
Η Άδεια αυτή δεν θίγει με οποιονδήποτε τρόπο τους νόμιμους περιορισμούς του περιουσιακού δικαιώματος και το ηθικό δικαίωμα του δημιουργού βάσει του νόμου για την προστασία της πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας ή άλλων νόμων.
3. Παροχή Άδειας.
Βάσει των όρων και προϋποθέσεων της Άδειας αυτής, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια με το παρόν ιδιωτικό συμφωνητικό Σας παρέχει μια παγκόσμια, χωρίς πληρωμή (πνευματικών ή συγγενικών) δικαιωμάτων, μη αποκλειστική, διαρκή άδεια να ασκείτε τα δικαιώματα στo αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης όπως προσδιορίζεται παρακάτω:
α.
Να αναπαράγετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, να ενσωματώνετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης σε ένα ή περισσότερα Συλλογικά Έργα και να αναπαράγετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης που έχει ενσωματωθεί σε Συλλογικά Έργα.
β.
Να διανέμετε αντίγραφα και παρουσιάζετε στο κοινό το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, συμπεριλαμβανομένων και των υλικών ενσωματώσεων σε Συλλογικά Έργα.
γ.
Να κάνετε οποιαδήποτε χρήση ουσιώδους μέρους των περιεχομένων βάσης δεδομένων, στην περίπτωση που το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης είναι βάση δεδομένων.
Τα ανωτέρω δικαιώματα μπορούν να ασκηθούν με όλα τα τεχνικά μέσα και σε όλους τους υλικούς φορείς ενσωμάτωσης αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Τα ανωτέρω δικαιώματα περιλαμβάνουν το δικαίωμα να γίνονται αυτές οι μετατροπές οι οποίες είναι τεχνικά αναγκαίες για την άσκηση των δικαιωμάτων σε άλλα τεχνικά μέσα και υλικούς φορείς ενσωμάτωσης αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Υπάρχει επιφύλαξη υπέρ του δικαιούχου για όλα τα δικαιώματα που δεν παρέχονται σαφώς από τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, όπως ενδεικτικά και όχι περιοριστικά αναφέρονται τα δικαιώματα της Ρήτρας 4(ε) και 4(στ).
Στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι δικαιούχος του δικαιώματος ειδικής φύσης (sui generis) του κατασκευαστή βάσης δεδομένων σύμφωνα με τον Ελληνικό νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας, όπως αυτό ισχύει κατ’ εφαρμογή στο Ελληνικό Δίκαιο της Οδηγίας 96/9/ΕΟΚ για τη νομική προστασία των βάσεων δεδομένων, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια παραιτείται αυτού του δικαιώματός του.
4. Περιορισμοί
Η παρεχόμενη άδεια βάσει της Ρήτρας 3 όπως προσδιορίζεται παραπάνω υπόκειται στους εξής περιορισμούς:
α.
Μπορείτε να προβείτε σε διανομή, ή δημόσια εκτέλεση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης μόνον βάσει των όρων της παρούσας Άδειας. Είστε υποχρεωμένοι να περιλάβετε ένα αντίγραφο αυτής της Άδειας ή το Κανονιστικό Αναγνωριστικό Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier) της Άδειας αυτής σε κάθε αντίγραφο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης το οποίο διανέμετε, ή εκτελείτε δημοσίως. Δεν μπορείτε να επιβάλλετε όρους στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης οι οποίοι περιορίζουν τους όρους της Άδειας ή την άσκηση από τον λήπτη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης των δικαιωμάτων που παρέχονται σ’ αυτόν υπό τους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Δεν μπορείτε να χορηγήσετε άδεια περαιτέρω εκμετάλλευσης του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Πρέπει να τηρείτε άθικτες όλες τις γνωστοποιήσεις που αφορούν την Άδεια αυτή και τους περιορισμούς της ευθύνης σε κάθε αντίγραφο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που διανέμετε ή παρουσιάζετε δημόσια. Σε κάθε διανομή ή δημόσια παρουσίαση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης, δεν επιτρέπετε να κάνετε χρήση οποιουδήποτε τεχνολογικού μέτρου επί του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που έχει ως αποτέλεσμα τον περιορισμό της άσκησης από τον λήπτη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης των δικαιωμάτων που παρέχονται σ’ αυτόν υπό τους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Η παρούσα Ρήτρα 4(α) ισχύει για το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης που είναι ενσωματωμένο σε Συλλογικό Έργο, αλλά δεν απαιτείται το Συλλογικό Έργο ξεχωριστά από το ίδιο το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης να υπόκειται στους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Αν δημιουργείτε Συλλογικό Έργο, εφόσον γίνει γνωστοποίηση από τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, πρέπει, στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατόν, να αφαιρέσετε από το Συλλογικό Έργο κάθε αναφορά σε δικαιούχο όπως αυτό απαιτείται από τη Ρήτρα 4(δ).
β.
Δεν μπορείτε να ασκείτε δικαιώματα παρεχόμενα σε Σας βάσει της προαναφερόμενης Ρήτρας 3 κατά τρόπο που αποσκοπεί κυρίως σε εμπορική εκμετάλλευση ή στοχεύει σε ιδιωτική χρηματική ανταμοιβή. Η ανταλλαγή του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης με άλλα έργα προστατευμένα σύμφωνα με το νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας μέσω συστήματος ψηφιακού μοιράσματος/ανταλλαγής αρχείων ή άλλως δεν θα θεωρείται ότι αποσκοπεί ή οδηγεί σε εμπορικό πλεονέκτημα ή ιδιωτική χρηματική ανταμοιβή, υπό τον όρο ότι δεν υπάρχει πληρωμή χρηματικής αμοιβής σχετικά με την ανταλλαγή έργων προστατευμένων σύμφωνα με το νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας.
γ.
Αν διανείμετε, ή παρουσιάζετε στο κοινό το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης ή το Συλλογικό Έργο, πρέπει, εφόσον δεν έχει υποβληθεί αίτημα σχετικό με τη Ρήτρα 4(α), να κρατήσετε άθικτες όλες τις πληροφορίες για το δικαιούχο πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας και να παρέχετε, ανάλογα με το μέσον ή τα μέσα που χρησιμοποιείτε: (1) το όνομα (ή το ψευδώνυμο) του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή του Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων αν υπάρχει και/ή (2) αν ο Πρώτος Δημιουργός (Αρχικός Δικαιούχος) ή ο Δικαιούχος Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων και/ή ο Χορηγών την Άδεια ορίσει, στους όρους χρήσης ή σε άλλο σχετικό μέσο, άλλον ή άλλους (π.χ. ένα ινστιτούτο, εκδότη, περιοδικό) αναφορικά με τις πληροφορίες για τα δικαιώματα πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας όσον αφορά τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, το όνομα αυτού ή αυτών («Δικαιούχοι»). Επίσης, τον τίτλο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης αν υπάρχει, και (3) στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατό, το Κανονιστικό Αναγνωριστικό Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier), αν υπάρχει, το οποίο ο Χορηγών την Άδεια προσδιορίζει συνδεόμενο με το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, εκτός αν αυτό το Κανονιστικό Αναγνώρισης Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier) δεν αναφέρεται στις πληροφορίες για την πνευματική ιδιοκτησία ή στις πληροφορίες χορήγησης άδειας για το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης. Αυτή η αναφορά που απαιτείται σύμφωνα με τη Ρήτρα 4(δ) μπορεί να γίνει με οποιονδήποτε εύλογο τρόπο, υπό τον όρο, όμως, ότι στην περίπτωση Συλλογικού Έργου, κατ’ ελάχιστη προϋπόθεση αυτή η αναφορά θα φαίνεται όπου εμφανίζεται οποιαδήποτε άλλη ανάλογη αναφορά δικαιούχου για συγγραφικό δικαίωμα και κατά τρόπο τουλάχιστον τόσο εμφανή όπως αυτή η άλλη ανάλογη αναφορά δικαιούχου για συγγραφικό δικαίωμα. Για την άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, μπορείτε να χρησιμοποιήσετε τις αναφορές που απαιτούνται από αυτή τη Ρήτρα για το σκοπό της πληροφόρησης περί το δικαιούχο πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας όπως ορίζεται παραπάνω, και επιπλέον κατά την άσκηση των δικαιωμάτων Σας υπό τους όρους αυτής της Άδειας, δεν μπορείτε έμμεσα ή άμεσα να επικαλεστείτε ή εννοήσετε την ύπαρξη οποιασδήποτε σχέσης ή έγκρισης από τον Πρώτο Δημιουργό (Αρχικό Δικαιούχο) ή το Δικαιούχο Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων, τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, ή το Δικαιούχο που αφορά Εσάς ή τις χρήσεις του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης από Εσάς, χωρίς ταυτόχρονα να την αποδεικνύετε με ξεχωριστή, έγγραφη άδεια του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή του Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων, του Χορηγούντα την Άδεια ή του Δικαιούχου.
δ.
Προς άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, οι περιορισμοί που αναφέρονται παραπάνω [4(α), 4(β), 4(γ)] δεν εφαρμόζονται σ’ αυτά τα μέρη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που περιλαμβάνονται στον ορισμό «Αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης» αυτής της Άδειας αποκλειστικά επειδή συνιστούν αντικείμενο του δικαιώματος ειδικής φύσης (sui generis) του κατασκευαστή βάσης δεδομένων σύμφωνα με τον Ελληνικό νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας κατ’ εφαρμογή της Οδηγίας 96/9/ΕΟΚ.
ε.
Προς άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, γίνεται δεκτό ότι:
Υποχρεωτικές αδειοδοτήσεις μη δεκτικές παραίτησης: Στην περίπτωση υποχρεωτικών αδειοδοτήσεων στις οποίες δεν είναι δυνατή η παραίτηση (για παράδειγμα, αναφορικά με την είσπραξη αμοιβών για πνευματικά δικαιώματα) ο Χορηγών την Άδεια διατηρεί το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει τέτοιες αμοιβές είτε για εμπορική είτε για μη εμπορική χρήση του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης.
Φορείς Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων: Ο Χορηγών την Άδεια παραιτείται από το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει (είτε ατομικά είτε μέσω Οργανισμού Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων, στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι μέλος τέτοιου φορέα) αμοιβές για πνευματικά δικαιώματα αναφορικά με μη εμπορικές χρήσεις του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης. Ο Χορηγών την Άδεια διατηρεί το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει (είτε ατομικά είτε μέσω Οργανισμού Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων, στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι μέλος τέτοιου φορέα) αμοιβές για πνευματικά δικαιώματα αναφορικά με εμπορικές χρήσεις του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης.
στ.
Όλες οι εξουσίες του ηθικού δικαιώματος παραμένουν αναλλοίωτες στο βαθμό που προβλέπονται στον εφαρμοστέο νόμο και δεν είναι δεκτικές παραίτησης.

Ωστόσο, τα φυσικά ή νομικά πρόσωπα τα οποία έχουν γίνει αποδέκτες Συλλογικών Έργων από Εσάς βάσει της Άδειας αυτής, δεν θα υφίστανται τις συνέπειες της καταγγελίας της άδειάς τους, υπό τον όρο ότι αυτά τα φυσικά ή νομικά πρόσωπα θα συμμορφώνονται πλήρως με αυτές τις άδειες.

Βάσει των ανωτέρω όρων και προϋποθέσεων, η παρούσα Άδεια είναι διαρκής (για όλη τη διάρκεια της ισχύος προστασίας των πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων ή συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων επί του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης). Άσχετα με τα ανωτέρω, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια διατηρεί το δικαίωμα να παρέχει το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης υπό διαφορετικούς όρους (άδειας) ή να παύσει τη διανομή του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης οποτεδήποτε, υπό την προϋπόθεση, ωστόσο, ότι αυτή η επιλογή δεν θα χρησιμεύει στο να καταγγέλλει την Άδεια αυτή (ή άλλη άδεια η οποία χορηγήθηκε ή απαιτείται να χορηγηθεί βάσει των όρων της παρούσας Άδειας) και η Άδεια αυτή θα συνεχίσει να είναι σε πλήρη ισχύ εκτός εάν καταγγελθεί όπως αναφέρεται ανωτέρω.
8. Γενικά
α.
Κάθε φορά που διανέμετε ή παρουσιάζετε στο κοινό το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης ή ένα Συλλογικό Έργο, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια προσφέρει στον αποδέκτη μια άδεια στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης με τους ίδιους όρους και προϋποθέσεις όπως η άδεια ή οποία χορηγήθηκε σε Εσάς βάσει της παρούσας Άδειας.
β.
Αν μια διάταξη της παρούσας Άδειας είναι ανίσχυρη ή δεν είναι δυνατόν να επιβληθεί σύμφωνα με τον ισχύοντα νόμο, αυτό δεν θα θίγει την ισχύ ή την δυνατότητα να επιβληθούν οι υπόλοιποι όροι της Άδειας αυτής, και χωρίς άλλη ενέργεια από τους συμβαλλομένους στο παρόν συμφωνητικό, η διάταξη αυτή θα ανασυνταχθεί στο ελάχιστο αναγκαίο μέτρο για να καταστεί ισχυρή και επιβαλλόμενη μεταξύ των συμβαλλόμενων μερών.
γ.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE A SOLICITOR-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT, RELATED RIGHTS, SUI GENERIS DATABASE RIGHT, AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
This Licence enables You (all capitalised terms defined below) to view and Distribute the Work worldwide provided that You credit the Original Author and comply with the other terms and conditions of this Licence.
'The Licensor' (one or more natural or legal persons offering the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence)
and
'You' (the natural or legal person acquiring rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.)
agree as follows:
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole, which by reason of the selection and arrangement of its contents constitutes an intellectual creation.
"Derivative Work" means any work created by the editing, modification, adaptation or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"Original Author" means the natural or legal person or persons that created the Work.
"Performance" means (i) a performance of any actors, singers, musicians, dancers or other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works or expressions of works of folklore, which is a live performance given by one or more individuals, and shall include a performance of a variety act or any similar presentation or (ii) a broadcast or rebroadcast of the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. A performance of a literary work includes a reading or recitation and a performance of a dramatic work includes a choreographic work or a work of mime. “Perform” shall be construed accordingly.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
"Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. For the purposes of this Licence a Work shall also be taken to mean a live Performance or a database insofar as these are protected under the applicable law within Your jurisdiction.
For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number.
2. Fair Dealing Rights Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses or rights permitted under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.
3. Licence Grant Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, the Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below for the duration of copyright, related right and/or sui generis database right in the Work.
to Reproduce the Work;
to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works;
to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work;
to Distribute or Perform the Work or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work to the public in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter created.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise You have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d) and Section 6.
Where the Licensor is the owner of the sui generis database rights under national law implementing Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases, the Licensor waives these rights.
4. Restrictions The Licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence. You must make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and Collective Works Distributed or Performed by You. You may not offer or impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work that restrict the terms of this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to the recipient under the terms of the Licence. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. When You Distribute or Perform the Work, You must not impose any effective technological measures on the Work or the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Licence. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If You Distribute, or Perform the Work or any Collective Work, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilising: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; and (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this Licence, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and not waivable by applicable law.
For the avoidance of doubt: The restrictions mentioned above (4(a) to 4(c)) do not apply to those parts of the Work considered to fall within the definition of a "Work" under this Licence exclusively because they meet the criteria of the sui generis database right under national law implementing Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases.
Additional Provisions for recipients making use of the Work
5. Further licence from the Licensor
Each time You Distribute or Perform the Work, or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the relevant recipient a licence to use the Work on the same terms and conditions as the Licence granted to You hereunder.
6. Reservation of Rights
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory Licence Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence;
Waivable Compulsory Licence Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
Voluntary Licence Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).
7. Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as required by law, the Work is licensed by the Licensor on an "as is" and "as available" basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
8. Limit of Liability
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.
9. Termination
This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Natural or legal persons who have received Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such natural or legal persons remain in full compliance with those Licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this Licence.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright, related right and/or sui generis database right in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
10. General
The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this Licence is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or unenforceable.
This Licence constitutes the entire licence between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication in any form.
No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
Creative Commons Notice
Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this Licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of this Licence.

Creative Commons Codice Legale
Attribuzione – Non commerciale – Non opere derivate 3.0 Italia
 
L'ASSOCIAZIONE CREATIVE COMMONS (DI SEGUITO "CREATIVE COMMONS") NON È UNO STUDIO LEGALE E NON FORNISCE SERVIZI DI CONSULENZA LEGALE. LA DISTRIBUZIONE DI QUESTO MODELLO DI CONTRATTO DI LICENZA NON INSTAURA UN RAPPORTO AVVOCATO-CLIENTE. CREATIVE COMMONS FORNISCE INFORMAZIONI DA CONSIDERARSI "COSÌ COME SONO". CREATIVE COMMONS NON PRESTA ALCUNA GARANZIA PER LE INFORMAZIONI FORNITE E SI ESIME DA OGNI RESPONSABILITÀ PER I DANNI DERIVANTI DALL'USO DELLE STESSE.
La Licenza
L'OPERA (COME SOTTO DEFINITA) È MESSA A DISPOSIZIONE SULLA BASE DEI TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA "CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE" ("CCPL" O "LICENZA"). L'OPERA È PROTETTA DAL DIRITTO D'AUTORE, DAGLI ALTRI DIRITTI ATTRIBUITI DALLA LEGGE SUL DIRITTO D'AUTORE (DIRITTI CONNESSI, DIRITTI SULLE BANCHE DATI, ECC.) E/O DALLE ALTRE LEGGI APPLICABILI. OGNI UTILIZZAZIONE DELL'OPERA CHE NON SIA AUTORIZZATA AI SENSI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA E/O DELLE ALTRE LEGGI APPLICABILI È PROIBITA.
CON IL SEMPLICE ESERCIZIO SULL'OPERA DI UNO QUALUNQUE DEI DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI, TU ACCETTI E TI OBBLIGHI A RISPETTARE INTEGRALMENTE I TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA. IL LICENZIANTE CONCEDE A TE I DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI A CONDIZIONE CHE TU ACCETTI DI RISPETTARE I TERMINI E LE CONDIZIONI DI CUI ALLA PRESENTE LICENZA.
Art. 1 - Definizioni
Ai fini e per gli effetti della presente licenza, si intende per
"Collezione di Opere", un'opera, come un numero di un periodico, un'antologia o un'enciclopedia, nella quale l'Opera nella sua interezza e forma originale, unitamente ad altri contributi costituenti loro stessi opere distinte ed autonome, sono raccolti in un'unità collettiva. Un'opera che costituisce Collezione di Opere non verrà considerata Opera Derivata (come sotto definita) ai fini della presente Licenza;
"Opera Derivata", un'opera basata sull'Opera ovvero sull'Opera insieme con altre opere preesistenti, come una traduzione, un arrangiamento musicale, un adattamento teatrale, narrativo, cinematografico, una registrazione di suoni, una riproduzione d'arte, un digesto, una sintesi, o ogni altra forma in cui l'Opera possa essere riproposta, trasformata o adattata. Nel caso in cui un'Opera tra quelle qui descritte costituisca già Collezione di Opere, essa non sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini della presente Licenza. Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, quando l'Opera sia una composizione musicale o registrazione di suoni, la sincronizzazione dell'Opera in relazione con un'immagine in movimento ("synching") sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini di questa Licenza;
"Licenziante", l'individuo, gli individui, l'ente o gli enti che offre o offrono l'Opera secondo i termini e le condizioni della presente Licenza;
"Autore Originario", il soggetto o i soggetti che ha o hanno creato l'Opera;
"Opera", l'opera dell'ingegno o, comunque, qualsiasi bene o prestazione suscettibile di protezione in forza delle leggi sul diritto d'autore (diritto d'autore, diritti connessi, diritto sui generis sulle banche dati, ecc.), la cui utilizzazione è offerta nel rispetto dei termini della presente Licenza;
"Tu"/"Te", l'individuo o l'ente che esercita i diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza e che non abbia precedentemente violato i termini della presente Licenza relativi all'Opera o che, nonostante una precedente violazione degli stessi, abbia ricevuto espressa autorizzazione dal Licenziante all'esercizio dei diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza.
Art. 2 - Libere Utilizzazioni
La presente Licenza non intende in alcun modo ridurre, limitare o restringere alcuna utilizzazione non protetta dal diritto d'autore o alcun diritto di libera utilizzazione o l'operare della regola dell'esaurimento del diritto o altre limitazioni dei diritti sull'Opera derivanti dalle leggi applicabili.
Art. 3 - Concessione della Licenza
Nel rispetto dei termini e delle condizioni contenute nella presente Licenza, il Licenziante concede a Te una licenza per tutto il mondo, gratuita, non esclusiva e perpetua (per la durata del diritto d'autore applicabile) che autorizza ad esercitare i diritti sull'Opera qui di seguito elencati:
riproduzione dell'Opera, incorporazione dell'Opera in una o più Collezioni di Opere e riproduzione dell'Opera come incorporata nelle Collezioni di Opere;
distribuzione di copie dell'Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera è registrata, prestito di copie dell'Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale dell'Opera, e ciò anche quando l'Opera sia incorporata in Collezioni di Opere.
I diritti sopra descritti potranno essere esercitati con ogni mezzo di comunicazione e in tutti i formati. Tra i diritti di cui sopra si intende compreso il diritto di apportare all'Opera le modifiche che si rendessero tecnicamente necessarie per l'esercizio di detti diritti tramite altri mezzi di comunicazione o su altri formati. Tale diritto non riguarda la creazione di Opere Derivate, che rimane assolutamente ed esclusivamente riservata in capo al Licenziante. Tutti i diritti non espressamente concessi dal Licenziante rimangono riservati, ivi inclusi quelli di cui ai punti 4.e e 4.f. Tutti i diritti morali irrinunciabili riconosciuti dalla legge applicabile rimangono riservati.
Qualora l'Opera concessa in licenza includa una o più banche dati sulle quali il Licenziante è titolare di un diritto sui generis ai sensi delle norme nazionali di attuazione della Direttiva 96/9/CE sulle banche dati, il Licenziante rinuncia a far valere il diritto corrispondente.
Art. 4 - Restrizioni
La Licenza concessa in conformità al precedente punto 3 è espressamente assoggettata a, e limitata da, le seguenti restrizioni:
Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l'Opera, anche in forma digitale, solo alle condizioni della presente Licenza e, insieme ad ogni copia dell'Opera (o supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l'Opera) che distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi proporre o imporre alcuna condizione relativa all'Opera che restringa i termini della presente Licenza o la capacità da parte di chi riceve l'Opera di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la presente Licenza. Non puoi concedere l'Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all'esclusione delle garanzie. Quando distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico l'Opera, non puoi utilizzare alcuna misura tecnologica tale da limitare la capacità di chiunque riceva l'Opera da Te di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la presente licenza. Questo art. 4.a si applica all'Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di per sé ed indipendentemente dall'Opera stessa debba essere soggetta ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante, devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente possibile, ogni riferimento in accordo con quanto previsto dall'art. 4.c, come da richiesta.
Tu non puoi esercitare alcuno dei diritti a Te concessi al precedente punto 3 in una maniera tale che sia prevalentemente intesa o diretta al perseguimento di un vantaggio commerciale o di un compenso monetario privato. Lo scambio dell'Opera con altre opere protette dal diritto d'autore, per mezzo della condivisione di file digitali (c.d. filesharing) o altrimenti, non è considerato inteso o diretto a perseguire un vantaggio commerciale o un compenso monetario privato, a patto che non ci sia alcun pagamento di alcun compenso monetario in connessione allo scambio di opere coperte da diritto d'autore.
Qualora Tu distribuisca, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegua, reciti o esponga in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, l'Opera (come definita dal succitato art. 1) o Collezione di Opere (come definita dal succitato art. 1), a meno che sia stata avanzata una richiesta ai sensi dell'art. 4.a, devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative sul diritto d'autore sull'Opera. Devi riconoscere una menzione adeguata rispetto al mezzo di comunicazione o supporto che utilizzi: (i) all'Autore Originario citando il suo nome (o lo pseudonimo, se del caso), ove fornito; e/o (ii) alle terze parti designate, se l'Autore Originario e/o il Licenziante hanno designato una o più terze parti (ad esempio, una istituzione finanziatrice, un ente editoriale, un giornale) ("Parti Designate") perché siano citate nell'informativa sul diritto d'autore del Licenziante o nei termini di servizio o con altri mezzi ragionevoli; (iii) il titolo dell'Opera, se indicato; (iv) nella misura in cui sia ragionevolmente possibile, l'Uniform Resource Identifier, che il Licenziante specifichi dover essere associato con l'Opera, salvo che tale URI non faccia alcun riferimento alla informativa sul diritto d'autore o non dia informazioni sulla licenza dell'Opera. La menzione richiesta dal presente art. 4.c può essere realizzata in qualsiasi maniera ragionevole possibile; in ogni caso, in ipotesi di Collezione di Opere, qualora compaia una menzione di tutti i coautori della Collezione di Opere, allora essa deve essere parte di tale menzione e deve apparire con lo stesso risalto concesso alla menzione degli altri coautori. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che la menzione di cui al presente articolo ha lo scopo di riconoscere la paternità dell'Opera nei modi sopra indicati e che, esercitando i Tuoi diritti ai sensi della presente Licenza, Tu non puoi implicitamente o esplicitamente affermare o fare intendere un qualsiasi collegamento con l'Autore Originario, il Licenziante e/o le Parti Designate, o che l'Autore Originario, il Licenziante e/o le Parti Designate sponsorizzino o avallino Te o il Tuo utilizzo dell'Opera, a meno che non sussista un apposito, espresso e preventivo consenso scritto dell'Autore Originario, del Licenziante e/o delle Parti Designate.
Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che le restrizioni di cui ai precedenti punti 4.a, 4.b e 4.c non si applicano a quelle parti dell'opera che siano da considerarsi Opera ai sensi della presente Licenza solo in quanto protette dal diritto sui generis su banca dati ai sensi delle norme nazionali di attuazione della Direttiva 96/9/CE sulle banche dati.
Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, se l'Opera sia di tipo musicale:
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione o esecuzione di opere incluse in repertori. Il Licenziante si riserva il diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione o esecuzione, anche in forma digitale (ad es. tramite webcast) dell'Opera, se tale utilizzazione sia prevalentemente intesa o diretta a perseguire un vantaggio commerciale o un compenso monetario privato.
Compensi per versioni cover. Il Licenziante si riserva il diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per ogni disco che Tu crei e distribuisci a partire dall'Opera (versione cover), nel caso in cui la Tua distribuzione di detta versione cover sia prevalentemente intesa o diretta a perseguire un vantaggio commerciale o un compenso monetario privato.
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico dell'Opera mediante fonogrammi. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che se l'Opera è una registrazione di suoni, il Licenziante si riserva il diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. IMAIE), per la comunicazione al pubblico dell'Opera, anche in forma digitale, nel caso in cui la Tua comunicazione al pubblico sia prevalentemente intesa o diretta a perseguire un vantaggio commerciale o un compenso monetario privato.
Altri compensi previsti dalla legge italiana. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che il Licenziante si riserva il diritto esclusivo di riscuotere i compensi a lui attribuiti dalla legge italiana sul diritto d'autore (ad es. per l'inserimento dell'Opera in un'antologia ad uso scolastico ex art. 70 l. 633/1941), personalmente o per tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE, IMAIE), se l'utilizzazione dell'Opera sia prevalentemente intesa o diretta a perseguire un vantaggio commerciale o un compenso monetario privato. Al Licenziante spettano in ogni caso i compensi irrinunciabili a lui attribuiti dalla medesima legge (ad es. l'equo compenso spettante all'autore di opere musicali, cinematografiche, audiovisive o di sequenze di immagini in movimento nel caso di noleggio ai sensi dell'art. 18-bis l. 633/1941).
Art. 5 - Dichiarazioni, Garanzie ed Esonero da responsabilità
SALVO CHE SIA ESPRESSAMENTE CONVENUTO ALTRIMENTI PER ISCRITTO FRA LE PARTI, IL LICENZIANTE OFFRE L'OPERA IN LICENZA "COSÌ COM'È" E NON FORNISCE ALCUNA DICHIARAZIONE O GARANZIA DI QUALSIASI TIPO CON RIGUARDO ALL'OPERA, SIA ESSA ESPRESSA O IMPLICITA, DI FONTE LEGALE O DI ALTRO TIPO, ESSENDO QUINDI ESCLUSE, FRA LE ALTRE, LE GARANZIE RELATIVE AL TITOLO, ALLA COMMERCIABILITÀ, ALL'IDONEITÀ PER UN FINE SPECIFICO E ALLA NON VIOLAZIONE DI DIRITTI DI TERZI O ALLA MANCANZA DI DIFETTI LATENTI O DI ALTRO TIPO, ALL'ESATTEZZA O ALLA PRESENZA DI ERRORI, SIANO ESSI ACCERTABILI O MENO. ALCUNE GIURISDIZIONI NON CONSENTONO L'ESCLUSIONE DI GARANZIE IMPLICITE E QUINDI TALE ESCLUSIONE PUÒ NON APPLICARSI A TE.
Art. 6 - Limitazione di Responsabilità
SALVI I LIMITI STABILITI DALLA LEGGE APPLICABILE, IL LICENZIANTE NON SARÀ IN ALCUN CASO RESPONSABILE NEI TUOI CONFRONTI A QUALUNQUE TITOLO PER ALCUN TIPO DI DANNO, SIA ESSO SPECIALE, INCIDENTALE, CONSEQUENZIALE, PUNITIVO O ESEMPLARE, DERIVANTE DALLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DALL'USO DELL'OPERA, ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL LICENZIANTE SIA STATO EDOTTO SULLA POSSIBILITÀ DI TALI DANNI. NESSUNA CLAUSOLA DI QUESTA LICENZA ESCLUDE O LIMITA LA RESPONSABILITÀ NEL CASO IN CUI QUESTA DIPENDA DA DOLO O COLPA GRAVE.
Art. 7 - Risoluzione
La presente Licenza si intenderà risolta di diritto e i diritti con essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente, senza necessità di alcuna comunicazione in tal senso da parte del Licenziante, in caso di qualsivoglia inadempimento dei termini della presente Licenza da parte Tua, ed in particolare delle disposizioni di cui ai punti 4.a, 4.b e/o 4.c, essendo la presente Licenza condizionata risolutivamente al verificarsi di tali inadempimenti. In ogni caso, la risoluzione della presente Licenza non pregiudicherà i diritti acquisiti da individui o enti che abbiano acquisito da Te Collezioni di Opere, ai sensi della presente Licenza, a condizione che tali individui o enti continuino a rispettare integralmente le licenze di cui sono parte. Le sezioni 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 rimangono valide in presenza di qualsiasi risoluzione della presente Licenza.
Sempre che vengano rispettati i termini e le condizioni di cui sopra, la presente Licenza è perpetua (e concessa per tutta la durata del diritto d'autore applicabile sull'Opera). Nonostante ciò, il Licenziante si riserva il diritto di rilasciare l'Opera sulla base dei termini di una differente licenza o di cessare la distribuzione dell'Opera in qualsiasi momento; fermo restando che, in ogni caso, tali decisioni non comporteranno recesso dalla presente Licenza (o da qualsiasi altra licenza che sia stata concessa, o che sia richiesto che venga concessa, ai termini della presente Licenza), e la presente Licenza continuerà ad avere piena efficacia, salvo che vi sia risoluzione come sopra indicato.
Art. 8 - Varie
Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti pubblicamente in forma digitale l'Opera o una Collezione di Opere, il Licenziante offre al destinatario una licenza per l'Opera nei medesimi termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi tramite la presente Licenza.
L'invalidità o l'inefficacia, secondo la legge applicabile, di una o più fra le disposizioni della presente Licenza, non comporterà l'invalidità o l'inefficacia dei restanti termini e, senza bisogno di ulteriori azioni delle parti, le disposizioni invalide o inefficaci saranno da intendersi rettificate nei limiti della misura che sia indispensabile per renderle valide ed efficaci.
In nessun caso i termini e le disposizioni di cui alla presente Licenza possono essere considerati rinunciati, né alcuna violazione può essere considerata consentita, salvo che tale rinuncia o consenso risultino per iscritto da una dichiarazione firmata dalla parte contro cui operi tale rinuncia o consenso.
La presente Licenza costituisce l'intero accordo tra le parti relativamente all'Opera qui data in licenza. Non esistono altre intese, accordi o dichiarazioni relative all'Opera che non siano quelle qui specificate. Il Licenziante non sarà vincolato ad alcuna altra disposizione addizionale che possa apparire in alcuna comunicazione da Te proveniente. La presente Licenza non può essere modificata senza il mutuo consenso scritto del Licenziante e Tuo.
La presente licenza è stata redatta sulla base della legge italiana, in particolare del Codice Civile del 1942 e della legge 22 Aprile 1941, n. 633 e successive modificazioni sulla protezione del diritto d'autore e di altri diritti connessi al suo esercizio.

1. Definities
'Verzamelwerk' een werk waarin het Werk, in zijn geheel en in ongewijzigde vorm, samen met een of meer andere werken, die elk een afzonderlijk en zelfstandig werk vormen, tot een geheel is samengevoegd. Voorbeelden van een verzamelwerk zijn een tijdschrift, een bloemlezing of een encyclopedie. Een Verzamelwerk zal voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk (als hieronder omschreven) worden beschouwd.
'Afgeleid werk' een werk dat is gebaseerd op het Werk of op het Werk en andere reeds bestaande werken. Voorbeelden van een Afgeleid werk zijn een vertaling, een muziekschikking (arrangement), een toneelbewerking, een literaire bewerking, een verfilming, een geluidsopname, een kunstreproductie, een verkorte versie, een samenvatting of enig andere bewerking van het Werk, met dien verstande dat een Verzamelwerk voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk zal worden beschouwd. Indien het Werk een muziekwerk betreft, zal de synchronisatie van de tijdslijnen van het Werk en een bewegend beeld ('synching') voor de toepassing van deze Licentie als een Afgeleid Werk worden beschouwd.
'Licentiegever' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/rechtspersonen die het Werk volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie aanbiedt/aanbieden.
'Maker' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/personen die het oorspronkelijke werk gemaakt heeft/hebben. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder de Maker mede verstaan de uitvoerende kunstenaar, film- en fonogramproducent en omroeporganisaties in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de producent van een databank in de zin van de Databankenwet.
'Werk' het auteursrechtelijk beschermde werk dat volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie wordt aangeboden. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder het Werk mede verstaan het fonogram, de eerste vastlegging van een film en het (omroep)programma in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de databank in de zin van de Databankenwet, voor zover dit fonogram, deze eerste vastlegging van een film, dit (omroep)programma en deze databank beschermd wordt krachtens de toepasselijke wet in de jurisdictie van de Gebruiker.
'Gebruiker' de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon die rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uitoefent en die de voorwaarden van deze Licentie met betrekking tot het Werk niet eerder geschonden heeft, of die van de Licentiegever uitdrukkelijke toestemming gekregen heeft om rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uit te oefenen ondanks een eerdere schending.
2. Beperkingen van de uitsluitende rechten. Niets in deze Licentie strekt ertoe om de rechten te beperken die voortvloeien uit de beperkingen en uitputting van de uitsluitende rechten van de rechthebbende krachtens het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het databankenrecht of enige andere toepasselijke rechten.
3. Licentieverlening. Met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie verleent de Licentiegever hierbij aan de Gebruiker een wereldwijde, niet-exclusieve licentie om de navolgende rechten met betrekking tot het Werk vrij van royalty's uit te oefenen voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten:
het reproduceren van het Werk, het opnemen van het Werk in een of meerdere Verzamelwerken, en het reproduceren van het in de Verzamelwerken opgenomen Werk;
het verspreiden van exemplaren van het Werk, het in het openbaar tonen, op- en uitvoeren en het on-line beschikbaar stellen van het Werk, afzonderlijk en als deel van een Verzamelwerk;
het opvragen en hergebruiken van het Werk;
De Gebruiker mag deze rechten uitoefenen met behulp van alle thans bekende media, dragers en formats. De Gebruiker is tevens gerechtigd om technische wijzigingen aan te brengen die noodzakelijk zijn om de rechten met behulp van andere media, dragers en formats uit te oefenen, maar is verder niet gerechtigd om Afgeleide Werken te maken. Alle niet uitdrukkelijk verleende rechten zijn hierbij voorbehouden aan de Licentiegever, met inbegrip van maar niet beperkt tot de rechten die in de artikelen 4(e) en 4(f) worden genoemd. Voor zover de Licentiegever op basis van het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn over uitsluitende rechten beschickt doet de Licentiegever afstand van deze rechten.
4. Beperkingen. De in artikel 3 verleende Licentie is uitdrukkelijk gebonden aan de volgende beperkingen:
De Gebruiker mag het Werk uitsluitend verspreiden, in het openbaar tonen, op- of on-line beschikbaar stellen met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie, en de Gebruiker dient een exemplaar van, of de Uniform Resource Identifier voor, deze Licentie toe te voegen aan elk exemplaar van het Werk dat de Gebruiker verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert, of on-line beschikbaar stelt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk onder enige afwijkende voorwaarden aan te bieden waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk in sublicentie te geven. De Gebruiker dient alle vermeldingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie dan wel naar de uitsluiting van garantie te laten staan. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk te verspreiden, in het openbaar te tonen, op- of uit te voeren of on-line beschikbaar te stellen met toepassing van technologische voorzieningen waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het voorgaande is tevens van toepassing op het Werk dat deel uitmaakt van een Verzamelwerk, maar dat houdt niet in dat het Verzamelwerk, afgezien van het Werk zelf, gebonden is aan de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. Indien de Gebruiker een Verzamelwerk maakt, dient deze, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, de op grond van artikel 4(c) vereiste naamsvermelding uit het Verzamelwerk te verwijderen, voor zover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek.
Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om de krachtens artikel 3 aan de Gebruiker verleende rechten uit te oefenen op een wijze die in de eerste plaats is bedoeld voor of is gericht op zakelijk of persoonlijk financieel gewin. De uitwisseling van het Werk in ruil voor andere door intellectuele eigendomsrechten beschermde werken door het delen van digitale bestanden (file-sharing) of anderszins zal niet worden beschouwd als zijnde bedoeld voor of gericht op zakelijk of persoonlijk financieel gewin, met dien verstande dat er geen betaling of andersoortige financiële vergoeding plaatsvindt in verband met de uitwisseling van de door intellectuele eigendomsrechten beschermde werken.
Indien de Gebruiker het Werk of Verzamelwerken verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert of on-line beschikbaar stelt, dient de Gebruiker, tenzij er sprake is van een verzoek als vermeld in lid 4(a), alle auteursrechtvermeldingen met betrekking tot het Werk te laten staan. Tevens dient de Gebruiker, op een wijze die redelijk is in verhouding tot het gebruikte medium, de naam te vermelden van (i) de Maker(of zijn/haar pseudoniem indien van toepassing) indien deze wordt vermeld; en/of (ii) van (een) andere partij(en) (b.v. sponsor, uitgeverij, tijdschrift) indien de naamsvermelding van deze partij(en) ("Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden") in de auteursrechtvermelding of algemene voorwaarden van de Licentiegever of op een andere redelijke wijze verplicht is gesteld door de Maker en/of de Licentiegever; de titel van het Werk indien deze wordt vermeld; voorzover redelijkerwijs toepasbaar de Uniform Resource Identifier, indien aanwezig, waarvan de Licentiegever heeft aangegeven dat deze bij het Werk hoort, tenzij de URI niet verwijst naar de auteursrechtvermeldingen of de licentie-informatie betreffende het Werk. De Gebruiker dient op redelijke wijze aan de in dit artikel genoemde vereisten te voldoen; echter, met dien verstande dat, in geval van een Verzamelwerk, de naamsvermeldingen in ieder geval geplaatst dienen te worden, indien er een naamsvermelding van alle makers van het Verzamelwerk geplaatst wordt dan als deel van die naamsvermeldingen, en op een wijze die in ieder geval even duidelijk is als de naamsvermeldingen van de overige makers. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat de Gebruiker uitsluitend gebruik mag maken van de naamsvermelding op de in dit artikel omschreven wijze teneinde te voldoen aan de naamsvermeldingsverplichting en, door gebruikmaking van zijn rechten krachtens deze Licentie, is het de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om op enigerlei wijze de indruk te wekken dat er sprake is van enig verband met, sponsorschap van of goedkeuring van de (toepasselijke) Maker, Licentiegever c.q. Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden van de Gebruiker of diens gebruik van het Werk, zonder de afzonderlijke, uitdrukkelijke, voorafgaande, schriftelijke toestemming van de Maker, Licentiegever c.q. Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden.
Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld, dat de hierboven vermelde beperkingen (lid 4(a), lid 4(b) en lid 4(c)) niet van toepassing zijn op die onderdelen van het Werk die geacht worden te vallen onder de definitie van het 'Werk' zoals vermeld in deze Licentie uitsluitend omdat zij voldoen aan de criteria van het sui generis databankenrecht krachtens het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn.
Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat:
Niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen. In het geval van niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot thuiskopieën) de Licentiegever zich het recht voorbehoudt om dergelijke heffingen te innen (al dan niet door middel van een auteursrechtenorganisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk;
Voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen. In het geval van voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot leenrechten) de Licentiegever zich het recht voorbehoudt om dergelijke heffingen te innen (al dan niet door middel van een auteursrechtenorganisatie) bij commercieel gebruik van het Werk. De Licentiegever doet daarentegen afstand van het recht om dergelijke heffingen te innen (al dan niet door middel van een auteursrechten organisatie) bij niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk;
Collectief rechtenbeheer. De Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om vergoedingen te innen (zelfstandig of, indien de Licentiegever lid is van een auteursrechtenorganisatie, door middel van die organisatie) bij niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk. De Licentiegever behoudt zich het recht voor om vergoedingen te innen (zelfstandig of, indien de Licentiegever lid is van een auteursrechtenorganisatie, door middel van die organisatie) bij commercieel gebruik van het Werk.
De in artikel 3 verleende rechten moeten worden uitgeoefend met inachtneming van het morele recht van de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) om zich te verzetten tegen elke misvorming, verminking of andere aantasting van het werk, welke nadeel zou kunnen toebrengen aan de eer of de naam van de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) of aan zijn waarde in deze hoedanigheid, indien en voor zover de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) op grond van een op hem van toepassing zijnde wettelijke bepaling geen afstand kan doen van dat morele recht.
5. Garantie en vrijwaring.
TENZIJ ANDERS SCHRIFTELIJK IS OVEREENGEKOMEN DOOR DE PARTIJEN, STELT DE LICENTIEGEVER HET WERK BESCHIKBAAR OP 'AS-IS' BASIS, ZONDER ENIGE GARANTIE, HETZIJ DIRECT, INDIRECT OF ANDERSZINS, MET BETREKKING TOT HET WERK, MET INBEGRIP VAN, MAAR NIET BEPERKT TOT GARANTIES MET BETREKKING TOT DE EIGENDOMSTITEL, DE VERKOOPBAARHEID, DE GESCHIKTHEID VOOR BEPAALDE DOELEINDEN, MOGELIJKE INBREUK, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN LATENTE OF ANDERE TEKORTKOMINGEN, DE JUISTHEID OF DE AAN- OF AFWEZIGHEID VAN FOUTEN, ONGEACHT DE OPSPOORBAARHEID DAARVAN, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT.
6. Beperking van de aansprakelijkheid.
DE LICENTIEGEVER AANVAARDT GEEN ENKELE AANSPRAKELIJKHEID JEGENS DE GEBRUIKER VOOR ENIGE BIJZONDERE OF INCIDENTELE SCHADE OF GEVOLGSCHADE VOORTVLOEIEND UIT DEZE LICENTIE OF HET GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK, ZELFS NIET INDIEN DE LICENTIEGEVER OP DE HOOGTE IS GESTELD VAN HET RISICO VAN DERGELIJKE SCHADE, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT.
7. Beëindiging
Deze Licentie en de daarin verleende rechten vervallen automatisch op het moment dat de Gebruiker in strijd handelt met de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. De licenties van natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die Verzamelwerken hebben ontvangen van de Gebruiker krachtens deze Licentie blijven echter in stand zolang dergelijke natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen zich houden aan de voorwaarden van die licenties. Na de beëindiging van deze Licentie blijven artikelen 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 en 8 onverminderd van kracht.
Met inachtneming van de hierboven vermelde voorwaarden wordt de Licentie verleend voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten op het Werk. De Licentiegever behoudt zich desalniettemin te allen tijde het recht voor om het Werk volgens gewijzigde licentievoorwaarden te verspreiden of om het Werk niet langer te verspreiden; met dien verstande dat een dergelijk besluit niet de intrekking van deze Licentie (of enig andere licentie die volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie (verplicht) is verleend) tot gevolg heeft, en deze Licentie onverminderd van kracht blijft tenzij zij op de in lid a omschreven wijze wordt beëindigd.
8. Diversen
Elke keer dat de Gebruiker het Werk of een Verzamelwerk verspreidt of on-line beschikbaar stelt, biedt de Licentiegever de ontvanger een licentie op het Werk aan volgens de algemene voorwaarden van deze Licentie.
Indien enige bepaling van deze Licentie nietig of niet rechtens afdwingbaar is, zullen de overige voorwaarden van deze Licentie volledig van kracht blijven. De nietige of niet-afdwingbare bepaling zal, zonder tussenkomst van de partijen, worden vervangen door een geldige en afdwingbare bepaling waarbij het doel en de strekking van de oorspronkelijke bepaling zoveel mogelijk in acht worden genomen.
Een verklaring van afstand van in deze Licentie verleende rechten of een wijziging van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dient schriftelijk te geschieden en getekend te zijn door de partij die verantwoordelijk is voor de verklaring van afstand respectievelijk de partij wiens toestemming voor de wijziging is vereist.
Deze Licentie bevat de volledige overeenkomst tussen de partijen met betrekking tot het in licentie gegeven Werk. Er zijn geen andere afspraken gemaakt met betrekking tot het Werk. De Licentiegever is niet gebonden aan enige aanvullende bepalingen die worden vermeld in mededelingen van de Gebruiker. Deze licentie kan uitsluitend worden gewijzigd met de wederzijdse, schriftelijke instemming van de Licentiegever en de Gebruiker.
Aansprakelijkheid en merkrechten van Creative Commons
Creative Commons is geen partij bij deze Licentie en stelt geen enkele garantie met betrekking tot het Werk. Creative Commons kan op geen enkele wijze aansprakelijk worden gehouden jegens de Gebruiker of derden voor enigerlei schade met inbegrip van, maar niet beperkt tot enige algemene, bijzondere, incidentele of gevolgschade voortvloeiend uit deze Licentie. Onverminderd het bepaalde in de twee (2) voorgaande volzinnen is Creative Commons gebonden aan alle rechten en verplichtingen van de Licentiegever indien Creative Commons zichzelf uitdrukkelijk kenbaar gemaakt heeft als de Licentiegever krachtens deze Licentie.
Met uitzondering van het beperkte doel om iedereen erop te wijzen dat het Werk in licentie is gegeven krachtens de CCPL, geeft Creative Commons aan geen van de partijen toestemming om gebruik te maken van de merknaam 'Creative Commons', enige daarmee verband houdende merknamen dan wel het logo van Creative Commons gebruiken zonder de voorafgaande schriftelijke toestemming van Creative Commons. Het geoorloofde gebruik dient in overeenstemming te zijn met de alsdan geldende richtlijnen betreffende het gebruik van merknamen van Creative Commons zoals die bekend worden gemaakt op de website of anderszins van tijd tot tijd, desgevraagd, ter beschikking worden gesteld. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat deze merkrechtelijke beperking geen deel uitmaakt van de Licentie.

3. Concessão da Licença. O Licenciante concede ao Utilizador uma licença de âmbito mundial, gratuita, não exclusiva, pelo período de duração do direito de autor ou direito conexo aplicável, sujeita aos termos e condições da presente LPCC, para o exercício dos seguintes direitos de exploração:
Reproduzir o Trabalho, incorporar o Trabalho numa ou mais Coleções, Reproduzir o Trabalho quando incorporado em Coleções; e,
Distribuir e Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho, incluindo quando incorporado em Coleções.
Os direitos acima referidos podem ser exercidos em todos os meios e formatos, tangíveis ou intangíveis, independente de serem conhecidos agora ou concebidos posteriormente. Os direitos acima referidos incluem o direito de fazer as modificações que forem tecnicamente necessárias para exercer os direitos noutros meios e formatos, mas não o direito de transformar o Trabalho para criar Trabalhos Derivados. Todos os direitos que não tenham sido expressamente concedidos pelo Licenciante ficam assim reservados, incluindo, nomeadamente, os direitos estabelecidos nas Secções 4(e) e 4(f). Caso o Licenciante seja titular dos direitos exclusivos previstos no Capítulo III do Decreto-Lei n.º 122/2000 de 4 de Julho, que implementou para a ordem jurídica portuguesa a Diretiva n.º 96/9/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 11 de Março, relativa à proteção jurídica de bases de dados, declara expressamente renunciar a esses direitos.
4. Restrições. A licença concedida na Secção 3 supra está expressamente sujeita e limitada pelas seguintes restrições:
O Utilizador apenas pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho sob os termos desta Licença. O Utilizador deve incluir, em cada cópia do Trabalho que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, uma cópia desta Licença ou o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI). O Utilizador não pode propor ou impor quaisquer termos que alterem ou restrinjam os termos desta Licença ou o exercício, por parte do destinatário, dos direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. O Utilizador não pode sub-licenciar o Trabalho. O Utilizador deve manter intactas, em cada cópia do Trabalho que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, todos os avisos que se referem a esta Licença e à exclusão de garantias. O Utilizador não pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público nenhuma cópia do Trabalho com qualquer medida tecnológica que restrinja a possibilidade do destinatário exercer os direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. Esta Secção 4(a) aplica-se ao Trabalho quando incorporado em Coleções, mas isto não requer que a Coleção, independente do próprio Trabalho, esteja sujeita aos termos desta Licença. Se o Utilizador criar uma Coleção e for notificado pelo Licenciante para remover da Coleção qualquer crédito inserido em conformidade com o estipulado na Secção 4(c), deve, na medida do razoável, agir de acordo com o solicitado.
O Utilizador não poderá exercer nenhum dos direitos concedidos na Secção 3 de nenhum modo que tenha como objetivo principal ou que seja direcionado para a obtenção de uma vantagem comercial ou compensação monetária. A troca do Trabalho por outros trabalhos protegidos por direito de autor ou por direitos conexos, através da partilha digital de ficheiros ou por qualquer outro meio, não deverá ser considerada como intencionada ou dirigida à obtenção de uma vantagem comercial ou compensação monetária, se não houver lugar ao pagamento de qualquer compensação monetária relativamente à troca de trabalhos protegidos por direito de autor ou direitos conexos.
Se o Utilizador Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho ou qualquer Coleção, deve – a menos que o Licenciante o tenha notificado em sentido contrário nos termos da Secção 4(a) parte final – manter intactos todos os avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, e exibir, de forma razoável em relação ao meio ou meios por si empregues: (i) o nome ou o pseudónimo, se fornecidos, do Titular Originário, nos avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, nos termos de serviço ou através de outros meios razoáveis; e/ou (ii) o nome da parte ou partes (por exemplo, um instituto, uma editora, uma revista) que o Titular Originário e/ou o Licenciante tiverem designado para atribuição (“Partes de Atribuição”), nos avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, nos termos de serviço ou através de outros meios razoáveis; e (iii) o título do Trabalho, se fornecido; e (iv) o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante tenha especificado para estar associado ao Trabalho, se o houver, exceto se o URI não disser respeito ao aviso referente ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento do Trabalho. Os créditos exigidos por esta Secção 4(c) podem ser implementados de qualquer forma, desde que razoável. No caso de uma Coleção, exibindo-se os créditos de todos os autores participantes da Coleção, os créditos ora exigidos devem fazer parte daqueles e devem aparecer de modo pelo menos tão proeminente quanto os créditos dados aos demais autores participantes. De modo a evitar dúvidas, o Utilizador apenas poderá fazer uso dos créditos exigidos por esta Secção 4(c) para o propósito de atribuição na forma estabelecida acima. Ao exercer os seus direitos sob esta Licença, o Utilizador não poderá implícita ou explicitamente afirmar ou sugerir qualquer vínculo, patrocínio ou apoio do Titular Originário, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição a si ou ao seu uso do Trabalho, a menos que tenha obtido prévia e expressamente autorização daqueles.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se que as restrições acima mencionadas [4(a), 4(b) e 4(c)] não se aplicam àquelas partes do Trabalho que apenas sejam protegidas pelo direito especial do fabricante de base de dados previsto no art. 12.º do Decreto-Lei n.º 122/2000 de 4 de Julho, que implementou para a ordem jurídica portuguesa a Diretiva n.º 96/9/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 11 de Março, relativa à proteção jurídica de bases de dados.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se o seguinte:
Representação institucional obrigatória irrenunciável. Quando o direito de cobrar uma compensação monetária ou remuneração equitativa esteja sujeito a representação institucional obrigatória e seja, ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, irrenunciável, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito exclusivo de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração por qualquer exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença; e
Representação institucional obrigatória renunciável. Quando o direito de cobrar uma compensação monetária ou remuneração equitativa esteja sujeito a representação institucional obrigatória e seja, ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, renunciável, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito exclusivo de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração por qualquer exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença que seja para um propósito ou uso comercial, em consonância com a Secção 4(b), e renuncia ao direito exclusivo de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração por qualquer outro exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença; e
Representação voluntária. Quando o direito de cobrar uma compensação monetária ou remuneração equitativa esteja sujeito a representação voluntária, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração, quer individualmente quer – na hipótese de o Licenciante ser membro de uma sociedade de gestão coletiva de direitos (por exemplo, SPA, GDA, AUDIOGEST) – por intermédio dessa sociedade, por qualquer exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença que seja para um propósito ou uso comercial, em consonância com a Secção 4(b).
Nada nesta Licença poderá afetar quaisquer dos direitos morais assegurados ao Autor ou ao Artista pela Legislação Aplicável, incluindo, sem limitação, o direito de oposição a toda e qualquer mutilação, deformação ou outra modificação do Trabalho e, de um modo geral, a todo e qualquer ato que a desvirtue e possa afetar a honra e reputação do Autor ou do Artista.
5. Declarações, Garantias e Exoneração
EXCETO QUANDO EXPRESSAMENTE ACORDADO PELAS PARTES POR ESCRITO EM SENTIDO CONTRÁRIO E NA MEDIDA PERMITIDA PELA LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL, O LICENCIANTE DISPONIBILIZA O TRABALHO “NO ESTADO EM QUE SE ENCONTRA” (“AS-IS BASIS”), E NÃO FAZ QUAISQUER DECLARAÇÕES OU PRESTA GARANTIAS DE QUALQUER TIPO EM RELAÇÃO AO TRABALHO, SEJAM EXPRESSAS OU IMPLÍCITAS, LEGAIS OU OUTRAS, INCLUINDO, SEM LIMITAÇÃO, QUAISQUER GARANTIAS SOBRE A TITULARIDADE DO TRABALHO, POTENCIALIDADE COMERCIAL, ADEQUAÇÃO A UM FIM ESPECÍFICO, LEGALIDADE, AUSÊNCIA DE DEFEITOS LATENTES OU OUTROS, EXATIDÃO, EXISTÊNCIA OU AUSÊNCIA DE ERROS, SEJAM ELES APARENTES OU OCULTOS. ALGUMAS JURISDIÇÕES NÃO ADMITEM A EXCLUSÃO DE GARANTIAS IMPLÍCITAS, PELO QUE TAL EXCLUSÃO PODERÁ NÃO SER APLICÁVEL AO UTILIZADOR.
6. Limitação de Responsabilidade. EXCETO NA EXTENSÃO EXIGIDA PELA LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL, EM NENHUMA CIRCUNSTÂNCIA O LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PARA COM O UTILIZADOR, COM BASE EM NENHUMA TEORIA JURÍDICA, POR QUAISQUER DANOS, GERAIS OU ESPECIAIS (INCLUINDO DANOS EMERGENTES E LUCROS CESSANTES), INCIDENTAIS OU CONSEQUENCIAIS, PUNITIVOS OU EXEMPLARES, QUE RESULTEM DA PRESENTE LICENÇA OU DA UTILIZAÇÃO DO TRABALHO, AINDA QUE O LICENCIANTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO SOBRE A POSSIBILIDADE DE OCORRÊNCIA DE TAIS DANOS.
7. Cessação
A presente Licença e os direitos concedidos pela mesma cessarão automaticamente em caso de qualquer violação dos termos desta Licença pelo Utilizador. Os indivíduos ou entidades que tenham recebido do Utilizador Coleções sob esta Licença, não terão, no entanto, as suas licenças cessadas, se permanecerem em total cumprimento com os termos dessas licenças. As Secções 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 subsistirão a qualquer cessação desta Licença.
Sujeita aos termos e condições acima expostos, a presente Licença é válida pelo período de duração do direito de autor ou do direito conexo aplicável ao Trabalho previsto na Legislação Aplicável. Sem prejuízo do disposto na frase anterior, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito de divulgar ou publicar o Trabalho sob termos e condições de licenciamento diferentes dos da presente Licença, ou de deixar, a qualquer momento, de Distribuir o Trabalho; desde que, no entanto, quaisquer dessas ações não sirva como meio de fazer cessar esta Licença (ou qualquer outra licença que tenha sido ou que deva ser concedida sob os termos desta Licença), a qual continuará plenamente válida e eficaz, a não ser que seja terminada de acordo com o acima disposto.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se que nada no disposto nas Secções 7(a) 7(b) poderá afetar o direito moral de retirada de circulação da obra literária ou artística assegurado ao Autor pela Legislação Aplicável, o qual só poderá, no entanto, ser exercido sob os termos e condições previstos nessa Legislação.
8. Outras Disposições
Cada vez que o Utilizador distribua ou apresente ao público o Trabalho, ou uma Coleção, o Licenciante concederá ao destinatário uma licença de utilização do Trabalho objeto desta Licença com os mesmos termos e condições que foram concedidos ao Utilizador sob a presente Licença.
Caso alguma disposição desta Licença seja tida como inválida ou não executória ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, tal não afetará a validade ou a possibilidade de execução dos restantes termos desta Licença e, sem necessidade de qualquer ação adicional das partes deste acordo, tal disposição será alterada na medida necessária para que se torne válida e executável.
Nenhum termo ou disposição desta Licença será considerado renunciado e nenhuma violação será considerada consentida, a não ser que tal renúncia ou consentimento seja feito por escrito e assinado pela parte que seja afetada por tal renúncia ou consentimento.
Esta Licença representa o acordo integral entre as partes relativamente ao Trabalho objeto desta Licença. Não existem entendimentos, acordos ou declarações relativos ao Trabalho que não estejam aqui especificados. O Licenciante não será obrigado por nenhuma disposição adicional que possa resultar de qualquer comunicação proveniente do Utilizador.

Organizaţia Creative Commons (denumită în continuare „Creative Commons”) nu este o firmă de avocatură şi nu acordă servicii de asistenţă juridică. Distribuirea acestei licenţe nu creează o relaţie de tip Avocat-Client. Creative Commons oferă această formă de licenţă, aşa cum este aceasta prezentată în cele ce urmează. Creative Commons nu îşi asumă răspunderea pentru daunele rezultate din conţinutul sau utilizarea acestei licenţe.
Licenţa
Opera (aşa cum este definită mai jos) este furnizată în condiţiile acestei Licenţe Publice Creative Commons (denumită în continuare „LPCC” sau „licenţă”). Opera este protejată de legea privind drepturile de autor şi drepturile conexe şi de celelalte norme de drept aplicabile. Orice utilizare a Operei în afara celei autorizate prin această licenţă sau prin legislaţia în vigoare este interzisă.
Exercitarea oricăror drepturi prevăzute de prezenta licenţă asupra Operei presupune acceptarea licenţei. Conform termenilor şi obligaţiilor din prezenta licenţă, în măsura în care prezenta licenţă poate fi considerată un contract, Licenţiatorul propune Licenţiatului exercitarea drepturilor menţionate mai jos, iar Licenţiatul este de acord cu termenii şi condiţiile licenţei.
1. Definiţii
"Opera" desemnează opera originală de creaţie intelectuală susceptibilă de protecţie prin dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe, furnizată în condiţiile prezenţei licenţe. În cadrul acestei licenţe, prin Operă se înţelege şi o fonogramă (culegere de opere fixate pe fonogramă), o videogramă (culegere de opere fixate pe o videogramă), un program de radiodifuziune ori de televiziune, precum şi o bază de date în conformitate cu definiţiile din legislaţia în vigoare privind drepturile de autor şi drepturile conexe, cu condiţia ca o asemenea fonogramă, videogramă, program de radiodifuziune ori de televiziune sau bază de date să fie protejate de legea aplicabilă.
"Adaptare" desemnează o Operă creată pe baza unei alte Opere sau pe baza unei Opere şi a unor alte Opere preexistente, aşa cum sunt traducerile, adaptările, operele derivate, aranjamentele muzicale sau alte alterări ale unor opere literare sau artistice sau ale unor fonograme sau comunicări publice, incluzând adaptările cinematografice sau orice alte adaptări prin care Opera poate fi modificată, transformată sau adaptată, incluzând, în orice formă, părţi uşor de recunoscut ale originalului. Fac excepţie Colecţiile, care nu vor fi considerate Adaptări potrivit scopului prezentei licenţe. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, atunci când Opera este o creaţie muzicală, interpretare muzicală sau fonogramă, sincronizarea acesteia în relaţie temporală cu o imagine aflată în mişcare ("sincronizare") va fi considerată Adaptare potrivit prezentei licenţe.

Acestea, prin selecţia şi aranjamentul conţinutului lor, constituie creaţii intelectuale în care o Operă este inclusă în integralitatea ei în noua Operă, alături de una sau mai multe contribuţii, fiecare reprezentând Opere separate şi independente, care împreună dobândesc o formă colectivă. În sensul acestui contract, o Operă care constituie o Colecţie nu va fi considerată Adaptare.
"Autorul" desemnează, în cazul unei Opere literare sau artistice, persoana sau persoanele fizice care au creat Opera.
"Titularul de drepturi conexe" desemnează persoana fizică sau juridică, titular de drepturi conexe dreptului de autor, care poate fi: (i) artisti interpret sau executant, în cazul execuţiei sau interpretării; (ii) producător de înregistrări sonore şi de înregistrări audiovizuale, în cazul unei fonograme sau respectiv videograme; sau (iii) organism de radiodifuziune şi televiziune, în cazul programelor de radiodifuziune şi televiziune. În cadrul acestei licenţe, prin titular de drepturi conexe se va înţelege şi fabricantul unei baze de date.
"Licenţiatorul" desemnează persoana sau persoanele fizice şi/sau juridice care pun la dispoziţie Opera, în condiţiile prezentei licenţe.
"Licenţiatul" desemnează persoana fizică şi/sau persoana juridică care acceptă prezenta licenţă şi exercită drepturile acordate, fără să fi încălcat în prealabil termenii licenţei, sau care a primit permisiunea expresă a Licenţiatorului de a exercita drepturile conferite prin prezenta licenţă, în pofida unei încălcări anterioare a prevederilor acesteia.
"Comunicare publică" desemnează orice comunicare a unei Opere, realizată direct sau prin orice mijloace tehnice, făcută într-un loc accesibil publicului sau în orice loc în care se adună un număr de persoane care depăşeşte cercul normal al membrilor unei familii şi al cunoştinţelor acesteia, inclusiv reprezentarea scenică, recitarea sau orice altă modalitate publică de execuţie ori de prezentare directă a Operei, expunerea publică a Operelor de artă plastică, de artă aplicată, fotografică şi de arhitectură, proiecţia publică a Operelor cinematografice şi a altor Opere audiovizuale, inclusiv a Operelor de artă digitală, prezentarea într-un loc public, prin intermediul înregistrărilor sonore sau audiovizuale, precum şi prezentarea într-un loc public, prin intermediul oricăror mijloace, a unei Opere radiodifuzate. De asemenea, se consideră publică orice comunicare a unei Opere, prin mijloace cu fir sau fără fir, realizată prin punerea la dispoziţia publicului, inclusiv prin Internet sau alte reţele de calculatoare, astfel încât oricare dintre membrii publicului să poată avea acces la aceasta din orice loc sau în orice moment ales în mod individual.
"Distribuire" desemnează orice mod de transmitere a originalului sau a copiilor unei Opere sau Adaptări, precum şi oferirea publică a acestora.
"Reproducere" desemnează realizarea, integrală sau parţială, a uneia ori a mai multor copii ale unei Opere, direct sau indirect, temporar ori permanent, prin orice mijloc şi sub orice formă, inclusiv realizarea oricărei înregistrări sonore sau audiovizuale a unei Opere, precum şi stocarea permanentă ori temporară a acesteia prin mijloace electronice.
"Opţiunile licenţei" desemnează următoarele atribute importante ale licenţei, aşa cum au fost acestea selectate de către Licenţiator şi cum sunt indicate în titlul prezentei licenţe: Atribuire — Necomercial–Fără Modificări.
2. Limitele exercitării dreptului de autor. Nicio prevedere a acestei licenţe nu are scopul de a reduce, de a limita sau de a restrânge drepturile rezultate din aplicarea normelor legale cu privire la limitele exercitării dreptului de autor prevăzute de legislaţia privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe sau de alte legi aplicabile.
3. Autorizare. În condiţiile definite prin prezenta licenţă şi pe întreaga durată de protecţie a Operei prevăzută de legislaţia privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe, Licenţiatorul acordă Licenţiatului în mod neexclusiv, nelimitat teritorial şi cu titlu gratuit autorizarea de a exercita următoarele drepturi:
dreptul de a reproduce Opera, de a o încorpora într-una sau mai multe Colecţii şi de a reproduce Opera aşa cum a fost aceastaîncorporată într-o Colecţie;
dreptul de a distribui şi comunica public Opera, inclusiv încorporată în Colecţii;
în cazul în care opera este o bază de date, dreptul de a extrage şi/sau a reutiliza părţi substanţiale din Operă.
Drepturile menţionate mai sus pot fi exercitate în cazul tuturor mediilor de stocare şi formatelor cunoscute. Drepturile menţionate mai sus includ şi dreptul de a face modificările tehnice corespunzătoare necesare exercitării acestora în cazul altor medii de stocare sau formate. Toate drepturile care nu sunt expres acordate de Licenţiator sau asupra cărora Licenţiatorul nu are dreptul de gestiune rămân rezervate, în special în cazurile de gestiune colectivă obligatorie aplicabile menţionate la articolul 4 litera (e). Daca Licenţiatorul este titularul drepturilor sui-generis asupra unei baze de date, în conformitate cu legea naţională care implementează Directiva Europeană privind Bazele de Date, Licenţiatorul va renunţa la aceste drepturi.
4. Restricţii. Licenţa, acordată în conformitate cu articolul 3, se încheie sub condiţia respectării următoarelor restricţii:
Licenţiatul poate distribui sau comunica public Opera numai în condiţiile prezentei licenţe. Licenţiatul este obligat să includă o copie a licenţei sau adresa acesteia pe Internet (U.R.I. - Uniform Resource Identifier) împreună cu fiecare copie a Operei care este distribuită sau comunicată public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a oferi sau impune nicio condiţie asupra Operei, care să modifice sau să restricţioneze prevederile acestei licenţe sau exercitarea drepturilor terţilor dobânditori, aşa cum sunt acestea prevăzute în prezenta licenţă. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a sublicenţia Opera. Licenţiatul este obligat să păstreze intacte toate notificările care se referă la prezenta licenţă şi la exonerarea de răspundere din fiecare copie a Operei pe care o distribuie sau comunică public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a distribui sau de a comunica public Opera folosind măsuri tehnice de protecţie care restrâng posibilitatea terţilor dobânditori de a-şi exercita drepturile obţinute în condiţiile prezentei licenţe. Prezenta literă (a) se aplică Operei încorporate într-o Colecţie, dar nu se extinde în mod obligatoriu asupra celorlalte Opere conţinute în Colecţie. Dacă Licenţiatul creează o Colecţie, acesta este obligat, la notificarea oricărui Licenţiator, în măsura în care este posibil, să înlăture din Colecţie orice referinţă la respectivul Licenţiator, la Titularul de drepturi conexe sau la Autorul Operei, astfel cum se specifică la articolul 4 litera (c).
Licenţiatul nu poate exercita niciunul dintre drepturile acordate prin articolul 3 cu intenţia directa sau scopul de a obţine un avantaj sau profit comercial sau o compensaţie financiară personală. Schimbul Operei cu alte Opere, care sunt protejate de drepturi de autor sau drepturi conexe, prin partajarea electronică de fişiere („file-sharing”) sau prin orice alte mijloace, nu va fi considerat schimb cu intenţia sau scopul de a obţine un avantaj sau profit comercial sau o compensaţie financiară personală, cu condiţia să nu existe niciun fel de plată în legătură cu schimbul de Opere protejate de dreptul de autor sau drepturile conexe.
În cazul în care Licenţiatul distribuie sau comunică public Opera sau Colecţiile, Licenţiatul este obligat, cu excepţia cererilor făcute în baza articolului 4 litera (a), să păstreze intacte toate informaţiile sau notificările privind drepturile de autor sau conexe asupra Operei şi să furnizeze următoarele informaţii, în funcţie de mediul sau mijloacele utilizate: (i) numele Autorului şi/sau al Titularului de drepturi conexe (sau pseudonimul, după caz), dacă acesta a fost adus la cunoştinţă, şi/sau numele părţii desemnate de Autor, Titular de Drepturi Conexe şi/sau de Licenţiator pentru atribuirea Operei, în notificările Licenţiatorului privind drepturile de autor, condiţiile de utilizare sau alte menţiuni disponibile; (ii) titlul Operei, dacă este furnizat; şi (iii) în măsura în care este posibil şi dacă există, adresa pe Internet (U.R.I.) pe care Licenţiatorul o desemnează pentru a fi asociată cu Opera, cu excepţia cazului în care această adresă nu se referă la informaţiile privind paternitatea Operei şi condiţiile de utilizare a Operei. Menţiunea cerută la prezenta literă (d) poate fi introdusă în orice modalitate adecvată; cu toate acestea, în cazul unei Colecţii, dacă apar menţiuni similare pentru toţi Autorii care contribuie la Colecţie, cel puţin o astfel de menţiune este necesar a fi introdusă alături de celelalte menţiuni şi în aceeaşi măsură ca pentru ceilalţi Autori. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, Licenţiatul poate folosi menţiunea cerută în această secţiune doar în scopul atribuirii în modalitatea prevăzută anterior, iar în scopul exercitării drepturilor în condiţiile prezentei licenţe, Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a susţine sau a sugera, direct sau indirect, orice legătură, finanţare sau susţinere din partea Autorului, Titularului de Drepturi Conexe, Licenţiatorului şi/sau părţii desemnate de aceştia pentru atribuire, după caz, pentru Licenţiat sau utilizarea Operei de către Licenţiat, cu excepţia permisiunilor separate, exprese, acordate în scris şi anterior de către Autor, Titularul de drepturi conexe, Licenţiator şi/sau partea desemnată de aceştia pentru atribuire.
Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri: Restricţiile menţionate la literele (a), (b) şi (c) nu se aplică acelor Opere care îndeplinesc doar criteriul dreptului sui generis asupra unei baze de date în conformitate cu legea română privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe.
Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, trebuie să notam:  
Regim legal obligatoriu de gestiune colectivă. În cazul în care un tip de utilizare a Operei ar fi supus unui regim legal obligatoriu de gestiune colectivă (de ex. dreptul la remuneraţie compensatorie pentru copia privată), Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul exclusiv de a colecta remuneraţiile respective prin intermediul organismului de gestiune colectivă competent, atât în cazul utilizării comerciale, cât şi în cazul utilizării necomerciale a Operei;
Regim legal facultativ de gestiune colectivă. În cazul în care un tip de utilizare a Operei ar fi supus unui regim legal facultativ de gestiune colectivă (de ex. dreptul de împrumut), Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul de a colecta remuneraţiile respective prin intermediul organismului de gestiune colectivă competent în cazul utilizării comerciale. Licenţiatorul renunţă la dreptul de a colecta aceste remuneraţii în cazul utilizării necomerciale a Operei;
Gestiunea colectivă a drepturilor. Licenţiatorul renunţă, acolo unde legea permite, la dreptul de a colecta remuneraţiile (independent sau, când Licenţiatorul este un membru al unui organism de gestiune colectivă, prin acesta) pentru utilizările necomerciale ale Operei. Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul de a colecta remuneraţiile (independent, sau cand Licenţiatorul este un membru al unui organism de gestiune colectivă prin acesta) pentru utilizările comerciale ale Operei.
Drepturile morale rămân nemodificate, în măsura în care sunt recunoscute şi nu pot face obliectul unor renunţări în conformitate cu legea aplicabilă.
5. Garanţie şi exonerarea de răspundere 
Prin punerea Operei la dispoziţia publicului în conformitate cu dispoziţiile prezentei licenţe, Licenţiatorul declară de bună credinţă că, în conformitate cu ceea ce cunoaşte şi în limite rezonabile:  
Licenţiatorul a obţinut toate drepturile necesare asupra Operei pentru a putea autoriza exerciţiul drepturilor acordate prin prezenta licenţă şi a permite utilizarea netulburată şi exerciţiul licit al acestor drepturi, aceasta fără ca Licenţiatul să aibă o obligaţie de a plăti vreo remuneraţie, cu excepţia celor prevăzute de mecanismele de gestiune colectivă obligatorie descrise la articolul 4 litera (e);
Opera nu dă naştere vreunei încălcări a drepturilor unor terţe persoane, în special drepturi de autor sau drepturi conexe, drepturi privind mărcile, drepturi privind informaţia, drepturi patrimoniale sau oricare alte drepturi, şi nici vreunei defăimări, violări a dreptului la viaţa privată sau vreunui alt fapt ilicit cu privire la oricare altă terţă parte.
Cu excepţia cazurilor prevăzute expres în prezenta licenţă sau într-un alt acord scris, sau cerute de legea aplicabilă, Opera este pusă la dispoziţie fără vreo garanţie de orice fel, expresă sau tacită, inclusiv în ceea ce priveşte conţinutul Operei sau exactitatea acesteia.
6. Limitarea răspunderii. Cu excepţia răspunderii cerută de normele imperative ale legii aplicabile şi a reparării prejudiciilor impuse de răspunderea faţă de terţi generată de încălcarea garanţiilor prevăzute la articolul 5, Licenţiatorul nu va fi responsabil faţa de Licenţiat, în temeiul niciunei doctrine juridice, pentru orice prejudicii directe, indirecte, materiale sau morale care decurg din această licenţă sau din utilizarea Operei, chiar dacă Licenţiatorul a fost avertizat asupra posibilităţii producerii unor asemenea prejudicii.
7. Rezilierea licenţei
Această licenţă este reziliată de plin drept, iar drepturile acordate prin intermediul său vor înceta în mod implicit în cazul în care Licenţiatul săvârşeşte orice fel de încălcare a condiţiilor licenţei. Licenţele prin care persoane fizice sau persoane juridice au dobândit de la Licenţiat Adaptări sau Colecţii, în condiţiile acestei licenţe, nu vor fi reziliate, atât timp cât respectivii dobânditori vor respecta condiţiile sub care le-au fost acordate drepturile respective. Articolele 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 şi 8 rămân aplicabile chiar după rezilierea prezentei licenţe.
În limitele indicate mai sus, prezenta licenţă se aplică pe întreaga durată de protecţie a Operei conform legii aplicabile. Cu toate acestea, Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul de a exploata Opera şi în alte condiţii contractuale sau de a înceta oricând distribuirea Operei; totuşi, utilizarea acestei opţiuni a Licenţiatorului nu va conduce la restrângerea efectelor prezentei licenţe (sau a oricărei alte licenţe care a fost sau trebuie să fie acordată conform condiţiilor prezentei licenţe), iar licenţa va continua să producă efecte depline, până la rezilierea sa în baza prevederilor menţionate mai sus.
8. Alte prevederi
Cu fiecare reproducere sau comunicare publică în format digital de către Licenţiat a Operei sau a unei Colecţii, Licenţiatorul face primitorului o ofertă de licenţă având ca obiect Opera, conţinând aceleaşi condiţii ca şi prezenta licenţă încheiată cu Licenţiatul.
Dacă o prevedere a prezentei licenţe este nulă sau inaplicabilă conform legislaţiei în vigoare, validitatea sau aplicabilitatea celorlalte dispoziţii ale licenţei nu va fi afectată. Fără a fi necesare alte acţiuni ale părţilor la prezenta licenţă, prevederile nule sau inaplicabile vor fi interpretate în măsura minimă necesară pentru a deveni valide şi aplicabile.
Nu se va considera că s-a renunţat la vreo prevedere a prezentei licenţe sau la invocarea încălcării acesteia, cu excepţia cazului în care o astfel de renunţare este în scris şi semnată de partea care suportă consecinţele renunţării sau invocării încălcării.
Prezenta licenţă constituie convenţia părţilor în întregul său asupra Operei astfel licenţiate. Nu există alte înţelegeri, acorduri sau dispoziţii privind Opera care să nu fie specificate prin prezenta licenţă. Licenţiatorul nu va fi subiect al niciunei dispoziţii suplimentare comunicate de către Licenţiat. Prezenta licenţă nu poate fi modificată fără acordul mutual scris al Licenţiatorului şi al Licenţiatului.
Dreptul aplicabil este dreptul român.
Notă privind Creative Commons
Creative Commons nu este parte a prezentei licenţe şi nu acordă nicio garanţie legată de Operă. Creative Commons nu este răspunzătoare faţă de Licenţiat sau faţă de orice altă persoană, în conformitate cu nicio doctrină juridică, pentru niciun fel de prejudicii, inclusiv, cu titlu exemplificativ, pentru orice prejudicii directe, indirecte, materiale sau morale produse în legătură cu prezenta licenţă. Prin excepţie de la cele două teze anterioare, dacă Creative Commons s-a identificat în mod expres ca fiind Licenţiator în accepţiunea prezentei licenţe, atunci va avea toate drepturile şi obligaţiile Licenţiatorului.
Cu excepţia scopului limitat de a indica publicului că Opera este licenţiată conform LPCC (Licenţa Publică Creative Commons), Creative Commons nu autorizează utilizarea de către niciuna dintre părţi a mărcii „Creative Commons” sau a oricărei alte mărci sau însemne ale Creative Commons fără consimţământul prealabil exprimat în scris al Creative Commons.

Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, limitarea dreptului de a folosi marca Creative Commons nu face parte din prezenţa licenţă.

1. Definiciones
"Obra Derivada" es una obra basada en la Obra licenciada, o en ésta y otras obras preexistentes, tales como traducciones, adaptaciones, trabajos derivativos, arreglos musicales u otras alteraciones de una obra literaria o artística, fonogramas o actuaciones, incluyendo las adaptaciones cinematográficas o cualquier otra forma en la que la Obra pueda ser reformulada, transformada o adaptada incluyendo cualquier forma reconociblemente derivada del original, excepto aquellas obras que constituyan una Colección, las cuales no serán consideradas Obras Derivadas a los fines de esta Licencia. Para evitar cualquier duda, cuando se trate de una obra musical, interpretación o fonograma, la sincronización de la Obra en relación temporal con una imagen en movimiento (sincronización) será considerada como una Obra Derivada para los efectos de esta Licencia.
"Colección" es una recopilación de obras literarias o artísticas, tales como enciclopedias y antologías, o actuaciones, fonogramas o emisiones, u otras obras que figuran en la Sección 1 (f) (como se define a continuación) y que, en razón de la selección y disposición de sus contenidos, constituyan creaciones de carácter intelectual, en las cuales la Obra sea incluida en su totalidad, sin modificaciones, junto con una o más contribuciones distintas, cada una de ellas constituyendo obras separadas e independientes entre sí e integradas en un todo colectivo. Una obra que constituye una Colección no será considerada una Obra Derivada (como se definió antes) para los fines de esta Licencia.

2. Garantía al debido uso. Nada en esta Licencia está dirigido a reducir, limitar o restringir cualquier uso libre de derechos de autor o derechos que surjan de limitaciones o excepciones contempladas en relación con la protección de los derechos de autor bajo la Ley sobre Derecho de Autor u otras leyes aplicables.
3. Concesión de la Licencia. Sujeto a los términos y condiciones de esta Licencia, el Licenciante otorga al Licenciatario una licencia universal, gratuita, no exclusiva, por tiempo indefinido (por la duración aplicable de los derechos de autor) para ejercer los derechos sobre la Obra como se indica a continuación:
Reproducir la Obra, e incorporar la Obra en una o más Colecciones, y Reproducir la Obra incorporada en las Colecciones; y,
Distribuir y Comunicar Públicamente la Obra, incluyendo su incorporación en Colecciones.
Los derechos antes mencionados pueden ejercerse en todos los medios y formatos actualmente conocidos o que se desarrollen en el futuro. Los derechos mencionados incluyen el derecho a efectuar las modificaciones que sean técnicamente necesarias para ejercer los derechos en otros medios y formatos, pero de otra forma no tiene derecho a hacer Obras Derivadas. Sujeto a la Sección 8 (e), todos los derechos no expresamente concedidos por el Licenciante quedan reservados, incluyendo pero no limitado a los derechos descritos en la Sección 4 (d).
4. Restricciones. La licencia otorgada en la Sección anterior 3 está expresamente sujeta y limitada por las siguientes restricciones:
El Licenciatario puede Distribuir o Comunicar Públicamente la Obra sólo bajo los términos de esta Licencia. El Licenciatario debe incluir el Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI), o una copia de la Licencia, con cada copia de la Obra que Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente. No es posible imponer ninguna condición sobre la Obra que restrinja los términos de esta Licencia o el ejercicio de los derechos otorgados a los beneficiarios. El Licenciatario no puede sublicenciar la Obra. El Licenciatario debe mantener intactos todos los anuncios que se refieran a esta Licencia y a la ausencia de garantías en cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente. Cuando el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente la Obra, el Licenciatario no podrá imponer ninguna medida tecnológica efectiva que restrinja la capacidad de un beneficiario de la Obra de ejercer los derechos otorgados a dicho beneficiario según los términos de esta Licencia. Esta Sección 4 (a) se aplica a la Obra incorporada en una Colección, pero esto no exige que la Colección, aparte de la Obra misma, quede sujeta a los términos de esta Licencia. Si el Licenciatario crea una Colección, previo aviso de cualquier Licenciante, deberá, en la medida de lo posible, quitar de la Colección cualquier crédito requerido en la Sección 4 (c), conforme a lo solicitado.
El Licenciatario no puede ejercer ninguno de los derechos que se le otorgan en la Sección 3 de modo que estén principalmente destinados o dirigidos a conseguir un provecho comercial o una compensación monetaria privada. El intercambio de la Obra por otras obras protegidas por el derecho de autor, sea por medio de alguna tecnología digital de intercambio de archivos, o de cualquier otra manera, no será considerado como con la intención ni el propósito de obtener una ventaja comercial o una compensación monetaria privada, siempre que no haya pago de compensación monetaria relacionada con dicho intercambio de obras protegidas por derecho de autor.
Si el Licenciatario Distribuye o Comunica Públicamente la Obra o las Colecciones, el Licenciatario debe, a menos que se haya presentado una solicitud de conformidad con la Sección 4 (a), mantener intactos todos los avisos de derechos de autor de la Obra y proporcionar, de forma razonable con el medio o los medios que el Licenciatario está utilizando: (i) el nombre del Autor Original (o seudónimo, en su caso), y/o si el autor o Licenciante ofrece, el nombre de las partes (por ejemplo, organización de hospedaje, de publicación, editorial, revista) para designar la atribución ("Partes Reconocidas") como se reconoce en el presente aviso legal, términos de uso o cualquier otra manera razonable; (ii) el título de la Obra si fue suministrado; (iii) en la medida de lo razonablemente posible, la URI, si existiese, que el Licenciante haya especificado como asociada a la obra, salvo que tal URI no se refiera al aviso de derechos de autor o a la información sobre la Licencia de la Obra. El crédito requerido por esta Sección 4 (c) puede ser implementado de cualquier forma razonable, prevista, sin embargo, que en el caso de una Colección, tal crédito debe aparecer, como mínimo, como parte de los créditos correspondientes a los demás autores que contribuyeron, y de una manera igual de destacada. Para evitar dudas, el Licenciatario sólo podrá utilizar el crédito requerido por esta Sección 4 (c) con el propósito de la atribución en la manera anteriormente descrita y, al ejercer los derechos otorgados bajo esta Licencia, el Licenciatario no podrá implícita o explícitamente afirmar o implicar ninguna conexión, patrocinio o respaldo por parte del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Partes Reconocidas, según corresponda, del uso de la Obra, sin el permiso independiente, expreso, previo y por escrito del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Partes Reconocidas.
Para evitar cualquier duda:
Sistemas de Licencias Obligatorias Irrenunciables. En aquellas jurisdicciones en las que el derecho a cobrar regalías, a través de cualquier esquema de licencias legales u obligatorias, no se pueda renunciar, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho exclusivo de cobrar regalías para cualquier ejercicio por el Licenciatario de los derechos garantizados por esta Licencia;
Sistemas de Licencias Obligatorias Renunciables. En aquellas jurisdicciones en las que el derecho a cobrar regalías, a través de cualquier esquema de licencias legales u obligatorias pueda ser rechazado, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho exclusivo de cobrar dichas regalías por cualquier ejercicio por el Licenciatario de los derechos garantizados por esta Licencia si, el ejercicio de tales derechos, tiene un propósito o uso de otra forma no comercial, conforme a lo establecido en la Sección 4 (b) y de otra manera que renuncia al derecho a cobrar regalías a través de cualquier esquema de licencias legales u obligatorias; y,
Sistemas de Licencias Voluntarias. El Licenciante se reserva el derecho a cobrar regalías, ya sea individualmente o, en caso de que el Licenciante sea miembro de una sociedad de gestión colectiva que administre los sistemas de licencias voluntarias, a través de la sociedad, para el ejercicio por el titular de los derechos garantizados por esta Licencia con la finalidad o uso que de otro modo no sea comercial conforme a la Sección 4 (b).
Los derechos morales no se ven afectados por esta Licencia en la medida en que sean reconocidos y no se puedan renunciar, de acuerdo con la ley aplicable.
5. Representaciones, Garantías y Exención de Responsabilidades
SALVO MUTUO ACUERDO POR ESCRITO ENTRE LAS PARTES, Y EN TODA LA EXTENSIÓN PERMITIDA POR LA LEY APLICABLE, EL LICENCIANTE OFRECE LA OBRA TAL COMO ES Y SIN BRINDAR GARANTÍAS DE NINGÚN TIPO RESPECTO DE LA OBRA, YA SEA EXPRESA, IMPLÍCITA, POR LEY O DE OTRA MANERA, INCLUYENDO, SIN LIMITACIONES, LAS GARANTÍAS DE TITUTLARIDAD, COMERCIALIZACIÓN, IDONEIDAD PARA UN PROPÓSITO PARTICULAR, INFRACCIÓN, O LA AUSENCIA DE DEFECTOS LATENTES, EXACTITUD, O LA PRESENCIA O AUSENCIA DE ERRORES, SEAN O NO DESCUBRIBLES. ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE PUEDE NO SER APLICABLE AL LICENCIATARIO.
6. Limitación de Responsabilidad. EL LICENCIANTE NO SERÁ RESPONSABLE FRENTE AL LICENCIATARIO POR DAÑO ALGUNO, SEA POR RESPONSABILIDAD EXTRACONTRACTUAL O CONTRACTUAL, OBJETIVA O SUBJETIVA, SE TRATE DE DAÑOS MORALES O PATRIMONIALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PREVISTOS O IMPREVISTOS, PRODUCIDOS POR EL USO DE ESTA LICENCIA O DE LA OBRA, AÚN CUANDO EL LICENCIANTE HAYA SIDO ADVERTIDO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE DICHOS DAÑOS, SALVO QUE ALGUNAS LEYES NO PERMITAN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE CIERTA RESPONSABILIDAD Y/Ó PREVEAN EXPRESAMENTE EL DERECHO DE INDEMNIZACIÓN A FAVOR DEL LICENCIATARIO, EN CUYO CASO ESTA EXCLUSIÓN NO SERÁ APLICABLE.
7. Terminación
La presente Licencia y los derechos aquí concedidos finalizarán automáticamente por el incumplimiento del Licenciatario de los términos de esta Licencia. Las personas o entidades que hayan recibido del Licenciatario las Colecciones bajo esta Licencia, sin embargo, no verán anuladas sus licencias siempre que tales personas o entidades se mantengan en pleno cumplimiento de aquellas licencias. Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, y 8 subsistirán a la terminación de esta Licencia.
Sujeta a los términos y condiciones anteriores, la licencia aquí otorgada es perpetua (por la duración de los derechos de autor de la Obra). No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho de difundir la Obra bajo diferentes términos de licencia o a dejar de distribuirla en cualquier momento, con la salvedad de que tal elección no podrá revocar esta Licencia (ni ninguna otra licencia que haya sido o deba ser concedida bajo los términos de ésta) y que esta Licencia continuará en pleno vigor y efecto a menos que sea finalizada conforme a lo establecido anteriormente.
8. Varios
Cada vez que el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente la Obra o una Colección, el Licenciante ofrecerá al beneficiario una licencia para la Obra en los mismos términos y condiciones que la que aquí se otorga.
Si alguna disposición de esta Licencia es inválida o no exigible bajo la ley aplicable, esto no afectará la validez o aplicabilidad del resto de los términos de esta Licencia y, sin más acción de las partes de este acuerdo, tal disposición se entenderá reformada en la medida mínima necesaria para que sea válida y exigible.
Ninguna de las disposiciones de esta Licencia se considerará renunciable, ni se consentirá violación alguna de ellas, a menos que tal renuncia o consentimiento sea por escrito y firmado por las partes que serán afectadas por tal renuncia o consentimiento.
La presente Licencia constituye el acuerdo completo entre las partes respecto a la Obra aquí licenciada. No hay entendimientos, acuerdos o condiciones respecto a la Obra que no estén especificados aquí. El Licenciante no será obligado por ninguna disposición adicional que pueda aparecer en cualquier comunicación emanada por el Licenciatario. Esta Licencia no puede ser modificada sin el mutuo acuerdo por escrito del Licenciante y el Licenciatario.
Los derechos acá concedidos, y objeto de la materia referenciada, en la presente Licencia se elaboraron utilizando la terminología de la Ley sobre el Derecho de Autor de Venezuela promulgada el 14 de agosto de 1993, y el Reglamento de la Ley Sobre el Derecho de Autor de fecha 09 de septiembre de 1997, la Ley Orgánica del Trabajo, los Trabajadores y las Trabajadoras promulgada en fecha 8 de mayo de 2012 en lo concerniente al Derecho de Autor, la Ley Aprobatoria de Adhesión de Venezuela a la Convención de Berna para la Protección de las Obras Literarias y Artísticas (tal como fue promulgada el 12 de mayo de 1982), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de Roma de 1961 (promulgada 13 de septiembre de 1995), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de París (promulgada el 12 de septiembre de 1995), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de Ginebra (promulgada el 18 de noviembre de 1982), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de la OMPI (promulgada el 23 de noviembre 1984), la Ley Aprobatoria del Tratado de la OMPI (promulgada el 20 de diciembre de 1996), y la Ley Aprobatoria de la Convención Universal de Copyright (promulgada el 19 de octubre, 1995). Si el conjunto estándar de los derechos previstos en la legislación de derechos de autor incluye derechos adicionales no concedidos bajo esta Licencia, tales derechos adicionales se considerarán incluidos en la Licencia, esta Licencia no está destinada a restringir derechos licenciados bajo la ley aplicable.

Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.
Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
Section 1 – Definitions.
Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.
License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.
Section 3 – License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
Attribution.
If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted Material.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.
This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
License
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
"License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f).
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

1. Definitions
"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable License"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.
Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.
Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
Section 1 – Definitions.
Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.
License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.
Section 3 – License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
Attribution.
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
ShareAlike.
In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.
You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.
This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

License
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.
Section 3 – License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
Attribution.
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.
This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Bagian 1 – Definisi.
Materi Adaptasi adalah materi yang memiliki Hak Cipta dan Hak-hak Serupa yang diambil dari atau dibuat berdasarkan Materi Berlisensi dan Materi Berlisensi harus diterjemahkan, diubah, disusun ulang, dialihwujudkan, atau dimodifikasi dengan cara lainnya dengan izin Pemberi Lisensi atas Hak Cipta dan Hak-hak Serupa. Untuk tujuan Lisensi Publik ini, dalam hal Materi Berlisensi adalah ciptaan musikal, pertunjukan, atau rekaman suara, Materi Adaptasi juga tercipta saat Materi Berlisensi dipadukan dengan gambar bergerak.

Anda adalah setiap individu atau entitas hukum yang menggunakan Hak Lisensi di bawah Lisensi Publik ini.
Bagian 2 – Ruang Lingkup.
Ruang lingkup lisensi.
Sesuai dengan syarat dan ketentuan di dalam Lisensi Publik ini, Pemberi Lisensi memberikan Anda lisensi yang berlaku di seluruh dunia, bebas royalti, tidak dapat dilisensikan kembali, non-eksklusif, dan tidak dapat dicabut untuk menggunakan Hak Lisensi pada Materi Berlisensi untuk:
memperbanyak dan Membagikan Materi Berlisensi, dalam bentuk utuh maupun sebagian, hanya untuk kepentingan NonKomersial; dan
menciptakan, memperbanyak, dan Membagikan Materi Adaptasi untuk kepentingan NonKomersial.
Pengecualian dan Pembatasan. Untuk menghindari keraguan, saat Pengecualian dan Pembatasan berlaku atas penggunaan Anda, Lisensi Publik ini tidak berlaku, dan Anda tidak wajib melaksanakan syarat dan ketentuan di dalamnya.
Jangka waktu. Jangka waktu Lisensi Publik ini dijelaskan pada Bagian 6(a).
Media dan format; modifikasi teknis diperbolehkan. Pemberi Lisensi mengizinkan Anda untuk menggunakan Hak Lisensi pada seluruh media dan format baik yang telah diketahui saat ini maupun yang akan diciptakan, dan untuk melakukan modifikasi teknis yang diperlukan. Pemberi Lisensi melepaskan dan/atau setuju untuk tidak menggunakan hak atau kewenangan apapun untuk melarang Anda melakukan modifikasi teknis yang diperlukan untuk menggunakan Hak Lisensi, termasuk modifikasi teknis yang diperlukan untuk menghilangkan Sarana Kontrol Teknologi. Untuk tujuan Lisensi Publik ini, pembuatan modifikasi yang diizinkan Bagian 2(a)(4) ini tidak berarti menghasilkan Materi Adaptasi.
Pengguna lain.
Tawaran dari Pemberi Lisensi – Materi Berlisensi. Setiap pengguna Materi Berlisensi secara otomatis menerima tawaran dari Pemberi Lisensi untuk menggunakan Hak Lisensi di bawah syarat dan ketentuan dalam Lisensi Publik ini.
Tidak ada halangan tambahan. Anda tidak boleh menawarkan atau memberikan syarat dan ketentuan tambahan pada, atau menggunakan Sarana Kontrol Teknologi pada, Materi Berlisensi apabila tindakan tersebut menghalangi penggunaan Hak Lisensi oleh setiap pengguna lain dari Materi Berlinsensi.
Tanpa dukungan. Tidak satupun hal di bawah Lisensi Publik ini memunculkan atau dapat memunculkan izin untuk menyatakan secara langsung maupun tidak langsung bahwa Anda, atau penggunaan Anda atas Hak Lisensi, adalah terkait dengan, atau didukung oleh, atau secara resmi diberikan oleh, Pemberi Lisensi atau pihak lain yang harus menerima atribusi sebagaimana tercantum dalam Bagian 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Hak lainnya.
Hak moral, seperti hak atas integritas, tidak dilisensikan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini, juga hak atas potret, kerahasiaan, dan/atau hak personal serupa lainnya; walau demikian, sejauh yang dimungkinkan, Pemberi Lisensi melepaskan dan/atau setuju untuk tidak menggunakan hak lainnya yang dipegang oleh Pemberi Lisensi hingga batasan tertentu untuk mengizinkan Anda menggunakan Hak Lisensi, dan bukan sebaliknya.
Hak paten dan merek dagang tidak dilisensikan di bawah Lisensi Publik.
Sejauh yang dimungkinkan, Pemberi Lisensi melepaskan hak untuk mendapatkan royalti dari Anda dengan menggunakan Hak Lisensi, baik secara langsung maupun melalui lembaga manajemen kolektif di bawah ketentuan skema lisensi sukarela atau yang dapat dilepaskan maupun skema lisensi wajib. Dalam kondisi lainnya Pemberi Lisensi memiliki hak untuk mendapatkan royalti tersebut, termasuk dalam hal Materi Berlisensi digunakan selain untuk kepentingan NonKomersial.
Bagian 3 – Ketentuan Lisensi.
Penggunaan Anda atas Hak Lisensi bergantung pada ketentuan di bawah ini.
Atribusi.
Apabila Anda Membagikan Materi Berlisensi (termasuk yang telah dimodifikasi), Anda wajib:
mencantumkan hal-hal di bawah ini apabila dinyatakan oleh Pemberi Lisensi di dalam Materi Berlisensi:
identitas para pencipta Materi Berlisensi dan pihak lain yang harus menerima atribusi, dengan cara yang sesuai dengan permintaan Pemberi Lisensi (termasuk penggunaan nama samaran jika ada);
pemberitahuan hak cipta;
pemberitahuan mengenai Lisensi Publik ini;
pemberitahuan mengenai pernyataan jaminan;
PSS (pengidentifikasi sumber seragam) atau tautan kepada Materi Berlisensi jika memungkinkan;
menunjukkan bahwa Anda telah memodifikasi Materi Berlisensi dan menunjukkan setiap modifikasi yang sebelumnya pernah dibuat; dan
menunjukkan bahwa Materi Berlisensi dilisensikan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini, termasuk teks, atau PSS dan tautan kepada, dari Lisensi Publik ini.
Anda dapat melaksanakan ketentuan pada Bagian 3(a)(1) dengan cara yang sesuai dengan perantara, cara, dan konteks penggunaan Anda dalam Membagikan Materi Berlisensi. Sebagai contoh, Anda dapat melaksanakan ketentuan ini dengan memberikan PSS atau tautan kepada sumber yang menyediakan informasi yang dibutuhkan.
Apabila dimintakan demikian oleh Pemberi Lisensi, Anda harus menghilangkan setiap informasi yang dinyatakan dalam Bagian 3(a)(1)(A) jika memungkinkan.
Apabila Anda Membagikan Materi Adaptasi yang Anda buat, Lisensi Pengadaptasi yang harus Anda gunakan tidak dapat menghalangi penerima Materi Adaptasi untuk melaksanakan Lisensi Publik ini.
Bagian 4 – Hak Basis Data Sui Generis.
Apabila Hak Lisensi mencakup Hak Basis Data Sui Generis yang berlaku untuk penggunaan Anda atas Materi Berlisensi:
untuk menghindari keraguan, Bagian 2(a)(1) memberikan hak kepada Anda untuk mengambil, menggunakan kembali, memperbanyak, dan Membagikan seluruh atau sebagian besar dari isi basis data hanya untuk kepentingan NonKomersial;
apabila Anda mencantumkan seluruh atau sebagian besar dari isi basis data di dalam basis data dengan Hak Basis Data Sui Generis yang dapat Anda gunakan, maka basis data dengan Hak Basis Data Sui Generis yang dapat Anda gunakan (namun bukan isinya secara terpisah) adalah Materi Adaptasi; dan
Anda harus melaksanakan ketentuan dalam Bagian 3(a) apabila Anda Membagikan seluruh atau sebagian besar dari isi basis data.
Untuk menghindari keraguan, Bagian 4 ini menambahkan dan tidak menggantikan kewajiban Anda di bawah Lisensi Publik di mana Hak Lisensi termasuk Hak Cipta dan Hak-hak Serupa lainnya.
Bagian 5 – Pernyataan Jaminan dan Batasan Tanggung Jawab.
Kecuali dilaksanakan dengan cara lain secara terpisah oleh Pemberi Lisensi, sejauh yang dimungkinkan, Pemberi Lisensi memberikan Materi Berlisensi “apa adanya” dan “sebagaimana tersedia”, dan tidak memberikan pernyataan atau jaminan apapun terkait Materi Berlisensi, baik secara tegas, secara tersirat, berdasarkan hukum, atau lainnya. Hal ini termasuk, tanpa terbatas pada, jaminan atas hak, jual beli, kecocokan untuk tujuan tertentu, tidak adanya pelanggaran, tidak adanya pengelabuan atau cacat lainnya, keakuratan, atau adanya atau tidak adanya kesalahan, baik yang diketahui maupun tidak. Dalam hal pernyataan jaminan tidak dapat dilaksanakan secara penuh atau sebagian, pernyataan ini tidak berlaku terhadap Anda.
Sejauh yang dimungkinkan, Pemberi Lisensi tidak dapat dianggap bertanggung jawab kepada Anda untuk tindakan hukum apapun (termasuk, tanpa terbatas pada, kelalaian) atau untuk setiap kehilangan, kerugian, pengeluaran, atau kerusakan yang terjadi secara langsung, khusus, tidak langsung, sebagai kecelakaan, akibat, hukuman, pembebasan, atau lainnya yang muncul dari Lisensi Publik ini atau penggunaan Materi Berlisensi, walau pemberi lisensi telah memberitahukan kemungkinan terjadinya kehilangan, kerugian, pengeluaran, atau kerusakan tersebut. Dalam hal pembatasan tanggung jawab tidak dapat dilaksanakan secara penuh atau sebagian, batasan ini tidak berlaku terhadap Anda.
Pernyataan jaminan dan batasan tanggung jawab di atas ini dapat diinterpretasikan dengan cara, sejauh yang dimungkinkan, yang paling dekat dengan pernyataan dan pelepasan dari seluruh tanggung jawab sepenuhnya.
Bagian 6 – Jangka Waktu dan Penghentian.
Lisensi Publik ini berlaku sepanjang jangka waktu Hak Cipta dan Hak-hak Serupa yang dilisensikan di bawahnya. Walau demikian, apabila Anda lalai dalam melaksanakan ketentuan Lisensi Publik ini, maka hak Anda di bawah Lisensi Publik ini akan secara otomatis berakhir.
Dalam hal hak Anda untuk menggunakan Materi Berlisensi telah berakhir sesuai Bagian 6(a), Lisensi Publik ini dapat berlaku kembali:
secara otomatis pada tanggal ditanggulanginya kelalaian yang dilakukan, atau dalam waktu 30 hari setelah Anda mengetahui kelalaian yang dilakukan; atau
berdasarkan pemberlakukan kembali oleh Pemberi Lisensi.
Untuk menghindari keraguan, Bagian 6(b) tidak berpengaruh pada setiap pelanggaran atas hak yang dimiliki oleh Pemberi Lisensi yang terjadi akibat kelalaian Anda melaksanakan ketentuan dalam Lisensi Publik ini.
Untuk menghindari keraguan, Pemberi Lisensi dapat menawarkan Materi Berlisensi di bawah syarat dan ketentuan yang terpisah atau berhenti menyebarluaskan Materi Berlisensi di setiap waktu; namun, hal ini tidak akan menghentikan keberlakuan Lisensi Publik ini.
Bagian 1, 5, 6, 7, dan 8 akan terus berlaku setelah Lisensi Publik ini berakhir.
Bagian 7 – Syarat dan Ketentuan Lain.
Pemberi Lisensi tidak terikat di bawah setiap syarat atau ketentuan tambahan atau syarat atau ketentuan yang berbeda yang Anda sarankan kecuali secara tegas disetujui demikian.
Setiap aturan, kesepakatan, atau perjanjian terkait Materi Berlisensi yang tidak tercantum di sini berlaku secara terpisah dan tidak bergantung pada syarat dan ketentuan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini.
Bagian 8 – Interpretasi.
Untuk menghindari keraguan, Lisensi Publik ini tidak bertujuan untuk, dan tidak dapat dianggap bertujuan untuk, mengurangi, membatasi, menghalangi, atau memaksakan ketentuan dari setiap penggunaan Materi Berlisensi yang secara hukum dapat diciptakan tanpa izin di bawah Lisensi Publik ini.
Sejauh yang dimungkinkan, apabila ketentuan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini dinilai tidak dapat dilaksanakan, maka kewajiban pelaksanaan ketentuan harus dilakukan dengan cara yang sesuai. Apabila ketentuan yang ada tidak dapat dilaksanakan sama sekali, maka ketentuan tersebut ditiadakan dari Lisensi Publik ini namun tidak berpengaruh pada pelaksanaan syarat dan ketentuan lainnya.
Syarat atau ketentuan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini tidak dapat dilepaskan dan tidak ada kelalaian yang diizinkan kecuali secara tegas disetujui demikian oleh Pemberi Lisensi.
Lisensi Publik ini tidak memunculkan atau dapat dianggap sebagai pembatasan dari, atau pelepasan atas, setiap hak dan kekebalan yang berlaku untuk Pemberi Lisensi atau Anda, termasuk dari proses hukum menurut jurisdiksi atau kewenangan apapun.

зазначити, що Ліцензований Матеріал ліцензується за цією Публічною Ліцензією, і надати її текст або Уніфікований Ідентифікатор Ресурсів або гіперпосилання на цю Публічну Ліцензію.
Ви можете виконати умови Статті 3(a)(1) будь-яким розумним чином враховуючи носій, шляхи і умови, за яких Ви Поширюєте Ліцензований Матеріал. Наприклад, може бути розумно виконати такі умови шляхом зазначення Уніфікованого Ідентифікатора Ресурсів або гіперпосилання на ресурс, що містить необхідну інформацію.
У разі наявності відповідної вимоги Ліцензіара, Ви повинні видалити будь-яку інформацію, визначену Статтею 3(a)(1)(A), наскільки це розумно можливо.
Якщо Ви Поширюєте створюваний Вами Адаптований Матеріал, то Ліцензія на Адаптований Матеріал, котру Ви застосовуєте, не повинна унеможливлювати дотримання цієї Публічної Ліцензії отримувачами Адаптованого Матеріалу.
Стаття 4 - Права Sui Generis на Бази Даних.
Якщо Ліцензовані Права включають Права Sui Generis на Бази Даних, що застосовуються до використання Вами Ліцензованого Матеріалу:
для уникнення непорозумінь, Стаття 2(a)(1) надає Вам право вилучати, використовувати, відтворювати і Поширювати весь, або значну частину вмісту бази даних виключно з Некомерційною метою;
якщо Ви включаєте весь або значну частину вмісту бази даних до бази даних, на яку Ви маєте Права Sui Generis на Бази Даних, то база даних, на яку Ви маєте Права Sui Generis на Бази Даних (але не окремі частини її вмісту) є Адаптованим Матеріалом; і
Ви повинні виконувати умови Статті 3(a) якщо Ви Поширюєте весь або значну частину вмісту бази даних.
Для уникнення непорозумінь, ця Стаття 4, якщо Ліцензовані Права включають інші Авторське і Подібні Права, доповнює і не замінює собою Ваші обов’язки за цією Публічною Ліцензією.
Стаття 5 – Відмова від Гарантій і Обмеження Відповідальності.
Якщо інше окремо не зазначено Ліцензіаром, то, наскільки це можливо, Ліцензіар надає Ліцензований Матеріал «як є» і «як доступний», і не надає жодних гарантій будь-якого роду стосовно Ліцензованого Матеріалу, як прямих, так і таких, що можуть матися на увазі, чи гарантій іншого роду. Це включає, але не обмежується: гарантії стосовно назви, придатності для продажу, придатності для певної мети, відсутності порушень прав, відсутності прихованих чи інших дефектів, точності, чи наявності або відсутності помилок, відомих чи таких, що можуть бути виявлені. У разі, якщо відмови від гарантій не дозволені повністю або частково, ця відмова від гарантій може не застосовуватись до Вас.
На скільки це можливо, ні за яких обставин Ліцензіар не буде відповідальний перед Вами з будь-яких правових підстав (включаючи, але не обмежуючись, недбалість) або якимось іншим чином за будь-які прямі, особливі, непрямі, випадкові, побічні, штрафні, чи інші витрати чи збитки, що виникли з цієї Публічної Ліцензії або використання Ліцензованого Матеріалу, навіть якщо Ліцензіар був повідомлений про можливість виникнення таких витрат чи збитків. Дане обмеження може не застосовуватись до Вас якщо обмеження відповідальності частково або повністю не дозволене законодавством.
Вищенаведена відмова від гарантій і обмеження відповідальності повинна тлумачитися таким чином, щоб, наскільки це можливо, найбільш точно відповідати повній відмові від будь-якої відповідальності Ліцензіара.
Стаття 6 – Термін і припинення дії.
Ця Публічна Ліцензія діє протягом всього строку дії ліцензованих за нею Авторського і Подібних Прав. В той же час, якщо Ви не дотримаєтеся умов цієї Публічної Ліцензії, то Ваші права за цією Публічною Ліцензією автоматично припиняють діяти.
Якщо ваше право використовувати Ліцензований Матеріал було припинене згідно Статті 6(a), воно поновлюється:
автоматично в день усунення порушення, за умови, що таке порушення усунене протягом 30 днів з моменту, коли Ви дізнались про нього; або
після окремого поновлення Ліцензіаром.
Для уникнення непорозумінь, ця Стаття 6(b) не обмежує права Ліцензіара звернутися до судових органів для захисту своїх прав у зв’язку з Вашими порушеннями умов цієї Публічної Ліцензії.
Для уникнення непорозумінь, Ліцензіар має право також пропонувати Ліцензований Матеріал на інших умовах чи правилах, або припинити розповсюджувати Ліцензований Матеріал в будь-який час; в той же час, такі його дії не припиняють дії цієї Публічної Ліцензії.

Стаття 7 — Інші правила та умови.

Будь-які домовленості, заяви чи угоди щодо Ліцензованого Матеріалу, не вказані тут, є відокремленими і не залежними від умов та правил цієї Публічної Ліцензії.
Стаття 8 — Тлумачення.
Щоб уникнути непорозумінь, ця Публічна Ліцензія не може бути витлумачена у спосіб, який обмежує, забороняє або накладає інші умови на будь-яке використання Ліцензованого Матеріалу, яке може бути законно здійснене без дозволу згідно цієї Публічної Ліцензії.
Наскільки це можливо, якщо будь-яке положення цієї Публічної Ліцензії вважається таким, що не має законної сили, воно повинне бути автоматично зміненим у мірі, мінімально необхідній для того, щоб це положення набуло законної сили.

License
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

Licence
L’OEUVRE (TELLE QUE DEFINIE CI-DESSOUS) EST MISE A DISPOSITION SELON LES TERMES DE CETTE CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (CI-APRES « CCPL » OU « LICENCE»). L’OEUVRE EST PROTEGEE PAR LE DROIT D’AUTEUR, ET/OU, SI PERTINENT, PAR LES DROITS VOISINS, OU LE DROIT SUI GENERIS SUR LES BASES DE DONNEES ET/OU TOUT AUTRE DROIT APPLICABLE. CONFORMEMENT AUX LOIS EN VIGUEUR. TOUTE UTILISATION DE L’OEUVRE QUI N’EST PAS EXPLICITEMENT AUTORISEE PAR CETTE LICENCE EST INTERDITE. TOUTE UTILISATION DE L’OEUVRE D’UNE MANIERE COUVERTE PAR UN DROIT VISE PAR CETTE LICENCE VAUT ACCEPTATION DE CETTE LICENCE. PAR LA PRESENTE LICENCE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE VOUS OCTROIE LES DROITS DEFINIS CI-APRES SUITE A VOTRE ACCEPTATION DES TERMES ET CONDITIONS SUIVANTES.
1. Définitions
Par «Oeuvre Collective» on entend une œuvre dans laquelle l’Oeuvre, dans sa forme intégrale et non modifiée, est assemblée en un tout collectif avec une série d’autres contributions qui constituent en elles-mêmes des œuvres séparées et indépendantes. Constituent notamment des Oeuvres Collectives les œuvres de compilation, les publications périodiques, les anthologies ou les encyclopédies. Une Oeuvre qui constitue une Oeuvre Collective ne sera pas considérée comme une Oeuvre Dérivée (telle que définie ci-après) aux termes de cette Licence.
Par « Oeuvre Dérivée » on entend une oeuvre créée à partir de l’Oeuvre ou à partir de l’Oeuvre et d’autres oeuvres préexistantes, telle qu’une traduction, un arrangement musical, une adaptation théâtrale, littéraire ou cinématographique, un enregistrement sonore, une reproduction artistique, un résumé ou abrégé, ou toute autre forme sous laquelle l’Oeuvre peut être remaniée, modifiée, transformée ou adaptée, à l’exception des Oeuvres Collectives, qui ne seront pas considérées comme des Oeuvres Dérivées aux termes de la présente Licence. Afin d’éviter toute interprétation contraire, lorsque l’Oeuvre est une composition musicale ou un phonogramme, la synchronisation de cette Oeuvre à une image en mouvement (« synching ») sera considérée comme une Oeuvre Dérivée aux termes de la présente Licence.
Par « Donneur de Licence » on entend la personne physique ou morale qui accorde les droits sur l’Oeuvre selon les termes de la présente Licence.
Par « Auteur originaire » on entend la personne physique qui a créé l’Oeuvre ou, dans le cas d’un objet protégé par un droit voisin, le titulaire originaire du droit voisin.
Par « Oeuvre » on entend l’Oeuvre littéraire et artistique protégée par un droit d'auteur et faisant l’objet de la présente licence. Pour les besoins de la présente Licence, l’ « Oeuvre » inclut également les objets protégés par un droit voisin, tels qu’une interprétation, un phonogramme, une première fixation de film ou une émission de radiodiffusion, ainsi que les bases de données protégées par un droit sui generis, dans la mesure où ceux-ci forment l’objet de la présente licence. Si nécessaire, les dispositions de la présente Licence seront interprétés de manière à pouvoir être appliqués à de tels objets protégés.
Par « Vous » on entend la personne physique ou morale qui utilise l’Oeuvre d’une manière couverte par les droits visés par la présente Licence sans en avoir violé les termes au préalable ou qui a reçu la permission expresse du Donneur de Licence d’exercer ces droits en vertu de cette Licence malgré une violation préalable de cette dernière.
2. Exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs 
Rien dans cette Licence n’a pour effet de réduire, limiter ou restreindre l’application des exceptions aux droits exclusifs des titulaires des droits, à l’épuisement de ces droits ou à d’autres limitations à ces droits selon le droit d’auteur, les droits voisins, le droit sui generis des bases de données ou toute autre loi applicable.
3. Etendue de la Licence accordée
Conformément aux termes et conditions définis dans cette Licence, le Donneur de Licence Vous octroie une licence mondiale, gratuite, non-exclusive et perpétuelle (pour toute la durée de protection de l’Oeuvre par le droit d’auteur, les droits voisins, le droit sui generis des bases de données), d’exercer les droits suivants sur l’Oeuvre:
reproduire l’Oeuvre de quelque manière et sous quelque forme que ce soit, incorporer l’Oeuvre dans une ou plusieurs Oeuvre(s) Collectives et reproduire l’Oeuvre telle qu’incorporée dans lesdites Oeuvres Collectives;
louer, prêter et distribuer des exemplaires de l’Oeuvre, la communiquer au public, la mettre à disposition du public, en ce compris lorsque l’Oeuvre est incorporée dans des Oeuvres Collectives;
lorsque l’Oeuvre est une base de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles de la base de données.
Cette Licence ne modifie en rien le régime de rémunérations équitables éventuellement mis en place en Belgique ou dans d’autres Etats en contrepartie de la reconnaissance légale de licences non volontaires, et n’a aucun effet sur la perception de ces rémunérations.
Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous les supports, médias, et formats, connus ou inconnus, à l’exception des formes d’exploitation encore inconnues. Vous avez également le droit d’apporter les modifications de l’Oeuvre techniquement nécessaires à l’exercice de ces droits sur d’autres supports, médias, et formats, sans que cela vous donne le droit de faire des Œuvres Dérivées. L’Auteur Originaire renonce à exercer son droit moral relativement à ces modifications techniquement nécessaires. Tous les droits qui ne sont pas expressément concédés par le Donneur de Licence, sont réservés.
4. Limitations
La licence accordée à l’article 3 est expressément limitée de la manière suivante:
Vous pouvez prêter, distribuer, mettre à disposition du public, ou communiquer au public l’Oeuvre uniquement selon les termes de cette Licence, à la condition d’annexer une copie de la présente Licence ou l’Uniform Resource Identifier de cette Licence, à toute copie de l’Oeuvre que Vous prêtez, distribuez, mettez à disposition du public, ou communiquez au public. Vous ne pouvez pas offrir ou imposer des conditions d’utilisation de l’Oeuvre qui modifient ou restreignent les termes de la présente Licence ou l’exercice des droits concédés. Vous ne pouvez pas concéder de sous-licence sur l’Oeuvre. Vous devez conserver intactes toutes les indications qui renvoient à cette Licence et à la clause de garantie et d’exonération de responsabilité. Vous ne pouvez pas prêter, distribuer, mettre à disposition du public ou communiquer au public l’Oeuvre en utilisant une mesure technique de contrôle d’accès ou d’utilisation qui serait contraire aux termes de ce Contrat de Licence. Ce qui précède s’applique à l’Oeuvre telle qu’incorporée dans une Oeuvre Collective, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que l’Oeuvre Collective soit elle-même, indépendamment de l’Oeuvre, soumise aux termes de la présente Licence. Si vous créez une Oeuvre Collective, vous devez, à la demande de tout Donneur de Licence et dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l’Oeuvre Collective toute référence au dit Donneur de Licence ou à l’Auteur Originaire.
Si Vous prêtez, distribuez, mettez à disposition du public ou communiquez au public l’Oeuvre ou toute Oeuvre Collective, Vous devez conserver intactes toutes les informations sur le régime des droits relatifs à l’Oeuvre et faire connaître la paternité de l’Oeuvre de l’Auteur Originaire de manière raisonnable eu égard au médium ou au moyen utilisé, notamment en communiquant le nom de l’Auteur Originaire (ou le pseudonyme le cas échéant) s’il est indiqué ; le titre de l’Oeuvre s’il est indiqué ; dans la mesure où cela est raisonnablement possible et s’il existe, l’Uniform Resource Identifier que le Donneur de Licence spécifie comme étant associé à l’Oeuvre, à moins que cet URI ne fasse aucune référence aux informations sur le régime des droits relatif à l’Oeuvre ou sur la licence applicables à l’Oeuvre. Ces indications doivent être mises en oeuvre de manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas d’une Oeuvre Collective, ces informations doivent être indiquées à tout le moins au même endroit et d’une manière aussi visible que le sont les autres mentions de paternité comparables.
5. Clause de garantie et exonération de responsabilité
SAUF DISPOSITION CONTRAIRE CONVENUE PAR ECRIT ENTRE LES PARTIES, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE FOURNIT L’OEUVRE TELLE QUELLE, ET NE FAIT AUCUNE DECLARATION CONCERNANT L’OEUVRE NI NE S’ENGAGE A AUCUNE GARANTIE QUELLE QU’ELLE SOIT RELATIVEMENT A L’OEUVRE, QU’ELLE SOIT EXPRESSE OU TACITE, LEGALE OU AUTRE, EN CE COMPRIS, SANS S’Y LIMITER, LA GARANTIE D’EVICTION, LA POSSIBILITE DE COMMERCIALISER L’OEUVRE, SA CONFORMITE FONCTIONNELLE, L’ABSENCE D’UNE VIOLATION DES DROITS DES TIERS, L’ABSENCE DE VICES CACHES OU AUTRES VICES, L’EXACTITUDE DE L’OEUVRE OU L’ABSENCE D’ERREURS OU DE DEFAUTS D’INFORMATION, DECELABLES OU NON. DANS LE CAS OU LA LEGISLATION APPLICABLE A LA PRESENTE LICENCE INTERDIT OU REGLEMENTE UNE TELLE EXONERATION DE RESPONSABILITE, CETTE EXONERATION DE RESPONSABILITE ET DE GARANTIE NE S’APPLIQUE QUE DANS LA MESURE AUTORISEE PAR LA LOI.
6. Limitation de responsabilité 
DANS LA MESURE AUTORISEE PAR LA LOI APPLICABLE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE SERA EN AUCUN CAS RESPONSABLE A VOTRE EGARD, POUR QUELQUE PREJUDICE QUE CE SOIT, DIRECT OU INDIRECT, MATERIEL OU MORAL, RESULTANT DE L’EXECUTION DE LA PRESENTE LICENCE OU DE L’UTILISATION DE L’OEUVRE, MEME SI LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE A ETE INFORME DE LA POSSIBILITE DE TELS PREJUDICES.
7. Fin du contrat 
Tout manquement aux termes de cette Licence, dont Vous seriez responsable, entraîne sa résolution de plein droit et la fin des droits qui en découlent. Cependant, les licences sur des Oeuvres Dérivées ou des Oeuvres Collectives qui furent concédées sous les termes de cette Licence par Vous à des personnes physiques ou morales conservent leurs effets à l’égard de ces personnes physiques ou morales, pour autant que ces dernières ne violent pas les termes de ces licences. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 continueront à sortir leurs effets nonobstant toute résolution de la présente Licence.
Sans préjudice des dispositions, termes et conditions énoncées ci-dessus, la présente licence est perpétuelle (pour toute la durée de protection de l’Oeuvre par un droit d’auteur, des droits voisins ou un droit sui generis sur les bases de données).

Licentie
HET WERK (ZOALS HIERONDER OMSCHREVEN) WORDT TER BESCHIKKING GESTELD OVEREENKOMSTIG DE BEPALINGEN VAN DEZE CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (HIERNA “CCPL” OF “LICENTIE”). HET WERK WORDT BESCHERMD DOOR HET AUTEURSRECHT, EN/OF, INDIEN RELEVANT, DOOR DE NABURIGE RECHTEN, OF HET SUI GENERIS DATABANKENRECHT EN/OF ELK KRACHTENS DE GELDENDE WETGEVING VAN TOEPASSING ZIJNDE RECHT.

DOOR DEZE LICENTIE KENT DE LICENTIEGEVER U DE HIERNA OMSCHREVEN RECHTEN TOE INDIEN U DE VOLGENDE BEPALINGEN EN VOORWAARDEN AANVAARDT
1. Definities
Met “Collectief Werk” wordt een werk bedoeld waarin het Werk, in zijn geheel en in ongewijzigde vorm, samen met een aantal andere bijdragen, die elk een afzonderlijk en zelfstandig Werk vormen, tot een collectief geheel is samengevoegd. Collectieve Werken zijn onder andere geregeld een uitgave van een tijdschrift, bloemlezingen of encyclopedieën. Een Werk dat een Collectief Werk is, zal, krachtens deze Licentie, niet beschouwd worden als een Afgeleid Werk (zoals hieronder omschreven).
Met "Afgeleid Werk" wordt een werk bedoeld dat gebaseerd is op het Werk of op het Werk en andere reeds bestaande werken, zoals een vertaling, een muziekarrangement, een toneel-, literaire of cinematografische bewerking, een geluidsopname, een kunstreproductie, een ingekorte versie, een samenvatting of elke andere vorm waarin het Werk gewijzigd, omgezet of bewerkt kan worden, met uitzondering van de Collectieve Werken, die niet als Afgeleide Werken zullen beschouwd worden in de zin van deze Licentie. Om onduidelijkheid te vermijden zal, indien het Werk een muziekwerk of een fonogram is, de synchronisatie van het Werk met een bewegend beeld (“synching”) als een Afgeleid Werk in de zin van deze Licentie beschouwd worden.
Met "Licentiegever" wordt de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon bedoeld die de rechten op het Werk toekent volgens de bepalingen van deze Licentie.
Met "Oorspronkelijke Auteur” wordt de natuurlijke persoon bedoeld die het Werk gemaakt heeft of, indien het gaat om een voorwerp dat door een naburig recht beschermd wordt, de oorspronkelijke titularis van het naburig recht.
Met "Werk” wordt het Werk van letterkunde of kunst bedoeld dat beschermd wordt door het auteursrecht en dat het voorwerp is van deze licentie. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie omvat het “Werk” ook voorwerpen die beschermd worden door een naburig recht, zoals een uitvoering, een fonogram, een eerste vastlegging van film of radio-uitzending, alsook de databanken die beschermd worden door een sui generis-recht, voor zover deze het voorwerp vormen van deze licentie. Indien nodig, zullen de bepalingen van deze Licentie op zo een manier geïnterpreteerd worden dat ze op dergelijke beschermde voorwerpen toegepast kunnen worden.
Met "U" wordt de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon bedoeld die het Werk gebruikt op een wijze die geregeld wordt door de rechten waarop deze Licentie betrekking heeft en die de bepalingen van deze Licentie met betrekking tot het Werk niet eerder geschonden heeft of die de uitdrukkelijke toestemming van de Licentiegever gekregen heeft om rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen ondanks een eerdere schending van deze.
2. Uitzonderingen en beperkingen op de exclusieve rechten
Niets in deze Licentie heeft de bedoeling de toepassing van de uitzonderingen op de exclusieve rechten van de rechthebbenden, de uitputting van deze rechten of andere beperkingen op deze rechten krachtens het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het sui generis databankenrecht of elk ander van toepasselijk recht te verminderen, te begrenzen of te beperken.
3. Omvang van de toegekende Licentie
In overeenstemming met de bepalingen en voorwaarden van deze Licentie, verleent de Licentiegever U een licentie die wereldwijd, gratis, niet-exclusief en onbeperkt in tijd (voor de volledige duur van de bescherming van het Werk door het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het sui generis recht op de databanken) is om de volgende rechten met betrekking tot het Werk uit te oefenen:
het reproduceren, op welke wijze en in welke vorm dan ook, van het Werk, het opnemen van het Werk in één of meer Collectieve Werken en het reproduceren van het Werk zoals het opgenomen is in de genoemde Collectieve Werken;
het verhuren, uitlenen en verspreiden van exemplaren van het Werk, het meedelen aan het publiek en het ter beschikking stellen van het publiek. Hetzelfde geldt voor het Werk wanneer het opgenomen is in een Collectief Werk;
indien het Werk een databank is, het opvragen en hergebruiken van substantiële delen van de databank.
Deze Licentie wijzigt geenszinsnde regeling van de billijke vergoedingen, die eventueel van kracht is in België of in andere landen, ter compensatie van de wettelijke erkenning van gedwongen licenties en heeft geen invloed op de inning van deze vergoedingen.
De hierboven vermelde rechten mogen uitgeoefend worden op alle bekende en onbekende dragers, media en formaten, met uitzondering van onbekende exploitatievormen. U heeft eveneens het recht om die wijzigingen aan het Werk aan te brengen die technisch noodzakelijk zijn voor de uitoefening van de hoger genoemde rechten op andere dragers, media en formaten, zonder dat dit U het recht geeft om Afgeleide Werken te maken. Oorspronkelijke Auteur ziet af van de uitoefening van zijn/haar morele rechten met betrekking tot de wijzigingen die technisch noodzakelijk zijn. De Licentiegever behoudt zich alle rechten voor die niet uitdrukkelijk overgedragen zijn in deze Licentie.
4. Beperkingen
De in artikel 3 toegekende licentie wordt uitdrukkelijk op de volgende manier beperkt:
U mag het Werk enkel in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Licentie, uitlenen, verspreiden, ter beschikking stellen van het publiek of meedelen aan het publiek op voorwaarde dat U een kopie van deze Licentie of de Uniform Resource Identifier van deze Licentie toevoegt aan elke kopie van het Werk dat U uitleent, verspreidt, ter beschikking stelt van het publiek of meedeelt aan het publiek. U mag geen voorwaarden op het gebruik van het Werk aanbieden of opleggen die de bepalingen van deze Licentie of de uitoefening van de toegekende rechten wijzigen of beperken. U mag het werk niet in onderlicentie geven. U moet alle aanduidingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie en naar de garantieclausule en de uitsluiting van aansprakelijkheid intact houden. U mag het Werk niet uitlenen, verspreiden, ter beschikking stellen van het publiek of meedelen aan het publiek indien daarbij een technische maatregel gebruikt wordt die de toegang tot of het gebruik van het Werk op een met de bepalingen van deze Licentie strijdige wijze controleert. Het voorgaande geldt voor het Werk dat opgenomen is in een Collectief Werk maar dat houdt niet in dat het Collectief Werk zelf, afgezien van het Werk, onderworpen wordt aan de bepalingen van deze Licentie. Indien U een Collectief Werk maakt, dan moet U, op aanvraag van om het even welke Licentiegever en in de mate van het mogelijke, elke verwijzing naar de Licentiegever of de Oorspronkelijke Auteur uit het Collectief Werk verwijderen.
Indien U het Werk of Collectieve Werken uitleent, verspreidt, ter beschikking stelt aan het publiek of meedeelt aan het publiek, dan moet U alle informatie betreffende het beheer van rechten met betrekking tot het Werk intact houden en, op een wijze die redelijk is in verhouding tot het gebruikte medium of middel, verwijzen naar de Oorspronkelijke Auteur, door het verstrekken van de naam van de Oorspronkelijke Auteur (of het pseudoniem indien van toepassing) indien deze wordt vermeld; de titel van het Werk indien deze wordt vermeld; in de mate dit redelijkerwijze mogelijk is en indien deze beschikbaar is, de Uniform Resource Identifier, dat de Licentiegever aanduidt als verbonden met het Werk, tenzij die URI niet verwijst naar de informatie betreffende het beheer van rechten met betrekking tot het Werk of naar de van toepassing zijnde licenties op het Werk. De verwijzing naar de Oorspronkelijke Auteur moet gebeuren op een redelijke manier. In het geval van een Collectief Werk, moeten deze verwijzingen echter minstens weergegeven worden op dezelfde plaats en op dezelfde wijze als andere vergelijkbare auteursvermeldingen.
5. Garantieclausule en uitsluiting van aansprakelijkheid
TENZIJ ER TUSSEN DE PARTIJEN SCHRIFTELIJK ANDERS OVEREENGEKOMEN IS, BIEDT DE LICENTIEGEVER HET WERK AAN ZOALS HET IS EN DOET DE LICENTIEGEVER GEEN VERKLARINGEN OVER HET WERK OF VERPLICHT HIJ ZICH TOT GEEN ENKELE GARANTIE, ONGEACHT OF DEZE UITDRUKKELIJK OF STILZWIJGEND, KRACHTENS DE WET OF OP EEN ANDERE GRONDSLAG RUST, HIERIN BEGREPEN, MAAR NIET BEPERKT TOT DE GARANTIE TEGEN UITWINNING, DE COMMERCIALISEERBAARHEID VAN HET WERK, DE FUNCTIONELE CONFORMITEIT, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN INBREUK OP RECHTEN VAN DERDEN, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN VERBORGEN OF ANDERE GEBREKEN, DE NAUWKEURIGHEID VAN HET WERK OF DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN FOUTEN EN GEBREKEN MET BETREKKING TOT DE INFORMATIE, ONGEACHT OF DEZE AL DAN NIET OPSPOORBAAR ZIJN. INDIEN DE OP DEZE LICENTIE VAN TOEPASSELIJKE WETGEVING EEN DERGELIJKE UITSLUITING VAN VERANTWOORDELIJKHEID VERBIEDT OF REGLEMENTEERT, DAN IS DEZE UITSLUITING VAN AANSPRAKELIJKHEID EN GARANTIE SLECHTS IN DE MATE TOEGELATEN DOOR DE WET VAN TOEPASSING.
6. Beperking van aansprakelijkheid
VOOR ZOVER DE VAN TOEPASSELIJKE WETGEVING DIT TOELAAT, ZAL DE LICENTIEGEVER IN GEEN ENKEL GEVAL AANSPRAKELIJK GEACHT WORDEN VOOR WELKE RECHTSTREEKSE OF ONRECHTSTREEKSE, MATERIËLE OF MORELE SCHADE DAN OOK, DIE VOORTVLOEIT UIT DEZE LICENTIE OF UIT HET GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK, ONGEACHT OF DE LICENTIEGEVER INGELICHT WERD OVER DE MOGELIJKHEID VAN DERGELIJKE SCHADE.
7. Beëindiging
Elke inbreuk op de bepalingen van deze Licentie waarvoor U verantwoordelijk bent, leidt tot de ontbinding van rechtswege van deze Licentie en het einde van de rechten die er uit voortvloeien. Niettemin behouden de licenties op Afgeleide Werken of Collectieve Werken, die door U krachtens deze Licentie verleend werden aan natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen, hun werking ten opzichte van deze natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen, voor zover deze personen de bepalingen van deze licenties niet schenden. De artikels 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 en 8, blijven van kracht ongeacht de beëindiging van deze Licentie.
Indien de hierboven vermelde bepalingen en voorwaarden in acht genomen worden, is deze licentie onbeperkt in tijd (voor de duur van de bescherming van het Werk door het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten en het sui generis databankenrecht). Desalniettemin behoudt de Licentiegever zich op elk ogenblik het recht voor om het Werk onder een andere licentie of onder andere voorwaarden te exploiteren of om elke verspreiding van het Werk stop te zetten, zonder dat het gebruik maken van deze mogelijkheid deze Licentie (of elke andere licentie die, krachtens de bepalingen van deze Licentie, verleend werd of verleend moest worden) ongedaan kan maken, en deze Licentie zal onverminderd van kracht blijven tenzij de beëindiging intreedt wegens de hoger aangegeven redenen.
8. Diversen
Telkens U het Werk of een Collectief Werk uitleent, verspreidt, meedeelt of ter beschikking stelt van het publiek, verleent de Licentiegever aan de ontvanger een licentie die van toepassing is op het Werk en die dezelfde bepalingen en voorwaarden bevat als deze Licentie.
Indien een bepaling uit deze Licentie, krachtens het van toepassing zijnde recht, nietig of niet afdwingbaar is, dan zal dit geen invloed hebben op de geldigheid en de afdwingbaarheid van de andere bepalingen. In dit geval zal, zonder dat enige tussenkomst van de partijen hiervoor nodig is, een dergelijke bepaling op een zodanige wijze geïnterpreteerd worden dat haar geldigheid en afdwingbaarheid gevrijwaard blijven.
Geen enkele afstand ten opzichte van de bepalingen en voorwaarden van deze Licentie wordt vermoed zonder een schriftelijke overeenkomst die ondertekend is door de partij die afstand doet. Geen enkele inbreuk op deze Licentie wordt door de andere partij aanvaard zonder schriftelijke overeenkomst, ondertekend door deze partij.
Deze Licentie is het enige contract tussen de partijen met betrekking tot het Werk, dat het voorwerp is van deze Licentie. Er bestaat geen enkele overeenkomst of document van welke aard dan ook, die betrekking heeft op het Werk, bovenop wat hier bepaald is. De Licentiegever is gebonden door geen enkele bijkomende verplichting die voortvloeit uit enige communicatie afkomstig van U, ongeacht de vorm. Deze Licentie kan niet gewijzigd worden zonder de schriftelijke overeenkomst van beide partijen.
Creative Commons is geen partij bij deze Licentie en verleent geen enkele garantie met betrekking tot het Werk. Creative Commons sluit alle verantwoordelijkheid met betrekking tot deze Licentie tegenover U en tegenover elke derde uit, ongeacht de juridische grondslag van deze verantwoordelijkheid en ongeacht de aard van de opgelopen schade, of deze rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks, materieel of moreel is. Zonder dat afbreuk gedaan wordt aan de vorige alinea, zal Creative Commons, indien deze zich uitdrukkelijk bekendgemaakt heeft als Licentiegever in het kader van deze Licentie, alle rechten en plichten van Licentiegever bezitten. Met uitzondering van het gebruik dat bestemd is om het publiek te informeren dat het Werk onder CCPL valt, zal geen enkele partij het merk “Creative Commons” of enige andere aanduiding of logo dat toekomt aan Creative Commons gebruiken zonder de voorafgaande schriftelijke instemming van Creative Commons. Elk door Creative Commons toegelaten gebruik moet in overeenstemming zijn met de trademark usage guidelines die van kracht zijn op het ogenblik van het gebruik, zoals deze gepubliceerd worden op de website of beschikbaar worden gesteld op individueel verzoek.

Licens
Værket (som det defineres nedenfor) tilbydes på de betingelser, som følger af denne Creative Commons Public Licens ("CCPL" eller "Licensen"). Værket er beskyttet af ophavsretten og/eller anden gældende ret. Enhver brug af Værket udover den, der følger af Licensen eller af ophavsretten i øvrigt, er ikke tilladt.
Ved at udøve den ret Licensen giver til Værket, accepterer du at være bundet af samtlige vilkår som er angivet nedenfor i denne licens.
1. Definitioner
"Samleværk" betyder et værk, såsom en periodisk udgivelse, en antologi eller et opslagsværk, i hvilket Værket i uændret form, sammen med et antal andre bidrag, der i sig selv udgør enkeltstående og uafhængige værker, bliver samlet til en helhed. Et værk, der udgør et Samleværk, vil ikke ifølge vilkårene i Licensen blive betragtet som et Bearbejdet Værk (som dette begreb er defineret nedenfor).
"Bearbejdet Værk" (en bearbejdelse) betyder et værk, der er baseret på Værket eller på Værket og andre ældre værker, såsom en oversættelse, et musikalsk arrangement, en dramatisering, 'fiktionalisering', filmversionering, lydoptagelse, billedgengivelse, forkortelse, sammenfatning eller en hvilken som helst anden form til hvilken Værket kan blive konverteret, ændret eller tilpasset, med undtagelse af et Samleværk der ifølge vilkårene i Licensen ikke skal betragtes som et Bearbejdet Værk. I tilfælde af, at Værket er et musikværk eller en lydoptagelse, skal synkroniseringen med et filmværk betragtes som et Bearbejdet Værk ifølge Licensen.
"Licensgiver" betyder den fysiske eller juridiske person, som tilbyder benyttelse af Værket på de vilkår, som følger af Licensen.
"Originær Rettighedshaver" betyder den fysiske eller juridiske person, som har skabt Værket.
"Værk" betyder den frembringelse eller den præstation, der er beskyttet af egentlige ophavsrettigheder eller af ophavsretsbeslægtede rettigheder, og som tilbydes på de vilkår der følger af denne Licens.
"Du"/"Dig" betyder en fysisk eller juridisk person, der udøver rettigheder i henhold til Licensen, og som ikke tidligere har misligholdt vilkårene i Licensen i forhold til Værket, eller som har fået en udtrykkelig tilladelse fra Licensgiveren til at udøve rettigheder ifølge Licensen på trods af en tidligere misligholdelse af vilkårene i Licensen.
2. Indskrænkninger
Licensen har ikke til formål på nogen måde at begrænse retten til eksemplarfremstilling til privat brug, citatretten eller andre indskrænkninger i rettighedshaverens eksklusive rettigheder i henhold til ophavsretsloven eller i henhold til anden gældende ret.
3. Licensaftalen
I overensstemmelse med vilkårene i Licensen erhverver Du fra licensgiver en global, royalty-fri, ikke-eksklusiv, tidsubegrænset (i Værkets beskyttelsesperiode) ret til at udnytte Værket på følgende måde:
at fremstille eksemplarer af Værket, at indarbejde Værket i et eller flere Samleværker og at fremstille eksemplarer af Værket i det omfang, det er indarbejdet i Samleværket;
at sprede eksemplarer af Værket til almenheden, vise Værket offentligt, fremføre Værket offentligt, herunder overføre Værket til almenheden, inklusive Værket som det indgår i Samleværket;
Royalties for kommerciel udnyttelse:
Royalties for kommerciel offentlig fremførelse. Licensgiver fraskriver sig eneretten til individuelt eller gennem en rettighedshaverorganisation (som fx KODA, Gramex og Copydan) at opkræve royalties for offentlig fremførelse, herunder offentlig digital fremførelse (fx webcast), af Værket.
Mekaniske rettigheder og eksemplarfremstillingsrettigheder . Licensgiver fraskriver sig eneretten til individuelt eller gennem en rettighedshaverorganisation (som fx NCB og Copydan) at opkræve royalties for enhver indspilning og eksemplarfremstilling af Værket
Webcasting rettigheder. Webcasting er offentlig fremførelse og er således omfattet af bestemmelserne ovenfor under (c)(i).
Ovenstående rettigheder må udøves i alle eksisterende og fremtidige medier og formater. Ovenstående rettigheder inkluderer retten til at udføre sådanne ændringer, som er teknisk nødvendige for at kunne udøve rettighederne på andre medier og formater, men herudover har Du ingen rettigheder til at skabe Bearbejdede Værker. De rettigheder, der ikke udtrykkeligt er nævnt ovenfor, forbliver hos Licensgiver.
4. Begrænsninger
Den meddelte licens efter punkt 3 ovenfor er undergivet og begrænset af følgende indskrænkninger:
Du må alene sprede Værket til almenheden, vise Værket offentligt, fremføre Værket offentligt herunder overføre Værket trådbunden eller trådløs til almenheden under iagttagelse af vilkårene i Licensen, og hver gang Du spreder Værket til almenheden, viser Værket offentligt, fremfører Værket offentligt herunder overfører Værket trådbunden eller trådløs til almenheden, skal det ledsages af en kopi af Licensen eller Uniform Ressource Identifier for Licensen. Du må ikke tilbyde eller påbyde betingelser for Værket, som ændrer eller indskrænker Licensens vilkår eller modtagernes udøvelse af deres rettigheder efter Licensen. Du må ikke give underlicenser til Værket. Du skal sikre, at alle meddelelser, som henviser til Licensen og til ansvarsfraskrivelsen, videregives i uændret form. Du må ikke sprede Værket til almenheden, vise Værket offentligt, fremføre Værket offentligt herunder overføre Værket trådbunden eller trådløs til almenheden under anvendelse af nogen form for tekniske foranstaltninger, som begrænser adgangen til eller brugen af Værket på en måde, som er i strid med vilkårene i Licensen. Ovennævnte finder tilsvarende anvendelse på Værket, som udgør en del af et Samleværk, men det er ikke et krav, at Samleværket bortset fra Værket som sådan skal være undergivet vilkårene i Licensen. Hvis Du skaber et Samleværk, skal Du, efter at have modtaget påkrav herom fra en hvilken som helst Licensgiver, i den udstrækning det er praktisk muligt, slette enhver kreditering som krævet ifølge punkt 4(b) fra Samleværket.
Såfremt du spreder Værket eller Samleværket til almenheden, viser Værket eller Samleværket offentligt, fremfører Værket eller Samleværket offentligt herunder overfører Værketeller Samleværket til almenheden, skal Du sikre, at Copyright Notices (copyright mærkning), videregives intakt, samt kreditering i overensstemmelse med god skik under hensyn til det medium og de midler, Du anvender: (i) ved angivelse af navnet (eller i påkommende tilfælde pseudonymet) på den Originære Rettighedshaver, hvis det er tilvejebragt, og/eller (ii) hvis den Originære Rettighedshaver og/eller Licensgiver har aftalt, at en eller flere andre parter (f.eks. en bevillingsgiver, en sponsorinstitution, en forlagsenhed, et tidsskrift) skal navngives i forbindelse med licensgivers Copyright Notice, ved angivelse af karakteren af den ydelse, en sådan part måtte have ydet, eller ved andre rimelige midler navnet på en sådan part eller sådanne parter; Værkets titel, hvis det er tilvejebragt; i den udstrækning det er praktisk muligt, Uniform Resource Identifier, hvis der findes en sådan, som Licensgiver har angivet at være knyttet til Værket, medmindre en sådan URI ikke henviser til Copyright Notice eller information om Licensen. En sådan angivelse skal foretages i overensstemmelse med god skik. Ved et Samleværk skal en sådan angivelse dog i det mindste foretages der, hvor tilsvarende kreditering finder sted, og på en sådan måde som i det mindste er lige så fremtrædende som krediteringen af lignende rettighedshavere.
5. Ansvarsfraskrivelse I
Med mindre andet skriftligt er aftalt mellem parterne, tilbyder Licensgiver Værket,"som det er og forefindes" uden indeståelse af nogen art vedrørende Værket. Dette gælder både udtrykkelig indeståelse, samt indeståelse, som licenstager måtte forudsætte, og omfatter uden begrænsninger indeståelse vedrørende rettighedssubjekter, Værkets kommercielle egenskaber og andre egenskaber ved selve Værket, ikke-krænkelse samt Værkets anvendelighed i relation til et bestemt formål. I visse jurisdiktioner tillades ikke begrænsninger på en indeståelse, der er forudsat af en medkontrahent, så denne begrænsning gælder muligvis ikke for Dig.
6. Ansvarsfraskrivelse II
Med undtagelse af hvad der følger af gældende ret, fraskriver Licensgiver sig ethvert ansvar over for Dig i relation til licensen og brug af værket for så vidt angår alle former for skade herunder direkte og indirekte skade, selv hvis Licensgiver har fået meddelelse om, at en sådan skade ville kunne opstå.
7. Licensens ophør
Licensen samt de rettigheder, der er indrømmet herved, ophører straks ved enhver misligholdelse fra Din side af vilkår indeholdt i Licensen. Fysiske eller juridiske personer, som har modtaget Samleværker, som defineret under punkt 1, fra Dig i medfør af Licensen vil imidlertid ikke få deres licenser bragt til ophør, såfremt disse fysiske eller juridiske personer til fulde respekterer disse licenser. Uanset ophøret af Licensen opretholdes gyldigheden af bestemmelserne under punkterne 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 og 8.
I overensstemmelse med ovenstående vilkår er den her tildelte licens tidsubegrænset (i Værkets beskyttelsesperiode). Uanset det ovenfor anførte forbeholder Licensgiver sig retten til at tilgængeliggøre Værket under andre, alternative vilkår samt at ophøre med tilgængeliggørelsen af Værket på ethvert tidspunkt, såfremt en sådan handling ikke har til formål at trække Licensen tilbage (eller enhver anden licens, som er afgivet i medfør af eller er betinget af vilkårene i Licensen), og Licensen vil forblive fuldt gyldig, medmindre den er bragt til ophør som anført ovenfor.
8. Øvrige bestemmelser
Hver gang Du tilgængeliggører Værket eller et Samleværk for almenheden, herunder ved trådbunden eller trådløs overføring til almenheden, tilbyder Licensgiver modtageren en licens til Værket på de samme vilkår, som gælder i forhold til Dig ifølge Licensen.
Hvis dele af Licensen er ugyldige i medfør af gældende ret, skal dette ikke påvirke gyldigheden af de øvrige dele af Licensen, og aftalen skal uden videre fortolkes således, at de ugyldige dele tilpasses med det minimum af ændringer, der skal til for at gøre delene gyldige i bedst mulige overensstemmelse med aftalens formål og målsætninger.
En part skal ikke anses for at have afstået fra at gøre vilkårene i Licensen gældende, eller givet tilladelse til en overtrædelse heraf, medmindre et skriftligt tilsagn er underskrevet af den part, som foretager en sådan afståelse eller giver en sådan tilladelse.
Licensen udgør den fuldstændige aftale mellem parterne vedrørende det licenserede Værk. Der er ingen underforståede aftalevilkår eller tilkendegivelser vedrørende værket, som ikke er angivet her. Licensgiver er ikke bundet af yderligere vilkår, som måtte være tilkendegivet af Dig. Licensen kan ikke ændres uden gensidig, skriftlig aftale mellem Licensgiver og Dig.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
"Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
"Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

DER GEGENSTAND DIESER LIZENZ (WIE UNTER „SCHUTZGEGENSTAND“ DEFINIERT) WIRD UNTER DEN BEDINGUNGEN DIESER CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL", „LIZENZ“ ODER "LIZENZVERTRAG") ZUR VERFÜGUNG GESTELLT. DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER ANDERE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT. JEDE FORM DER NUTZUNG DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, DIE NICHT AUFGRUND DIESER LIZENZ ODER DURCH GESETZE GESTATTET IST, IST UNZULÄSSIG.
DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINES DURCH DIESE LIZENZ GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH EINVERSTANDEN. SOWEIT DIESE LIZENZ ALS LIZENZVERTRAG ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ GENANNTEN RECHTE UNENTGELTLICH UND IM AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN AKZEPTIEREN.
1. Definitionen
Der Begriff "Bearbeitung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange dieses erkennbar vom Schutzgegenstand abgeleitet wurde. Dies kann insbesondere auch eine Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes.
Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.
"Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Bearbeitungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt.
"Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und eine Erteilung, Übertragung oder Einräumung von Nutzungsbewilligungen bzw Nutzungsrechten an Dritte erlaubt.
Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art oder ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff „Schutzgegenstand“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz.
Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährte Nutzungsbewilligung trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben.
Unter "Öffentlich Wiedergeben"im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Wahrnehmbarmachungen des Schutzgegenstandes in unkörperlicher Form zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung oder zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zurverfügungstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.
"Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, gleichviel in welchem Verfahren, auf welchem Träger, in welcher Menge und ob vorübergehend oder dauerhaft, Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch das erstmalige Festhalten des Schutzgegenstandes oder dessen Wahrnehmbarmachung auf Mitteln der wiederholbaren Wiedergabe sowie das Herstellen von Vervielfältigungsstücken dieser Festhaltung, sowie die Speicherung einer geschützten Darbietung oder eines Bild- und/oder Schallträgers in digitaler Form oder auf einem anderen elektronischen Medium.
2. Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte
Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die sich aus den Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte, anderen Beschränkungen der Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers oder anderen entsprechenden Rechtsnormen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung
Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz erteilt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.c) - die vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte Nutzungsbewilligung, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art und Weise zu nutzen:
Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; und
Den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten.
Bezüglich der Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie geltend zu machen.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Soweit Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Geltendmachung der Vergütungsansprüche durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.
Die vorgenannte Nutzungsbewilligung wird für alle bekannten sowie alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Sie beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich vom Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf die Geltendmachung sämtlicher daraus resultierender Rechte.
4. Bedingungen
Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dasselbe gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.b) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen.
Die Verbreitung und die öffentliche Wiedergabe des Schutzgegenstandes oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Urheberschaft oder die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie selbst – soweit bekannt – Folgendes angeben:
Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers, und/oder falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) („Zuschreibungsempfänger“), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
den Titel des Inhaltes;
in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand.
Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.b) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung aller Beitragenden dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Urhebers, des Lizenzgebers und/oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder implizit noch explizit irgendeine Verbindung mit dem oder eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch den Lizenzgeber oder den Zuschreibungsempfänger andeuten oder erklären.
Die oben unter 4.a) und b) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen.
(Urheber)Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt.
5. Gewährleistung
SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE ERTEILUNG DER NUTZUNGSBEWILLIGUNG UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN.
6. Haftungsbeschränkung
ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER 5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER IHNEN GEGENÜBER FÜR SCHÄDEN JEGLICHER ART NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG FÜR FOLGE- ODER ANDERE SCHÄDEN, AUCH WENN ER ÜBER DIE MÖGLICHKEIT IHRES EINTRITTS UNTERRICHTET WURDE.
7. Erlöschen
Diese Lizenz und die durch sie erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die den Schutzgegenstand enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort.
Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.
8. Sonstige Bestimmungen
Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat.
Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß 8.a) angebotenen Lizenzen aus.
Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Republik Österreich Anwendung.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collection" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole. A Collection may, for example, include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purposes of this Licence.
"Derivative Work" means material in any form that is created by editing, modifying or adapting the Work, a substantial part of the Work, or the Work and other pre-existing works. Derivative Works may, for example, include a translation, adaptation, musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be transformed or adapted, except that a Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public by any means, including publication, electronic communication, or broadcast.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this Licence.
"Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work.
"Reproduce" means to make a copy of the Work in any material form (eg storage in digital form).
"Work" means the material (including any work or other subject matter) protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. This may include (without limitation) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; a sound recording or cinematograph film; a published edition of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or a television or sound broadcast.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights
Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions under copyright law or any other applicable laws.
3. Licence Grant
3A Grant of Rights
Provided that the terms set out in this Licence are satisfied, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the following rights:
Reproduce the Work;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any Collection; and
Distribute and publicly perform the Work or the Work as incorporated in any Collection.
3B Media, Formats and No Derivative Works
The above rights may be exercised in any media or format whether now known or hereafter created. They include the right to make modifications that are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Other than such technical modifications, You have no rights to make Derivative Works.
3C Other Rights Reserved
All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
4. Restrictions
The licence granted above is limited by the following restrictions.
4A Restrictions on Distribution and Public Performance of the Work
You may Distribute and publicly perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
You are not granted the right to sublicense the Work. The rights of recipients of the Work from You are governed by clause 9.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, You must not impose any technological measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other material within the Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work itself, to be made subject to this Licence.
4B Attribution and Notice Requirements
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Collection You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Collection You must provide, in a manner reasonable to the medium or means You are using:
the name or pseudonym (if provided) of the Original Author and/or of any other party (such as a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal) that the Original Author or Licensor has requested be attributed (such as in the copyright notice or terms of use). In this clause 4B these parties are referred to as "Attribution Parties";
the title of the Work (if provided); and
to the extent reasonably practicable, any Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) that the Licensor specifies should be associated with the Work that refers to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
In the case of a Collection, the above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part of any credits for other contributing authors and be as prominent as the credits for those other authors.
You must, to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any Collection if requested to do so by the Licensor or Original Author.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this clause 4B for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above. By exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must not assert or imply:
any connection between the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party and You or Your use of the Work; or
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party of You or Your use of the Work,
without their separate, express prior written permission.
4C Moral Rights
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4C, "moral rights" means the personal rights granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have authorship falsely attributed.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Work "as-is" and makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, any representations, warranties or conditions regarding:
the contents or accuracy of the Work;
title, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose;
non-infringement;
the absence of latent or other defects; or
the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, imply certain warranties and conditions in certain circumstances, such as the right to supply or fitness for purpose of goods or services supplied to a consumer. Clause 5(a) cannot and is not intended to exclude, restrict or modify these warranties.
6. Limit of Liability
To the full extent permitted by applicable law, and except for any liability arising from contrary agreement, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal basis (including without limitation, negligence) for any loss or damage whatsoever, including (without limitation):
loss of production or operation time, loss, damage or corruption of data or records; or
loss of anticipated savings, opportunity, revenue, profit or goodwill, or other economic loss; or
any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Licence or the use of the Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
If applicable legislation implies warranties or conditions, or imposes obligations or liability on the Licensor in respect of this Licence that cannot be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified, the Licensor’s liability is limited, to the full extent permitted by the applicable legislation, at its option, to:
in the case of goods, any one or more of the following:
the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
the repair of the goods;
the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;
the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
in the case of services:
the supplying of the services again; or
the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, restrict the limitation of liability in certain circumstances, such as a contract for the supply of goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic, or household use. Clauses 6(a) and 6(b) cannot and are not intended to apply in circumstances where it is prohibited by law.
7. Termination
This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals or entities who have received a Collection from You pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided they remain in full compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of this Licence.
8. Licensor’s Rights Retained
Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such release will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work from You
Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or a Collection the Licensor offers the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms as are granted to You under this Licence.
10. Severability
If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence. Without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
11. Waivers and Consents
No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the relevant party.
12. Entire Agreement
This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. To the full extent permitted by law, there are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may not be modified without the written agreement of the Licensor and You.
13. Governing Law
The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by the laws in force in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.

Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

4. Restrições. A licença concedida na Seção 3 acima está expressamente sujeita e limitada pelas seguintes restrições:
Você pode Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra apenas sob os termos desta Licença, e Você deve incluir uma cópia desta Licença ou o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (Uniform Resource Identifier) para esta Licença em cada cópia da Obra que Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente. Você não poderá oferecer ou impor quaisquer termos sobre a Obra que restrinjam os termos desta Licença ou a habilidade do destinatário exercer os direitos a ele aqui concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. Você não pode sublicenciar a Obra. Você deverá manter intactas todas as informações que se referem a esta Licença e à exclusão de garantias em toda cópia da Obra que Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente. Quando Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra, Você não poderá impor qualquer medida tecnológica eficaz à Obra que restrinja a possibilidade do destinatário exercer os direitos concedidos a ele sob os termos desta Licença. Esta Seção 4(a) se aplica à Obra enquanto quando incorporada em uma Obra Coletiva, mas isto não requer que a Obra Coletiva, à parte da Obra em si, esteja sujeita aos termos desta Licença. Se Você criar uma Obra Coletiva, em havendo notificação de qualquer Licenciante, Você deve, na medida do razoável, remover da Obra Coletiva qualquer crédito, conforme estipulado na Seção 4(b), quando solicitado.
Se Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra ou Obra Coletiva, Você deve, a menos que um pedido relacionado à Seção 4(a) tenha sido feito, manter intactas todas as informações relativas a direitos autorais sobre a Obra e exibir, de forma razoável em relação ao meio ou mídia por Você utilizado: (i) o nome do Autor Original (ou seu pseudônimo, se for o caso), se fornecido, do Titular de Direitos Conexos, se fornecido e quando aplicável, e/ou, ainda, se o Autor Original/Titular de Direitos Conexos e/ou o Licenciante designar outra parte ou partes (p. ex.: um instituto patrocinador, editora, periódico) para atribuição (“Partes de Atribuição”) nas informações relativas aos direitos autorais do Licenciante, termos de serviço ou por outros meios razoáveis, o nome dessa parte ou partes; (ii) o título da Obra, se fornecido; (iii) na medida do razoável, o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante especificar para estar associado à Obra, se houver, exceto se o URI não se referir ao aviso de direitos autorais ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento da Obra. O crédito exigido por esta Seção 4(b), pode ser implementado de qualquer forma razoável; desde que, entretanto, no caso de uma Obra Coletiva, na indicação de crédito feita aos autores participantes da Obra Coletiva, o crédito apareça como parte dessa indicação, e de modo ao menos tão proeminente quanto os créditos para os outros autores participantes. De modo a evitar dúvidas, Você apenas poderá fazer uso do crédito exigido por esta Seção para o propósito de atribuição na forma estabelecida acima e, ao exercer Seus direitos sob esta Licença, Você não poderá implícita ou explicitamente afirmar ou sugerir qualquer vínculo, patrocínio ou apoio do Autor Original, Titular de Direitos Conexos, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição, o que for cabível, por Você ou Seu uso da Obra, sem a prévia e expressa autorização do Autor Original, Titular de Direitos Conexos, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição.
Na extensão em que reconhecidos e considerados indisponíveis pela legislação aplicável, direitos morais não são afetados por esta Licença.
5. Declarações, garantias e exoneração.

6. Limitação de responsabilidade. EXCETO NA EXTENSÃO EXIGIDA PELA LEI APLICÁVEL, EM NENHUMA CIRCUNSTÂNCIA O LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PARA COM VOCÊ POR QUAISQUER DANOS, ESPECIAIS, INCIDENTAIS, CONSEQÜENCIAIS, PUNITIVOS OU EXEMPLARES, ORIUNDOS DESTA LICENÇA OU DO USO DA OBRA, MESMO QUE O LICENCIANTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO SOBRE A POSSIBILIDADE DE TAIS DANOS.
7. Terminação.
Esta Licença e os direitos aqui concedidos terminarão automaticamente no caso de qualquer violação dos termos desta Licença por Você. Pessoas físicas ou jurídicas que tenham recebido Obras Coletivas de Você sob esta Licença, entretanto, não terão suas licenças terminadas desde que tais pessoas físicas ou jurídicas permaneçam em total cumprimento com essas licenças. As Seções 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 subsistirão a qualquer terminação desta Licença.
Sujeito aos termos e condições dispostos acima, a licença aqui concedida é perpétua (pela duração do direito autoral aplicável à Obra). Não obstante o disposto acima, o Licenciante reserva-se o direito de difundir a Obra sob termos diferentes de licença ou de cessar a distribuição da Obra a qualquer momento; desde que, no entanto, quaisquer destas ações não sirvam como meio de retratação desta Licença (ou de qualquer outra licença que tenha sido concedida sob os termos desta Licença, ou que deva ser concedida sob os termos desta Licença) e esta Licença continuará válida e eficaz a não ser que seja terminada de acordo com o disposto acima.
8. Outras disposições
Cada vez que Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra ou uma Obra Coletiva, o Licenciante oferece ao destinatário uma licença da Obra nos mesmos termos e condições que a licença concedida a Você sob esta Licença.
Se qualquer disposição desta Licença for tida como inválida ou não-executável sob a lei aplicável, isto não afetará a validade ou a possibilidade de execução do restante dos termos desta Licença e, sem a necessidade de qualquer ação adicional das partes deste acordo, tal disposição será reformada na mínima extensão necessária para tal disposição tornar-se válida e executável.
Nenhum termo ou disposição desta Licença será considerado renunciado e nenhuma violação será considerada consentida, a não ser que tal renúncia ou consentimento seja feito por escrito e assinado pela parte que será afetada por tal renúncia ou consentimento.
Esta Licença representa o acordo integral entre as partes com respeito à Obra aqui licenciada. Não há entendimentos, acordos ou declarações relativas à Obra que não estejam especificados aqui. O Licenciante não será obrigado por nenhuma disposição adicional que possa aparecer em quaisquer comunicações provenientes de Você. Esta Licença não pode ser modificada sem o mútuo acordo, por escrito, entre o Licenciante e Você.

DIE VERBREITUNG DIESER LIZENZ FÜHRT NICHT ZU EINEM MANDATSVERHÄLTNIS DES EMPFÄNGERS MIT CREATIVE COMMONS. CREATIVE COMMONS ÜBERNIMMT KEINE GEWÄHR FÜR DIE ZUR VERFÜGUNG GESTELLTEN INFORMATIONEN UND LEHNT JEGLICHE HAFTUNG FÜR SCHÄDEN AB, DIE AUS DEM GEBRAUCH DIESER INFORMATIONEN ERWACHSEN. DIESER AUSSCHLUSS VON GEWÄHRLEISTUNG UND HAFTUNG ERSTRECKT SICH AUCH AUF DIE PERSONEN, DIE AN DER ADAPTIERUNG DES VORLIEGENDEN LIZENZTEXTS ANS SCHWEIZERISCHE RECHT MITGEWIRKT HABEN.
Lizenz
Durch die Ausübung eines durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechts an dem Lizenzgegenstand erklären Sie sich mit den Lizenzbedingungen rechtsverbindlich einverstanden. Soweit diese Lizenz als Vertrag anzusehen ist, gewährt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber die in der Lizenz genannten Rechte unentgeltlich und im Austausch dafür, dass Sie das Gebundensein an die Lizenzbedingungen akzeptieren.
Der „Lizenzgeber“, d.h. die Person, welche den Lizenzgegenstand unter dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung stellt,  und  „Sie“, d.h. die natürliche oder juristische Person, welche die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannten Nutzungen des Lizenzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand nicht gegen die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstossen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstosses auszuüben,  vereinbaren mit dieser Creative Commons Public License („CCPL“ oder „Lizenz“) die Nutzungsbedingungen für den Lizenzgegenstand,  im Einzelnen:
1. Definitionen
„Lizenzgegenstand“ kann ein urheberrechtlich geschütztes Werk sein oder eine durch verwandte Schutzrechte geschützte Leistung.
Eine „Sammlung“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist eine Zusammenstellung des Lizenzgegenstands mit anderen Werken oder sonstigen Elementen, unabhängig davon, ob an der Sammlung selbst aufgrund der Anordnung oder der Auswahl des Inhalts ein Urheberrecht entsteht. Als Sammlung gelten auch Datenbanken, unabhängig davon, ob an der Datenbank selbst aufgrund der Anordnung oder der Auswahl des Inhalts ein Urheberrecht entsteht. Die Aufnahme des Lizenzgegenstandes in eine Sammlung gilt nicht als Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes.
Eine „Abwandlung“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist jede Veränderung des Lizenzgegenstandes, insbesondere eine Umgestaltung, Bearbeitung, Änderung, Anpassung oder Übersetzung, solange der Lizenzgegenstand in seinem individuellen Charakter erkennbar bleibt. Nicht als Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes gilt seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung.
„Rechteinhaber“ ist der Urheber des Lizenzgegenstandes, der Inhaber verwandter Schutzrechte oder jede andere Person, die am Lizenzgegenstand Nutzungsrechte erlangt hat, welche die Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder die Weiterübertragung der Nutzungsrechte an Dritte erlauben.
Ein „Werk“ ist eine geistige Schöpfung mit individuellem Charakter.
Ein „verwandtes Schutzrecht“ ist ein Recht an einer kulturellen Leistung, welche nicht als Werk geschützt ist, wie etwa jene von ausübenden Künstlern, Herstellern von Ton- und Tonbildträgern oder Sendeunternehmen.
„Öffentlich Wiedergeben“ ist das Vortragen des Lizenzgegenstandes direkt oder mit irgendwelchen Mitteln, das Aufführen, das Vorführen, das anderswo Wahrnehmbarmachen oder das Zugänglichmachen in der Weise, dass Personen von Orten und zu Zeiten ihrer Wahl dazu Zugang haben.
„Vervielfältigen“ bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren vorübergehende oder dauerhafte Vervielfältigungsstücke des Lizenzgegenstandes herzustellen und umfasst auch den Vorgang der erstmaligen körperlichen Fixierungen des Lizenzgegenstandes und der Herstellung von Vervielfältigungen dieser Fixierungen sowie die Übertragung des Lizenzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleich ob in digitaler oder analoger Form.
„Verbreiten“ bedeutet, den Lizenzgegenstand im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
2. Schranken des Urheberrechts
Dieser Lizenzvertrag lässt sämtliche Befugnisse unberührt, die sich aufgrund der Beschränkungen der ausschliesslichen Rechte des Rechteinhabers durch das Urheberrechtsgesetz (Eigengebrauch, Erschöpfungsgrundsatz etc.) oder durch andere Bestimmungen der anwendbaren Gesetzgebung ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung
Unter den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber die Befugnis ein, den Lizenzgegenstand weltweit, lizenzgebührenfrei, nicht exklusiv und zeitlich unbeschränkt (d.h. für die Schutzdauer des Werks oder des verwandten Schutzrechts) wie folgt zu nutzen:
den Lizenzgegenstand zu vervielfältigen, ihn in eine oder mehrere Sammlungen aufzunehmen und ihn im Rahmen der Sammlung zu vervielfältigen;
den Lizenzgegenstand oder Vervielfältigungen davon zu verbreiten, öffentlich wiederzugeben, durch Radio, Fernsehen oder ähnliche Einrichtungen, auch über Leitungen, zu senden, weiterzusenden oder sonstwie wahrnehmbar zu machen, wobei sich diese Befugnisse auch auf den in eine Sammlung aufgenommenen Lizenzgegenstand erstrecken.
bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche als Gegenleistung für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschliessliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen ausserhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.
Die vorstehend genannten Befugnisse können für alle Nutzungsarten sowie in jedem Medium und Format ausgeübt werden, ob diese bereits bekannt sind oder erst in Zukunft entwickelt werden. Diese Befugnisse umfassen auch das Recht zu Änderungen, die technisch notwendig sind, um die Befugnisse in anderen Medien und Formaten auszuüben. Darüber hinaus dürfen jedoch keine Änderungen vorgenommen werden.
4. Bedingungen
Die in Ziffer 3 eingeräumten Befugnisse unterliegen den folgenden Bedingungen:
Bei jeder Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz müssen Sie eine Kopie dieser Lizenz mitgeben. Sie können hiervon absehen, wenn Sie an Stelle dieser Lizenz die jedermann zugängliche Fundstelle dieser Lizenz bekannt geben (Uniform Resource Identifier, URI). Sie müssen bei der Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz alle Hinweise auf diese Lizenz und auf ihre Klauseln betreffend Gewährleistungs- und Haftungsausschluss beibehalten. Sie dürfen keine Vereinbarungen treffen, welche die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verschärfen oder die mit dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte für einen Dritten einschränken. Sie dürfen für den Lizenzgegenstand keine Unterlizenz erteilen. Sie dürfen den Lizenzgegenstand nicht mit technischen Schutzmassnahmen versehen, die den Nutzer des Lizenzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können.  Ziffer 4 Buchstabe a gilt auch, falls der Lizenzgegenstand Bestandteil einer Sammlung ist. Dies bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass die Sammlung als solche diesen Lizenzbestimmungen unterstellt werden muss.  Wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand in eine Sammlung aufnehmen, müssen Sie auf Aufforderung des Urhebers oder jedes Lizenzgebers hin jeden Hinweis auf den Auffordernden soweit machbar und gewünscht aus der Sammlung entfernen; soweit Hinweise gestützt auf eine solche Aufforderung zu entfernen sind, entfallen die Pflichten gemäss Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b.
Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstands, sei es isoliert oder als Teil einer Sammlung, müssen Sie die bestehenden Copyright-Vermerke vollständig beibehalten bzw. in einem Rahmen wiedergeben, der dem technischen Verfahren und dem Trägermedium der von Ihnen vorgenommenen Nutzung angemessen ist, ausgenommen, es liegt eine Aufforderung zur Entfernung der Angaben gemäss Ziffer 4 Buchstabe a Absatz 3 vor.
Insbesondere müssen Sie (i) den Namen (oder das Pseudonym) des Urhebers sowie den Namen von Dritten nennen, die ein Rechteinhaber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen hat.
Ist Ihnen (ii) der Titel des Lizenzgegenstands bekannt, müssen Sie diesen angeben.
Hat der Lizenzgeber (iii) eine Internetadresse angegeben (z.B. in Form des Uniform Resource Identifier, URI), welche Lizenzinformationen oder Copyright-Vermerke enthält, müssen Sie diese ebenfalls nennen, soweit dies mit angemessenem Aufwand durchführbar ist.
Die gemäss dieser Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b vorgeschriebenen Hinweise können in jeder angemessenen Weise erfolgen. Bei Sammlungen müssen solche Hinweise hinsichtlich Plazierung und Ausgestaltung mindestens ebenso auffällig und in vergleichbarer Weise ausgeführt werden, wie dies für die anderen Rechteinhaber erfolgte, sofern ein solcher Hinweis für alle beitragenden Lizenzgeber erscheint.  Zur Klarstellung: Die gemäss dieser Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b vorgeschriebenen Hinweise dürfen ausschliesslich in der in diesem Abschnitt beschriebenen Weise und zum Zweck der Zurechnung des Werks zum Urheber, Lizenzgeber bzw. zu Dritten, die ein Urheber bzw. Lizenzgeber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen hat, verwendet werden. Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes dürfen Sie weder implizit noch explizit den Eindruck einer Unterstützung oder Billigung durch diese Personen oder den Eindruck einer sonstigen Verbindung zwischen Ihnen und diesen Personen erwecken, ohne zuvor eine separate schriftliche Einwilligung von den betroffenen Personen eingeholt zu haben.
Ihre Befugnis, den Lizenzgegenstand zu nutzen, findet ihre gesetzliche Grenze in den (Urheber-) Persönlichkeitsrechten des Rechteinhabers, dessen berechtigte geistige und persönliche Interessen bzw. dessen Ansehen oder Ruf durch die Nutzung ohne eine zuvor eingeholte separate schriftliche Einwilligung der betroffenen Personen nicht beeinträchtigt werden dürfen.
5. Keine Gewährleistung
SOFERN VOM LIZENZGEBER NICHT SCHRIFTLICH ANDERS ANERKANNT, ÜBERNIMMT DER LIZENZGEBER KEINE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG FÜR DIE ERTEILTEN BEFUGNISSE.
6. Haftungsausschluss
ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER 5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER NUR FÜR VORSATZ UND GROBE FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT. JEDE ANDERE HAFTUNG IST AUSGESCHLOSSEN, SOWEIT GESETZLICH ZULÄSSIG. FÜR SEINE HILFSPERSONEN HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER IN KEINEM FALL. DIESER HAFTUNGSAUSSCHLUSS GILT AUCH DANN, WENN SIE AUF DIE MÖGLICHKEIT EINER SCHÄDIGUNG HINGEWIESEN HABEN.
7. Beendigung
Diese Lizenz und die darunter eingeräumten Befugnisse fallen ohne weiteres und mit sofortiger Wirkung dahin, wenn Sie die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verletzen. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die den Lizenzgegenstand enthaltende Sammlungen unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 und 8 bleiben ungeachtet der Beendigung dieser Lizenz verbindlich.
Die mit dieser Lizenz eingeräumten Befugnisse werden zeitlich uneingeschränkt eingeräumt (freilich höchstens für die Dauer, für welche der Lizenzgegenstand nach dem anwendbaren Recht urheber- bzw. leistungsschutzrechtlich geschützt ist). Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch für einen beliebigen Zeitpunkt das Recht vor, den Lizenzgegenstand unter einer anderen Lizenz weiterzugeben oder die Verbreitung des Lizenzgegenstands ganz zu beenden. Der Lizenzwechsel wird jedoch nicht die Wirkung eines Widerrufs dieser Lizenz haben (oder jeder anderen Lizenzierung, die auf der Grundlage dieser Lizenz erfolgt oder erfolgen muss), vielmehr wird die Lizenz so lange weiter bestehen, als sie nicht nach Ziffer 7 Buchstabe a vorstehend beendigt wurde.
8. Verschiedenes
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand oder eine Sammlung gestützt auf Ziffer 3 dieser Lizenz nutzen, räumt der Lizenzgeber auch dem Empfänger eines allfälligen Vervielfältigungsstücks eine Lizenz am Lizenzgegenstand selber ein, und zwar zu denselben Bedingungen wie die Ihnen eingeräumte Lizenz.
Sollten sich einzelne Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz nach dem anwendbaren Recht als nicht durchsetzbar oder nichtig erweisen, so bleiben die übrigen Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz gültig und durchsetzbar und an die Stelle der unwirksamen Bestimmung tritt eine Ersatzregelung, die dem mit der unwirksamen Bestimmung angestrebten Zweck am nächsten kommt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz gilt als wegbedungen und keine Verletzung als genehmigt, bevor nicht die durch die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung belastete Partei die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung in Schriftform und unterschriftlich bestätigt hat.
Diese Lizenz enthält alle mit Blick auf den Lizenzgegenstand zwischen den Parteien massgeblichen Bestimmungen. Andere Vertrauenspositionen, Abreden oder Zusicherungen im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand bestehen nicht. Der Lizenzgeber ist durch keine zusätzliche Klausel gebunden, welche sich aus irgendwelchen Unterlagen von Ihnen ergibt. Diese Vereinbarung kann ohne vorherige Vereinbarung mit unterschriftlicher Bestätigung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen nicht abgeändert werden.
Creative Commons Hinweis

Creative Commons haftet nicht für Ihnen entstandene Schäden aus der Verwendung des Lizenzgegenstands oder dieser Lizenz, aus welchem Rechtsgrund sie auch abgeleitet werden, sei es für direkten, indirekten Schaden oder für Folgeschaden. Ungeachtet des vorstehenden Satzes hat Creative Commons alle Rechte aus dieser Lizenz, sofern sie bezüglich eines Werks ausdrücklich selber als Lizenzgeberin unter dieser Lizenz auftritt.
Ausser für den begrenzten Zweck, dem Publikum öffentlich bekannt zu machen, dass der Lizenzgegenstand unter der CCPL lizenziert ist, erlaubt Creative Commons den Parteien dieser Lizenz nicht, das Markenzeichen "Creative Commons" oder irgend ein anderes Markenzeichen oder Logo von Creative Commons ohne die vorgängige schriftliche Zustimmung von Creative Commons zu verwenden.

LA SOCIÉTÉ CREATIVE COMMONS N'EST PAS UNE ÉTUDE D'AVOCATS ET NE FOURNIT PAS DE CONSEILS OU DE SERVICES JURIDIQUES. LA DISTRIBUTION DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE NE CRÉE AUCUN MANDAT ENTRE SON UTILISATEUR ET CREATIVE COMMONS. CREATIVE COMMONS LIVRE CES INFORMATION « TEL QUEL » ET NE FOURNIT AUCUNE GARANTIE EN RELATION AVEC CETTE LICENCE ET LES INFORMATIONS QU’ELLE CONTIENT ET SE DÉCHARGE DE TOUTE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR TOUT DOMMAGE POUVANT RÉSULTER DE SON UTILISATION. CETTE LIMITATION DE RESPONSABILITÉ S’ÉTEND ÉGALEMENT AUX PERSONNES QUI ONT PARTICIPÉ À L’ADAPTATION DE LA LICENCE AU DROIT SUISSE.
Licence
En exerçant l’un des droits concernés par cette licence, Vous acceptez que les termes de la présente licence soient juridiquement contraignantes. Pour autant que la présente licence puisse être considérée comme un contrat, le donneur de licence Vous autorise à utiliser sans contrepartie les droits figurant dans cette licence à condition que vous acceptiez de Vous conformer strictement à ses termes.
Le « Donneur de licence », à savoir la personne qui met l’Objet de la Licence à disposition aux conditions qu’elle contient,  et  « Vous », à savoir la personne physique ou morale, qui utilisez, au sens de l’article 3 de la présente Licence, l’Objet de la Licence conformément aux termes de la présente Licence acceptez, sous réserve d’une autorisation expresse du Donneur de licence de Vous en écarter, de Vous conformer strictement aux conditions d’utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence contenues dans la présente Licence indépendamment de toute utilisation contraire qui aurait pu en être faite par le passé :
1. Définitions
L’ « Objet de la licence » peut être une Œuvre protégée par le droit d’auteur ou une prestation protégée par des droits voisins.
Un « Recueil » au sens de la présente Licence est une compilation de l’Objet de la licence avec d'autres œuvres ou d'autres éléments, indépendamment du fait que le Recueil en tant que tel jouisse d’un droit d’auteur en raison du choix ou de la disposition de son contenu. Par « Recueil », il faut entendre les bases de données, indépendamment du fait qu’elles jouissent d’un droit d’auteur en raison du choix ou de la disposition de leur contenu. Le fait d’incorporer l’Objet de la licence dans un Recueil n’équivaut pas à une Modification de l'Objet de licence.
Une « Modification » au sens de la présente Licence signifie tout changement de l’Objet de la licence, en particulier, toute transformation, œuvre dérivée, modification, adaptation ou traduction, aussi longtemps que le caractère unique de l’Objet de licence demeure reconnaissable. Le fait d’incorporer l’Object de la licence dans un Recueil n’équivaut pas à une Modification.
« Titulaire des droits » comprend l'auteur de l’Objet de la licence, les titulaires de droits voisins, ou toute autre personne ayant acquis des droits en relation avec l’Objet de la licence et qui est autorisée à accorder des licences ou sous-licences à des tiers.
Une « Œuvre » est une création de l’esprit, littéraire ou artistique, qui a un caractère individuel.
Un « Droit voisin » est un droit relatif à une prestation culturelle, qui n'est pas protégé en tant qu'Œuvre, tels que ceux des artistes interprètes, producteurs de phonogrammes et de vidéogrammes et des organismes de radiodiffusion.
« Représentation publique » est la représentation, la récitation, la projection ou la mise à disposition de l’Objet de la licence directement ou par tout autre moyen permettant aux personnes présentes en un lieu et à un moment donné d’y avoir accès.
« Reproduire » signifie une reproduction de l’Objet de la licence en utilisant n'importe quel moyen de reproduction temporaire ou permanent, y compris l'exploitation de la première fixation physique de l'Objet de la licence et la production de copies de cette fixation ainsi que le transfert de l’Objet de la licence sur tout support visuel ou sonore ou tout autre support électronique, que ce soit sous forme numérique ou analogique.
« Diffuser » signifie mettre à disposition du public ou mettre en circulation l’Objet de la licence ou des Modifications sous forme originale ou sous forme de reproductions physiques.
2. Restrictions du droit d’auteur
La présente Licence n’a pas pour effet de limiter les droits découlant des restrictions au droit d'auteur (utilisation à des fins privées, principe de l'épuisement, etc.) ou d'autres lois applicables.
3. Licences
En vertu des termes de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence Vous accorde le droit non exclusif d’utiliser l’Objet de la licence dans le monde entier, libre de redevance, pour une durée indéterminée (pour la durée de la protection de l’Œuvre par le droit d’auteur ou les droits voisins) comme suit :
Reproduire l’Objet de la Licence, l’incorporer dans un Recueil et le reproduire une fois incorporé dans le Recueil.
Diffuser ou rendre accessible au public l’Objet de la licence ou des copies de celui-ci, que ce soit par le biais de la radio, la télévision ou de toute installation similaire, y compris par le câble, permettant de le diffuser, de le rediffuser ou de le rendre perceptible de toute autre manière, étant précisé que ces prérogatives s'étendent aux Recueils lorsque l’Objet de la licence y est incorporé.
La rémunération pour l'utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence est soumise aux principes suivants :
Système de rémunération légale obligatoire : dans les cas où il existe un système de rémunération légale obligatoire en échange de licences légales ou un système de redevance forfaitaire (par exemple, pour les supports vierges), le Donneur de licence se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances pour chacune des utilisations que Vous faites d’un droit faisant l’objet de cette Licence ;
Système de rémunération lié à l’octroi de licences obligatoires : dans les cas où des licences obligatoires n’étant pas comprises dans cette Licence entrent en considération, le Donneur de licence renonce à toute rémunération pour toute utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence que Vous seriez amené à faire en vertu d’une licence obligatoire ;
Autres cas de rémunération : le Donneur de licence renonce à toute rémunération pour toute utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence conformément aux termes de celle-ci et qui ne tombe pas sous le coup des deux sections précédentes (i) et (ii), indépendamment du fait que la collecte des droits d’auteur puisse se faire par le Donneur de licence lui-même ou doive impérativement passer par une société de gestion.
Les prérogatives figurant ci-dessus valent pour tous types d'utilisation et tous types de médias ou de formats connus ou futurs. Ces prérogatives comprennent le droit d'apporter des modifications qui sont techniquement nécessaires pour pouvoir les exercer sur d’autres supports ou dans d’autres formats. Au-delà de ça, toute Modification de l’Objet de la Licence est exclue.
4. Conditions
Les autorisations accordées au chiffre 3 ci-dessus sont soumises aux conditions suivantes :
Pour chaque exercice d’un droit conféré par cette Licence, Vous devez remettre une copie de cette Licence. Vous pouvez y renoncer si Vous la rendez accessible à quiconque sous la forme d’un « Uniform Resource Identifier » (ci-après : « URI »). Lorsque Vous exercez un droit en vertu de la présente Licence, Vous devez maintenir toutes les références à cette Licence et aux clauses d’exclusion de garantie et de responsabilité. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à conclure un accord qui durcirait les conditions de la présente Licence ou qui soumettrait les droits garantis par cette Licence à des restrictions vis-à-vis des tiers. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à accorder des sous-licences en relation avec l’Objet de la Licence. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à soumettre l’Objet de la Licence à des mesures de protection techniques qui empêcheraient ses utilisateurs d’exercer les droits garantis par la présente Licence.  La présente disposition (article 4 let. a) s’applique également dans les cas où l’Objet de la Licence est incorporé à un Recueil, indépendamment du fait que ledit Recueil soit en tant que tel soumis aux conditions de la présente Licence.  Lorsque Vous incorporez l’Objet de la Licence dans un Recueil, Vous devez, à la requête du Titulaire des droits ou de tout Donneur de licence et dans la mesure du possible, retirer du Recueil toute référence au requérant ; dès lors que les références sont retirées sur la base d’une telle requête, les obligations de l’article 4 let. b sont applicables.
Pour chaque diffusion, mise à disposition du public de l’Objet de la Licence, que ce soit de manière individuelle ou dans le cadre d’un Recueil, Vous devez, à moins qu’une requête au sens de l’article 4 let. a ne Vous ait été adressée, faire en sorte que toutes les mentions légales relatives au droit d’auteur en relation avec l’Objet de la Licence demeurent intactes et faire en sorte, dans les limites des moyens techniques et des supports que Vous utilisez, que les indications suivantes figurent dans la mention légale relative au droit d’auteur :
Nom de l’auteur original (ou, le cas échéant, son pseudonyme) ou le nom de tiers figurant dans la mention légale initiale ;
Le titre de l’Œuvre, pour autant qu’il Vous soit connu ;
L’adresse internet (par exemple sous la forme d’Uniform Resource Identifier, URI) qui contient les informations relatives à la Licence ou la mention légale relative au droit d’auteur pour autant que cela puisse raisonnablement être mis en œuvre.
Les mentions légales requises par l’article 4 let. b peuvent être indiquées de toute manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas de Recueils, s’il figure une mention légale pour tous les auteurs ayant contribué au Recueil, alors la mention légale pour chacun des auteurs doit être au minimum d’une importance comparable à celle des autres auteurs ayant participé au Recueil.  Pour clarification : les mentions légales requises par cet article 4 let. b ne peuvent être utilisées que pour attribuer la paternité de l’Œuvre conformément aux obligations contenues dans la présente Licence, et, en exerçant Vos droits dans le cadre de la présente Licence, Vous n’êtes pas autorisé à prétendre de manière directe ou indirecte ou à laisser penser qu’il existe un parrainage entre Vous et l’auteur original, le Donneur de licence et/ou les auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre avec Vous ou que l’auteur original, le Donneur de licence et/ou les auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre avec Vous approuvent votre travail ou l’utilisation que Vous faites de l’Œuvre sans autorisation séparée, expresse et préalable de l’auteur original, du Donneur de licence ou des auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre.
Votre possibilité d’utiliser l’Objet de la Licence trouve ses limites dans les droits de la personnalité et les droits moraux du Titulaire des droits, lequel a le droit à ce que son intégrité intellectuelle et personnelle, ainsi que son honneur et sa réputation ne soient pas atteints sans une autorisation écrite préalable séparée.
5. Exclusion de garantie
A MOINS D’UN ENGAGEMENT ÉCRIT CONTRAIRE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE DONNE AUCUNE GARANTIE EN RELATION AVEC LES PRÉROGATIVES ACCORDÉES EN VERTU DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE.
6. Limitation de responsabilité
LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE RÉPOND QUE DES DOMMAGES INTENTIONNELS OU RÉSULTANT DE SA NÉGLIGENCE GRAVE EN RELATION AVEC LES GARANTIES DONNÉES EN VERTU DE L’ARTICLE 5. TOUTE AUTRE RESPONSABILITÉ DU DONNEUR DE LICENCE EST EXCLUE, POUR AUTANT QUE CELA SOIT LICITE. LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE RÉPOND EN AUCUN CAS DE SES AUXILIAIRES. LA PRÉSENTE EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ EST ÉGALEMENT APPLICABLE DANS LES CAS OÙ VOUS AURIEZ ÉTÉ AVISÉ DE LA POSSIBILITÉ D’UN DÉDOMMAGEMENT.
7. Résiliation
Cette Licence - et les droits qu’elle contient – prendra fin automatiquement et avec effet immédiat en cas de violation de l’un de ses termes. Les personnes physiques et morales qui ont reçu des Recueils de votre part sur la base de cette Licence pourront néanmoins continuer à les utiliser sur la base de leurs licences, pour autant, toutefois, que ces personnes physiques ou morales se conforment strictement aux termes de ces licences. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 resteront en vigueur en cas de résiliation de cette Licence.
Les droits accordés par la présente Licence sont accordés pour une durée indéterminée (pour la durée de protection de l’Objet de la Licence en vertu du droit applicable en matière de droit d’auteur ou de droits voisins) aux conditions contenues dans la présente Licence. Nonobstant ce qui précède, le droit du Donneur de licence de publier l’Œuvre sous d’autres termes contractuels ou d’arrêter de diffuser l’Œuvre à tout moment est réservé, à condition, toutefois, que cette décision n’ait pas pour effet d’annuler la présente Licence (ou toute licence qui a été, ou qui doit être accordée sur la base de cette Licence), étant précisé que dans ce cas de figure la présente Licence restera en vigueur jusqu’à sa résiliation conformément à ce qui précède.
8. Divers
Chaque fois que Vous utilisez l’Objet de la Licence ou un Recueil conformément à l’article 3 de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence accorde au destinataire de l’Objet de la Licence ou du Recueil une licence semblable à celle-ci, aux mêmes conditions, valant pour l’utilisation de l’Œuvre.
Dans l’hypothèse où une disposition contenue dans la présente Licence devait être considérée comme nulle ou ne pourrait être exécutée en vertu du droit applicable, les autres dispositions de la présente Licence demeureraient pleinement valables et exécutoires et la disposition inefficace devrait être remplacée par une disposition conforme au but recherché par la présente Licence.
Aucune renonciation des termes ou dispositions de la présente Licence ne pourra être acceptée et aucune violation ne pourra être consentie sans l’accord écrit et signé par la partie concernée par cette renonciation ou ce consentement.
La présente Licence constitue le seul accord entre les parties à propos de l’Objet de la Licence. Il n'existe aucun accord ou garantie portant sur l’Objet de la Licence en dehors des éléments mentionnés ici. Le Donneur de licence ne sera tenu par aucune disposition complémentaire qui pourrait figurer dans une communication de Votre part. Cette Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord mutuel écrit des Parties.
Note Creative Commons
Creative Commons n'est pas partie à la présente Licence et ne donne aucune garantie quant à l’Objet sous Licence. Creative Commons ne peut être tenue responsable envers Vous ou toute partie sur la base d’aucune théorie juridique pour tout dommage, que ce soit pour des dommages directs, des indirects ou consécutifs survenus en relation avec cette Licence. Nonobstant les deux (2) phrases précédentes, si Creative Commons a expressément reconnu agir comme Donneur de Licence, elle répondra vis-à-vis de Vous de la même manière que le Donneur de Licence.
Creative Commons n’autorise aucune partie à utiliser la marque « Creative Commons » ou toute autre marque ou logo de Creative Commons sans l'accord préalable écrit de Creative Commons, sauf pour indiquer au public que l’Œuvre est mise à disposition sous licence CCPL. Toute utilisation autorisée devra être effectuée en conformité avec les lignes directrices de Creative Commons en vigueur au moment de l'utilisation, dans leur version disponible sur son site Internet ou sur simple demande.

LA OBRA (TAL Y COMO SE DEFINE MÁS ADELANTE) SE OTORGA BAJO ESTA LICENCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS ("LPCC" O "LICENCIA"). LA OBRA ESTÁ PROTEGIDA POR DERECHOS DE AUTOR Y/U OTRAS LEYES APLICABLES. QUEDA PROHIBIDO CUALQUIER OTRO USO QUE SE HAGA DE LA OBRA QUE NO CUENTE CON LA AUTORIZACIÓN PERTINENTE DE CONFORMIDAD CON LOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTA LICENCIA Y DE LA LEY SOBRE DERECHOS DE AUTOR.

1. Definiciones

ALGUNAS LEYES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE CIERTA RESPONSABILIDAD, EN CUYO CASO ESTA EXCLUSIÓN PUEDE NO APLICARSE A USTED.
7. Término
Esta Licencia y los derechos otorgados en virtud de ella terminarán automáticamente si Usted infringe alguna condición establecida en ella.

协议文本
本作品（定义如下）的提供是以适用“知识共享公共许可协议”（ 简称“CCPL”或 “许可”）为前提的。本作品受《中华人民共和国著作权法》以及其他可适用法律的保护。对本作品的使用不得超越本许可协议授权的范围。

第三条 授权
根据本许可的条款和条件，许可人在此授予您全球性、免版税、非独占并且在本作品的著作权存续期间内均有效的许可，就本作品行使以下权利：
复制本作品或将本作品收入一个或多个汇编作品中，以及复制汇编作品中收录的本作品；
发行、公开传播本作品（包括汇编作品中收录的本作品）；
为避免疑义，针对不同司法管辖区的著作权许可体系作出如下约定：
权利不能放弃的强制许可体系。  在那些许可人不能放弃通过任何法定的或强制的许可方案收取许可使用费的权利的司法管辖区，许可人保留因您行使本许可协议授予的权利而向您收取许可使用费的专有权；
权利可以放弃的强制许可体系。  在那些许可人可以放弃通过任何法定的或强制的许可方案收取许可使用费的权利的司法管辖区，许可人放弃因您行使本许可协议授予的权利而向您收取许可使用费的专有权；

以上权利可在任何现有的或者以后出现的并为可适用的法律认可的媒体和形式上行使。上述权利包括为在其他媒体和形式上行使权利而必须进行技术性修改的权利，但除此之外，您不得对本作品进行任何修改。许可人在此保留所有未明示授予的权利。
第四条 限制
第三条的授权须受以下规定的限制：
您在发行或公开传播本作品时，必须遵守本许可协议。在您发行或公开传播的本作品的每一份复制件中，您必须附上一份本许可协议的复制件或本许可协议的网址（Uniform Resource Identifier）。您不得就本作品提出或增加任何条款，从而限制本许可协议或者限制获得本作品的第三方行使本许可协议所赋予的权利。您不得对本作品进行再许可。您必须在您发行或公开传播的每份作品复制件中完整保留所有与本许可协议及免责条款相关的声明。在发行或公开传播本作品时，您不得对本作品施加任何技术措施，从而限制从您处获得本作品的第三方行使本许可协议授予的权利。本项（第四条第1项）规定同样适用于收录在汇编作品中的本作品，但并不要求汇编作品中除本作品外的其他作品受本许可协议的约束。在创作汇编作品时，若接到任一许可人的通知，您必须按照其要求，在可行范围内删除汇编作品中根据本协议第四条第2项的要求所作的有关原始作者的身份及其他有关原始作品相关信息的标注。 
在发行或公开传播本作品或任何汇编作品时，除非有依据第四条第1项之要求，否则您必须完整保留所有关于本作品的著作权声明，并以适于所使用的媒介或方法的形式提供下述信息：（1）在原始作者的姓名（或笔名）已被提供的情况下，给出该姓名或笔名，或者在原始作者或许可人以许可人的著作权声明或其他合理的方式，指定可以在作品上署名的他方当事人姓名的情况下，指明该他方当事人的名称（“署名人”）；（2）在本作品标题已被提供的情况下，给出本作品的标题；（3）在合理可行的范围内，标明许可人指定需与本作品同时出现的网址，除非该网址没有涉及到本作品的著作权声明或者关于本作品的许可信息。本项（第四条第2项）要求的对作者姓名和作品名称的指明可采取任何合理方式，但在汇编作品中，如果已经指明了汇编作品中所有内含作品的作者，那么对本作品名称和作者姓名的指明须同时出现在任何其他作者姓名出现的地方，并至少与对其他作者的指明一样显著。为避免疑义，本条有关标示作者姓名和作品名称之规定，仅适用于前述署名的用途；除非您事先另行取得原始作者、许可人或署名人的书面同意，否则您不得以明示或者默示的方式主张或暗示，您本人或您对作品的使用与原始作者、许可人或署名人有关联或者已获得上述人士的赞助或者支持。
除非其他法律法规另有规定，您在复制、发行或者公开表演本作品，或者复制、发行或者公开表演作为任何汇编作品一部分的本作品时，不得歪曲、损害或者以其他方式损害本作品，导致原始作者的名誉或者荣誉受损。
第五条 声明、保证和免责
除非本许可的当事人相互以书面的方式做出相反约定，且在相关法律所允许的最大范围内，否则许可人按其现状提供本作品，对本作品不作任何明示或者默示、依照法律或者其他规定的陈述或担保，包括但是不限于任何有关可否商业性使用、是否符合特定的目的、不具有潜在的或者其他缺陷、准确性或者不存在不论能否被发现的错误的担保。有些司法管辖区不允许排除前述默示保证，因此这些排除性规定并不一定适用于您。
第六条 责任限制
除非属于相关法律所要求的范围，许可人在任何情况下都不对您因本许可或因使用本作品而产生的任何直接损失、间接损失或惩罚性赔偿负责，即使许可人已被告知发生此类损害的可能性。
第七条 许可终止
在您违反本许可协议任何条款时，本许可及其所授予的权利将自动终止。然而，根据本许可从您处获取汇编作品的自然人、法人或者其他组织，如果他们仍完全遵守相关条款，则对他们的许可不会随之终止。即使本许可被终止，第一条、第二条、第五条、第六条、第七条以及第八条仍然有效。
在上述条款及条件的前提下，此处授予的许可在法定著作权保护期限内有效。即便如此，许可人保留依其他许可条款发行本作品及在任何时候停止发行本作品的权利；但是，许可人的上述权利不能被用于撤销本许可或任何其他在本许可条款下授予的或必须授予的许可，除本条第1项指明的终止外，本许可将保持其完全效力。
第八条 其他事项
当您发行、公开传播本作品或其汇编作品时，许可人给获得作品的第三方提供本作品的许可，其条款和条件与您所获得的许可相同。
如因相关法律，本许可的某一条款无效或不能履行，本许可其余条款的有效性和可履行性不受影响。如本许可的当事人未采取进一步措施，此类无效条款应在必要范围内进行最低限度的修改以使其有效和可履行。
除非当事人书面同意并签字放弃某条款和允许某违约行为，本许可的任何条款或规定都不应被视为已被放弃，或被视为允许此违约行为。
本许可构成相关当事人与本授权作品相关的全部协议。除已在此处确认的之外，并不存在任何与本作品相关的谅解备忘录、协议或声明。许可人不受您提出的任何附加规定的约束。未经许可人和您双方书面同意，本许可不得更改。
“知识共享”（Creative Commons）声明
“知识共享”不是本许可协议的一方，对本作品不作任何相关保证。“知识共享”不对您或任何其他方的任何损失负责，包括但不限于与本许可相关的直接损失和间接损失。虽然有上述两点，但如果“知识共享”已明确标识自己为许可人，它将承担许可人的全部权利和义务。
除用于向公众表明本作品是依照知识共享公共许可协议（CCPL）授权以外，如未经“知识共享”事先书面同意，任何一方均不得使用“知识共享”（Creative Commons）商标和其他相关商标及标识。任何被允许的使用都必须符合“知识共享”的现行商标使用准则。该准则已在其网站上发布或可应要求随时提供。为避免疑义，本段关于商标的限制性规定不构成本许可之一部分。

Der Begriff "Abwandlung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes.
Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.
"Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt.
"Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist.
Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" im Sinne dieser Lizenz.
Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben.
Unter "Öffentlich Zeigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.
"Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form.
2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts
Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben.
3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten
Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.c) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ("unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann"):
Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;
den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten.
Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.
Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Weitergehende Änderungen oder Abwandlungen sind jedoch untersagt. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte.
4. Bedingungen
Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.b) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen.
Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben:
Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ("Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
den Titel des Inhaltes;
in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand.
Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.b) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten.
Die oben unter 4.a) und b) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen.
Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt.
5. Gewährleistung
SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT, SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT.
6. Haftungsbeschränkung
DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR, SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG.
7. Erlöschen
Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die den Schutzgegenstand enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort.
Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.
8. Sonstige Bestimmungen
Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat.
Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß Ziffern 8.a) angeboteten Lizenzen aus.
Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung.

Licencia
SE CONFIERE LA OBRA (TAL COMO SE DEFINE A CONTINUACIÓN) SEGÚN LAS CONDICIONES DE ESTA LICENCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS (“CCPL” O “LICENCIA”). LA OBRA ESTÁ PROTEGIDA POR LA LEGISLACIÓN VIGENTE EN MATERIA DE DERECHOS DE AUTOR Y DERECHOS CONEXOS EN EL ECUADOR, Y/U OTRAS LEYES APLICABLES. SE PROHÍBE TODO USO DE LA OBRA EXCEPTO EL AUTORIZADO SEGÚN ESTA LICENCIA O LAS LEYES ANTES MENCIONADAS.
AL EJERCER CUALQUIER DERECHO OTORGADO EN ESTA LICENCIA, EL LICENCIATARIO ACEPTA Y ACUERDA CUMPLIR LAS CONDICIONES DE LA MISMA. SI EN UNA INTERPRETACIÓN MÁS AMPLIA, ESTA LICENCIA PUDIERE CONSIDERARSE UN CONTRATO, EL LICENCIANTE LE OTORGA LOS DERECHOS EN ELLA CONTENIDOS TOMANDO EN CUENTA SU ACEPTACIÓN DE DICHOS TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES.
1. Definiciones
“Obra Derivada” Obras que revistan características de originalidad tales como: traducciones, resúmenes y extractos; arreglos musicales y las demás transformaciones de una obra literaria o artística; grabaciones o ejecuciones e incluye adaptaciones cinematográficas o cualquier otra forma en que la Obra pueda ser retransmitida, transformada o adaptada incluyendo cualquier forma reconociblemente derivada del original, excepto las obras que forman parte de una Colección, las mismas que no serán consideradas Obras Derivadas para los propósitos de esta Licencia. Para evitar cualquier duda, en los casos en los cuales la Obra sea una obra musical, ejecución o grabación musical, la sincronización de la obra de una forma cronometrada con una imagen en movimiento (“sincronización”) será considerada una Obra Derivada para los propósitos de esta Licencia.
“Colección” Es el conjunto de cosas por lo común de una misma clase o género, el conjunto de obras literarias o artísticas, tales como enciclopedias y antologías, o ejecuciones, grabaciones o transmisiones, u otras obras excepto las enumeradas en la Sección 1(f) siguiente, que, debido a la selección y al arreglo de sus contenidos, sean consideradas creaciones intelectuales, en las cuales la Obra se incluye en su extensión completa en formato no modificado, junto con una o más contribuciones adicionales de otros tipos, y cada una de las cuales sea considerada una Obra por separado e independiente por sí sola, y que en su conjunto se consideren como una Colección. Un trabajo que constituye una Colección no será considerada una Obra Derivada (tal como se define anteriormente) para los propósitos de esta Licencia.
“Distribución” Poner a disposición del público, el original o copias de la Obra, mediante su venta, arrendamiento, préstamo público o de cualquier otra forma conocida o por conocerse de transferencia de la propiedad, posesión o tenencia de dicho original o copia.
“Licenciante” Significa el individuo, los individuos, la entidad o las entidades, titular o titulares de los Derechos de Autor, que ofrecen la Obra según las estipulaciones de esta Licencia.

“Obra” Es toda creación intelectual original, de naturaleza artística, científica, o literaria, susceptible de ser divulgada o reproducida en cualquier forma conocida o por conocerse. Para los efectos de esta Licencia “Obra” también debe entenderse como una interpretación o ejecución, una emisión, un fonograma en el sentido de los Derechos Conexos de acuerdo con la Ley de Derechos de Autor, en la medida en que la interpretación o ejecución, la emisión o el fonograma estén protegidos por la ley aplicable.
“Licenciatario” Persona natural o jurídica que ejerce sus derechos según esta Licencia y que no ha infringido previamente las condiciones de la misma con respecto a la Obra. O quien ha recibido un permiso expreso por parte del licenciante para ejercer sus derechos según esta Licencia, a pesar de dicho incumplimiento previo.
“Ejecución Pública” Son las exhibiciones públicas de la Obra o comunicación al público de aquellos relatos públicos, por cualquier medio o proceso, incluyendo la ejecución digital pública o por medios conectados o inalámbricos; es poner a disposición del público las Obras de tal forma que los miembros del público puedan acceder a estas Obras desde un sitio y en un sitio que personalmente hayan seleccionado; es ejecutar la Obra ante el público por cualquier medio o proceso y la comunicación al público de dichas ejecuciones de la Obra, incluyendo la ejecución digital pública; difundir y volver a difundir la Obra por cualquier medio, sea señales, sonidos, imágenes u otro medio de difusión.

2. Usos Honrados.- Ninguna estipulación contenida en ésta Licencia podrá ser interpretada como una disminución, limitación o restricción de los derechos derivados del uso honrado y otras limitaciones o excepciones a los Derechos de Autor bajo el régimen legal vigente o derivado de cualquier otra norma aplicable.
3. Concesión de la Licencia.- Sujeto a los términos y a las condiciones de ésta Licencia, el Licenciante otorga al Licenciatario una Licencia mundial, sin cobro de regalías, no exclusiva e indefinida (depende del acuerdo de los contratantes de la licencia), para ejercer los derechos de Licenciatario de la Obra, tal como se estipulan a continuación:
Reproducir la Obra, e incorporarla en una o más Colecciones, y a reproducir la Obra tal como se incorpora en las Colecciones; y,
A distribuir y ejecutar públicamente la Obra incluyendo aquella cuando se incorpora en Colecciones.
Para evitar todas las dudas, el Licenciante renuncia al derecho de recaudar regalías, sea individualmente o en el caso en que el Licenciante sea miembro de una sociedad de recaudaciones que maneje esquemas de licencias voluntarias, mediante dicha sociedad, cuando el Licenciatario ejerza cualquier derecho otorgado según esta Licencia.
Se podrán ejercer dichos derechos en todos los formatos y medios, sean conocidos ahora o se conozcan en el futuro. Los derechos anteriores incluyen el derecho a realizar dichas modificaciones que sean técnicamente necesarias para ejercer los derechos en otros medios y formatos, pero a parte de eso, el Licenciatario no tiene derecho a hacer Obras Derivadas. Todos los derechos no cedidos expresamente por el Licenciante quedan reservados.
4. Restricciones.- La Licencia otorgada en la Sección 3 se sujeta expresamente y se limita según las siguientes restricciones:
El Licenciatario podrá distribuir o ejecutar públicamente la Obra solamente según las condiciones de esta Licencia. Deberá incluir una copia del Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI, por su sigla en inglés) para esta Licencia con cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente. El Licenciatario no podrá ofrecer ni imponer ninguna condición en la Obra que pueda restringir los términos de esta Licencia ni la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra para ejercer los derechos otorgados según las condiciones de esta Licencia. No podrá otorgar sub-licencias de la Obra. Deberá mantener sin modificaciones todas las notificaciones que se refieren a esta Licencia y a los descargos de responsabilidades con cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente. Cuando el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra, el Licenciatario no podrá imponer ninguna medida tecnológica vigente en la Obra que pueda restringir la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra por parte del Licenciatario para ejercer los derechos otorgados al receptor, según las condiciones de esta Licencia. Se aplica esta Sección 4(a) a la Obra tal como se incorpora en una Colección, pero para esto no hace falta que la Colección, aparte de la Obra en sí, esté sujeta a las condiciones de esta Licencia. Si el Licenciatario es Autor de una Colección, cuando reciba la notificación de cualquier Licenciante, el Licenciatario debe; en la medida en que sea práctico, retirar de la Colección cualquier crédito tal como se requiere de acuerdo con la Sección 4(b), según se solicite.
Si el Licenciatario distribuye o ejecuta públicamente la Obra o Colección, el Licenciatario debe, excepto si se ha presentado una solicitud según la Sección 4(a), mantener intactas todas las notificaciones de Derechos de Autor de la Obra e incluir, de forma razonable, dependiendo del medio o forma que el Licenciatario está usando: (i) el nombre del Autor (o seudónimo, si fuera aplicable) si fuera suministrado el nombre de dicha parte o partes, y/o si el Autor y/o el Licenciante designaran cualquier otra parte o partes (por ejemplo, un instituto auspiciante, una entidad de publicación, una revista) para el reconocimiento (las “Partes del Reconocimiento”) en la notificación de Derechos de Autor o condiciones del servicio del Licenciante o por otros medios razonables; (ii) el título de la Obra si fuera suministrado; (iii) en la medida en que fuera práctico, el Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI), si lo hubiere, que el Licenciante especifique que está asociado con la Obra; excepto si dicho URI no se refiere a la notificación del Derecho de Autor ni a la información de Licencias para la Obra. Se podrá implementar el crédito requerido por esta Sección 4(b) en cualquier forma razonable; siempre y cuando, en el caso de una Colección, por lo menos, aparecerá dicho crédito, si aparece un crédito de todos los autores que contribuyeron a la Colección, como una parte de estos créditos y de una forma, por lo menos, tan destacada como los créditos de los demás autores que contribuyeron. Para evitar toda duda, el Licenciatario solamente podrá usar el crédito requerido por esta Sección con el propósito de reconocimiento en la manera anteriormente descrita y, al ejercer sus derechos según esta Licencia, el Licenciatario no podrá implícita ni tácitamente aseverar ni dar a entender ninguna conexión, auspicio ni respaldo por parte del Autor, Licenciante ni Partes del Reconocimiento, según corresponda, otorgado al Licenciatario o a su uso de la Obra, sin el permiso independiente, expreso, previo y escrito del Autor, el Licenciante y/o las Partes del Reconocimiento.
Los derechos concedidos en la sección 3 se deben ejercer teniendo en cuenta los Derechos Morales del Autor para objetar cualquier alteración, mutilación o deformación u otra acción despectiva en relación al trabajo, que pudiera resultar perjudicial para el honor o reputación del Autor o de su dignidad como tal en la medida que el Autor no puede renunciar a los Derechos Morales bajo las disposiciones legales aplicables.
5. Declaraciones, Exoneración de Garantía y Responsabilidad
SALVO PACTO EN CONTRARIO DE AMBAS PARTES, QUE CONSTE POR ESCRITO, Y EN LA MAYOR EXTENSIÓN DE LO PERMITIDO POR LAS LEYES VIGENTES, EL LICENCIANTE OFRECE LA OBRA EN SUS CONDICIONES ACTUALES. EL AUTOR GARANTIZA LA AUTORÍA Y ORIGINALIDAD DE LA OBRA, SIN EMBARGO NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA SOBRE LA CALIDAD COMERCIAL DE LA OBRA O SU ADECUACIÓN PARA UN PROPÓSITO EN PARTICULAR.
6. Limitación de Responsabilidad.
SALVO QUE LA LEY APLICABLE LO EXIJA EXPRESAMENTE, EL LICENCIANTE EN NINGÚN CASO PODRÁ SER RESPONSABLE ANTE EL LICENCIATARIO POR NINGÚN DAÑO ESPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RESULTANTE, PUNITIVO NI EJEMPLAR QUE SURGIERA POR ESTA LICENCIA NI POR EL USO DE LA OBRA.
7. Terminación
Esta Licencia y los derechos otorgados por esta Licencia terminarán automáticamente si el Licenciatario incumpliera cualquiera de las condiciones de esta Licencia. Sin embargo, si hay individuos o entidades que hayan recibido Colecciones de parte del Licenciatario bajo esta Licencia, sus Licencias no terminarán, siempre y cuando dichos individuos o entidades cumplan por completo las condiciones de esas Licencias. Las Secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 se mantendrán ante cualquier terminación de esta Licencia.
Sujeto a las condiciones y términos antes mencionados, la Licencia otorgada aquí se concede por el tiempo que dura la protección de los Derechos de Autor de la Obra. No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho de emitir o publicar esta Obra bajo los términos de Licencias diferentes o a dejar de distribuir la Obra en cualquier momento; siempre y cuando dicha opción no cumpla el propósito de revocar esta Licencia (o cualquier otra Licencia adicional que haya sido, o que deba, ser otorgada según las condiciones de esta Licencia) y la misma continuará en plena vigencia y efecto, excepto si terminare según las estipulaciones previas.
8. Asuntos diversos
Cada vez que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra o una Colección, el Licenciante ofrecerá al receptor una Licencia para la Obra en las mismas condiciones y términos que la Licencia otorgada al Licenciatario según esta Licencia.
Si cualquier estipulación de esta Licencia no fuera válida ni exigible según las leyes aplicables, este hecho no afectará la validez o exigibilidad del resto de condiciones de esta Licencia, y sin que se requiera ninguna acción adicional de las partes de este acuerdo, se cambiará dicha estipulación en lo estrictamente necesario para que dicha estipulación sea válida y exigible.
No se considerará que se ha renunciado a ninguna estipulación ni condición de esta Licencia ni se considerará que se ha aceptado ningún incumplimiento excepto si dicha renuncia o consentimiento fueran por escrito y en éste constare la firma de las partes.
Esta Licencia constituye el acuerdo completo entre las partes con respecto a la Obra, cuya Licencia se otorga mediante este documento. No hay acuerdos, puntos de compromiso ni declaraciones con respecto a la Obra que no estén estipulados en el presente. El Licenciante no tendrá la obligación de cumplir ninguna estipulación adicional que podrá incluirse en cualquier comunicación enviada por el Licenciatario. No se podrá modificar esta Licencia sin el consentimiento escrito del Licenciante y del Licenciatario.
Notificación de Creative Commons
Creative Commons no es parte interesada de esta Licencia y no presenta ninguna garantía de ningún tipo en relación con la Obra. Creative Commons no es responsable ante el Licenciatario ni ante terceros por ninguna teoría legal de ningún daño de ningún tipo, incluyendo, entre otros, cualquier daño general, especial, incidental ni resultante que surgiera en relación con esta Licencia. Sin perjuicio de lo mencionado en las líneas precedentes, si Creative Commons se ha identificado expresamente como el Licenciante según este documento, Creative Commons tendrá todos los derechos y obligaciones del Licenciante.
Excepto para cumplir el propósito limitado de indicar al público que la Obra cuenta con la Licencia según el CCPL, Creative Commons no autoriza el uso por ninguna de las partes de la marca registrada “Creative Commons” ni de ninguna marca registrada ni logotipo relacionados con Creative Commons, sin el consentimiento previo y por escrito de Creative Commons.

1. Definicions 
L'obra és la creació literària, artística o científica oferta en els termes d'aquesta llicència. 
En aquesta llicència es considera una prestació qualsevol interpretació, execució, fonograma, enregistrament audiovisual, emissió o transmissió, mera fotografia o qualsevol altre objecte protegit per la legislació de propietat intel·lectual vigent aplicable. 
L'aplicació d'aquesta llicència a una col·lecció (definida més endavant) afectarà únicament l'estructura com a forma d'expressió de la selecció o disposició dels continguts, i no es farà extensiva a aquests. En aquest cas la col·lecció tindrà la consideració d'obra a efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
El titular originari és: 
En el cas d'una obra literària, artística o científica, la persona natural o el grup de persones que l'ha creada. 
En el cas d'una obra col·lectiva, la persona que l'editi i el divulgui amb el seu nom, llevat que hi hagi un pacte contrari. 
En el cas d'una interpretació o execució, l'actor, cantant, músic, o qualsevol altra persona que representi, canti, llegeixi, reciti, interpreti o executi de qualsevulla manera una obra. 
En el cas d'un fonograma, el productor fonogràfic, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica sota la iniciativa i responsabilitat de la qual es fa per primera vegada una fixació exclusivament sonora de l'execució d'una obra o d'altres sons. 
En el cas d'un enregistrament audiovisual, el productor de l'enregistrament, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica que tingui la iniciativa i assumeixi la responsabilitat de les fixacions d'un pla o una seqüència d'imatges, amb o sense so. 
En el cas d'una emissió o una transmissió, l'entitat de radiodifusió. 
En el cas d'una mera fotografia, aquella persona que l'hagi realitzada. 
En el cas d'altres objectes protegits per la legislació de la propietat intel·lectual vigent, la persona que aquesta indiqui. 
Es consideraran obres derivades aquelles obres creades a partir de l'objecte d'aquesta llicència com, per exemple, les traduccions i adaptacions; les revisions, actualitzacions i anotacions; els compendis, resums i extractes; els arranjaments musicals, i en general qualsevol transformació d'una obra literària, artística o científica. Per aclarir dubtes, si l'obra consisteix en una composició musical o en un enregistrament de sons, la sincronització temporal de l'obra amb una imatge en moviment (synching) serà considerada com una obra derivada als efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
Tindran la consideració de col·leccions la recopilació d'obres alienes, de dades o d'altres elements independents com ara les antologies i les bases de dades que per la selecció o disposició de llurs continguts constitueixin creacions intel·lectuals. La mera incorporació d'una obra en una col·lecció no donarà lloc a una obra derivada a efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
El llicenciador és la persona o l'entitat que ofereix l'obra o la prestació subjecta als termes d'aquesta llicència i que en concedeix els drets d'explotació conforme al que s'hi disposa. 
Vós sou la persona o l'entitat que exerceix els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència i que prèviament no ha violat els termes d'aquesta llicència respecte a l'obra o la prestació, o que ha rebut un permís exprés del llicenciador per exercir els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència malgrat una violació anterior. 
La transformació d'una obra comprèn la traducció, l'adaptació i qualsevol altra modificació de la qual derivi una obra diferent. La creació resultant de la transformació d'una obra tindrà la consideració d'obra derivada. 
S'entén per reproducció la fixació directa o indirecta, provisional o permanent, per qualsevol mitjà i en qualsevol forma, de tota l'obra o la prestació o de part d'ella, que en permeti la comunicació o l'obtenció de còpies. 
S'entén per distribució el fet de posar a disposició del públic l'original o les còpies de l'obra o la prestació mitjançant la venda, el lloguer, el préstec o qualsevol altre sistema. 
S'entén per comunicació pública qualsevol acte mitjançant el qual una pluralitat de persones, que no pertanyin a l'àmbit domèstic de qui la duu a terme, pot tenir accés a l'obra o la prestació sense que se'ls hagi fet una distribució prèvia d'exemplars. Es considera comunicació pública el fet de posar l'obra o la prestació a disposició del públic per procediments electrònics amb fil o sense fil de manera que qualsevol persona pugui accedir-hi des d'on vulgui i quan vulgui. 
L'explotació de l'obra o la prestació comprèn la reproducció, la distribució, la comunicació pública i, en el seu cas, la transformació. 
2. Límits dels drets. No hi ha res en aquesta llicència que pretengui reduir o restringir qualsevol dels límits legals dels drets exclusius del titular dels drets de propietat intel·lectual d'acord amb la Llei de propietat intel·lectual o qualsevol altra normativa aplicable, ja siguin drets derivats d'usos legítims —com ara la còpia privada o la citació— ja siguin altres limitacions —com la que resulta de la primera venda d'exemplars (exhauriment). 
3. Concessió de llicència. Conforme a les condicions d'aquesta llicència, el llicenciador concedeix, pel termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual i a títol gratuït, una llicència d'àmbit mundial no exclusiva que inclou els drets següents: 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació. 
Dret d'incorporar l'obra o la prestació en una o més col·leccions. 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació lícitament incorporada en una col·lecció. 
Dret d'extraure i reutilitzar l'obra o la prestació d'una base de dades. 
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, el titular originari: 
Conserva el dret de percebre les remuneracions o compensacions previstes por actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació, qualificades per la llei com a irrenunciables i inalienables i subjectes a gestió col·lectiva obligatòria. 
Renuncia al dret exclusiu de percebre, tant individualment com mitjançant una entitat de gestió col·lectiva de drets, qualsevol remuneració derivada d'actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació que feu. 
Aquests drets es poden exercir en tots els mitjans i formats, tangibles o intangibles, coneguts en el moment de concessió d'aquesta llicència. Els drets esmentats inclouen el dret a efectuar les modificacions que siguin tècnicament necessàries per exercir els drets en altres mitjans i formats. Tots aquells drets no concedits expressament pel llicenciador queden reservats, incloent-hi, a títol enunciatiu però no limitatiu, els drets morals irrenunciables reconeguts per la llei aplicable. En la mesura que el llicenciador tingui drets exclusius previstos per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea en matèria de dret sui generis sobre bases de dades, renuncia expressament a aquests drets exclusius. 
4. Restriccions. La concessió de drets que implica aquesta llicència està subjecta i limitada a les restriccions següents: 
Podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació només en els termes d'aquesta llicència i n'heu d'incloure una còpia, o l'identificador uniforme de recursos (URI) corresponent. No podeu oferir o imposar cap condició sobre l'obra o la prestació que alteri o restringeixi els termes d'aquesta llicència o l'exercici dels drets per part dels seus concessionaris. No podeu subllicenciar l'obra o la prestació. Heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos referents a aquesta llicència i a l'absència de garanties. No podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació amb mesures tecnològiques que en controlin l'accés o l'ús d'una manera contrària als termes d'aquesta llicència. Aquesta secció 4.a també afecta l'obra o la prestació incorporada en una col·lecció, però no implica que la col·lecció en conjunt automàticament quedi o hagi de quedar subjecta als mateixos termes. En el cas que us sigui requerit, mitjançant una comunicació prèvia del llicenciador, si incorporeu l'obra o la prestació en una col·lecció, haureu d'eliminar qualsevol dels crèdits requerits en l'apartat 4.b, fins on sigui possible. 
Si reproduïu, distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament l'obra o la prestació o una col·lecció que la incorpori, heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos sobre la propietat intel·lectual i indicar, de manera raonable conforme al mitjà o als mitjans que useu: 
El nom de l'autor original, o el pseudònim si és el cas, així com el del titular originari, si s'ha facilitat. 
El nom d'aquelles parts (per exemple: institució, publicació, revista) que el titular originari o el llicenciador designin perquè siguin reconegudes en l'avís legal, les condicions d'ús, o de qualsevol altra manera raonable. 
El títol de l'obra o la prestació si s'ha facilitat. 
L'URI, si n'hi ha, que el llicenciador especifiqui perquè sigui vinculat a l'obra o la prestació, llevat que aquest URI no es refereixi a l'avís legal o a la informació sobre la llicència de l'obra o la prestació. 
Aquest reconeixement s'ha de fer de manera raonable. En el cas d'una incorporació en una col·lecció, aquests crèdits hauran d'aparèixer com a mínim en el mateix lloc on hi hagi els corresponents a altres autors o titulars i de forma comparable a aquests. Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, els crèdits requerits en aquesta secció només s'usaran a efectes d'atribució de l'obra o la prestació en la manera especificada anteriorment. Sense un permís previ per escrit, no podeu afirmar ni fer entendre implícitament ni explícitament cap connexió, patrocini o aprovació per part del titular originari, el llicenciador o les parts reconegudes cap a vós o cap l'ús que feu de l'obra o la prestació. 
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, s'ha de fer notar que les restriccions anteriors (paràgrafs 4.a i 4.b) no s'aplicaran a les parts de l'obra o la prestació subjecta a aquesta llicència que únicament puguin ser protegides mitjançant el dret sui generis sobre bases de dades recollit per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea de bases de dades. 
5. Exoneració de responsabilitat 
LLEVAT QUE S'ACORDI MÚTUAMENT ENTRE LES PARTS, EL LLICENCIADOR OFEREIX L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ TAL COM ÉS (ON AN AS-IS BASIS) I NO CONFEREIX GARANTIA DE CAP MENA RESPECTE DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ O LA PRESÈNCIA O L'ABSÈNCIA D'ERRORS QUE ES PUGUIN DETECTAR O NO. ALGUNES JURISDICCIONS NO PERMETEN L'EXCLUSIÓ D'AQUESTES GARANTIES, DE MANERA QUE AQUESTA EXCLUSIÓ POT NO SER APLICABLE EN EL VOSTRE CAS. 
6. Limitació de responsabilitat. LLEVAT QUE LA LLEI APLICABLE HO DISPOSI EXPRESSAMENT I IMPERATIVAMENT, EN CAP CAS EL LLICENCIADOR SERÀ RESPONSABLE DAVANT VOSTRE PER QUALSEVOL DANY QUE EN PUGUI RESULTAR, TANT SI ÉS GENERAL COM ESPECIAL (INCLOSOS EL DANY EMERGENT I EL LUCRE CESSANT), FORTUÏT O CAUSAL, DIRECTE O INDIRECTE, PRODUÏT PER L'ÚS DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ DURANT EL PERÍODE EN QUÈ S'ESTÉN AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA, ENCARA QUE EL LLICENCIADOR HAGUÉS ESTAT INFORMAT DE LA POSSIBILITAT D'AQUESTS DANYS. 
7. Finalització de la llicència 
Aquesta llicència i la concessió dels drets que conté acabaran automàticament en cas que se n'incompleixi qualsevol dels termes. No obstant això, no s'anul·larà la llicència d'aquelles persones o entitats que hagin rebut col·leccions vostres amb aquesta llicència, sempre que aquestes persones o entitats es mantinguin en el compliment íntegre d'aquesta llicència. Les seccions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, i 8 continuaran vigents malgrat que finalitzi aquesta llicència. 
Conforme a les condicions anteriors, la concessió de drets d'aquesta llicència és vigent per tot el termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual segons la llei aplicable. Malgrat això, el llicenciador es reserva el dret a divulgar o publicar l'obra o la prestació en condicions diferents a les presents, o a retirar-la en qualsevol moment. Tanmateix, això no suposarà donar per conclosa aquesta llicència (o qualsevol altra llicència que hagi estat concedida, o calgui concedir, en els termes d'aquesta llicència), sinó que continuarà vigent i amb efectes complets, a menys que no hagi finalitzat conforme allò establert anteriorment, sense perjudici del dret moral de penediment en els termes reconeguts per la llei de propietat intel·lectual aplicable. 
8. Miscel·lània 
Cada vegada que exploteu d'alguna manera l'obra o la prestació, o una col·lecció que la incorpori, el llicenciador ofereix als tercers i successius llicenciataris la concessió de drets sobre l'obra o la prestació, en les mateixes condicions que la llicència que us ha estat concedida. 
Si alguna disposició d'aquesta llicència resulta invàlida o inaplicable segons la llei vigent, això no afectarà la validesa o l'aplicabilitat de la resta dels termes d'aquesta llicència i, sense cap acció addicional per a qualsevol de les parts d'aquest acord, aquesta disposició s'entendrà reformada en allò estrictament necessari per fer que aquesta disposició sigui vàlida i executiva. 
No s'entendrà que hi ha renúncia pel que fa a algun terme o disposició d'aquesta llicència, ni que se'n consent cap violació, llevat que la renúncia o el consentiment figuri per escrit i estigui firmat per la part que renuncia o que consent. 
Aquesta llicència constitueix l'acord ple entre les parts respecte de l'obra o la prestació objecte d'aquesta llicència. No hi ha interpretacions, acords o condicions respecte de l'obra o la prestació que no s'especifiquin expressament en aquesta llicència. El llicenciador no estarà obligat per cap disposició complementària que pugui aparèixer en qualsevol comunicació vostra. Aquesta llicència no es pot modificar sense que ho acordeu per escrit amb el llicenciador. 
Avís de Creative Commons 
Creative Commons no és part d'aquesta llicència, i no ofereix cap garantia en relació amb l'obra o la prestació. Creative Commons no serà responsable davant vostre —o davant cap part—, ni per cap dany de cap tipus, tant si és general o especial (incloent-hi el dany emergent i el lucre cessant), com si és fortuït o causal, que estigui relacionat amb aquesta llicència. A pesar de les dues (2) afirmacions anteriors, si Creative Commons s'identifica expressament com a llicenciador, tindrà tots els drets i les obligacions del llicenciador. 
Llevat del propòsit limitat d'indicar al públic que l'obra o la prestació està subjecta a una llicència CCPL, cap part usarà la marca registrada Creative Commons ni cap altra marca registrada o insígnia relacionada amb Creative Commons sense el seu consentiment per escrit. Qualsevol ús permès es farà conforme a les pautes vigents en cada moment sobre l'ús de la marca registrada per Creative Commons, publicades en el seu web o proporcionades amb petició prèvia. Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, les restriccions en l'ús de la marca no formen part d'aquesta llicència.

Licencia 
LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN (SEGÚN SE DEFINEN MÁS ADELANTE) SE PROPORCIONA BAJO LOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTA LICENCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS (CCPL LICENCIA).

QUEDA PROHIBIDO CUALQUIER USO DE LA OBRA O PRESTACIÓN DIFERENTE A LO AUTORIZADO BAJO ESTA LICENCIA O LO DISPUESTO EN LA LEY DE PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL. 
MEDIANTE EL EJERCICIO DE CUALQUIER DERECHO SOBRE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN, USTED ACEPTA Y CONSIENTE LAS LIMITACIONES Y OBLIGACIONES DE ESTA LICENCIA, SIN PERJUICIO DE LA NECESIDAD DE CONSENTIMIENTO EXPRESO EN CASO DE VIOLACIÓN PREVIA DE LOS TÉRMINOS DE LA MISMA. EL LICENCIADOR LE CONCEDE LOS DERECHOS CONTENIDOS EN ESTA LICENCIA, SIEMPRE QUE USTED ACEPTE LOS PRESENTES TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES. 
1. Definiciones 
La obra es la creación literaria, artística o científica ofrecida bajo los términos de esta licencia. 
En esta licencia se considera una prestación cualquier interpretación, ejecución, fonograma, grabación audiovisual, emisión o transmisión, mera fotografía u otros objetos protegidos por la legislación de propiedad intelectual vigente aplicable. 
La aplicación de esta licencia a una colección (definida más adelante) afectará únicamente a su estructura en cuanto forma de expresión de la selección o disposición de sus contenidos, no siendo extensiva a éstos. En este caso la colección tendrá la consideración de obra a efectos de esta licencia. 
El titular originario es: 
En el caso de una obra literaria, artística o científica, la persona natural o grupo de personas que creó la obra. 
En el caso de una obra colectiva, la persona que la edite y divulgue bajo su nombre, salvo pacto contrario. 
En el caso de una interpretación o ejecución, el actor, cantante, músico, o cualquier otra persona que represente, cante, lea, recite, interprete o ejecute en cualquier forma una obra. 
En el caso de un fonograma, el productor fonográfico, es decir, la persona natural o jurídica bajo cuya iniciativa y responsabilidad se realiza por primera vez una fijación exclusivamente sonora de la ejecución de una obra o de otros sonidos. 
En el caso de una grabación audiovisual, el productor de la grabación, es decir, la persona natural o jurídica que tenga la iniciativa y asuma la responsabilidad de las fijaciones de un plano o secuencia de imágenes, con o sin sonido. 
En el caso de una emisión o una transmisión, la entidad de radiodifusión. 
En el caso de una mera fotografía, aquella persona que la haya realizado. 
En el caso de otros objetos protegidos por la legislación de propiedad intelectual vigente, la persona que ésta señale. 
Se considerarán obras derivadas aquellas obras creadas a partir de la licenciada, como por ejemplo: las traducciones y adaptaciones; las revisiones, actualizaciones y anotaciones; los compendios, resúmenes y extractos; los arreglos musicales y, en general, cualesquiera transformaciones de una obra literaria, artística o científica. Para evitar la duda, si la obra consiste en una composición musical o grabación de sonidos, la sincronización temporal de la obra con una imagen en movimiento (synching) será considerada como una obra derivada a efectos de esta licencia. 
Tendrán la consideración de colecciones la recopilación de obras ajenas, de datos o de otros elementos independientes como las antologías y las bases de datos que por la selección o disposición de sus contenidos constituyan creaciones intelectuales. La mera incorporación de una obra en una colección no dará lugar a una derivada a efectos de esta licencia. 
El licenciador es la persona o la entidad que ofrece la obra o prestación bajo los términos de esta licencia y le concede los derechos de explotación de la misma conforme a lo dispuesto en ella. 
Usted es la persona o la entidad que ejercita los derechos concedidos mediante esta licencia y que no ha violado previamente los términos de la misma con respecto a la obra o la prestación, o que ha recibido el permiso expreso del licenciador de ejercitar los derechos concedidos mediante esta licencia a pesar de una violación anterior. 
La transformación de una obra comprende su traducción, adaptación y cualquier otra modificación en su forma de la que se derive una obra diferente. La creación resultante de la transformación de una obra tendrá la consideración de obra derivada. 
Se entiende por reproducción la fijación directa o indirecta, provisional o permanente, por cualquier medio y en cualquier forma, de toda la obra o la prestación o de parte de ella, que permita su comunicación o la obtención de copias. 
Se entiende por distribución la puesta a disposición del público del original o de las copias de la obra o la prestación, en un soporte tangible, mediante su venta, alquiler, préstamo o de cualquier otra forma. 
Se entiende por comunicación pública todo acto por el cual una pluralidad de personas, que no pertenezcan al ámbito doméstico de quien la lleva a cabo, pueda tener acceso a la obra o la prestación sin previa distribución de ejemplares a cada una de ellas. Se considera comunicación pública la puesta a disposición del público de obras o prestaciones por procedimientos alámbricos o inalámbricos, de tal forma que cualquier persona pueda acceder a ellas desde el lugar y en el momento que elija. 
La explotación de la obra o la prestación comprende la reproducción, la distribución, la comunicación pública y, en su caso, la transformación. 
2. Límites de los derechos. Nada en esta licencia pretende reducir o restringir cualesquiera límites legales de los derechos exclusivos del titular de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de acuerdo con la Ley de propiedad intelectual o cualesquiera otras leyes aplicables, ya sean derivados de usos legítimos, tales como la copia privada o la cita, u otras limitaciones como la resultante de la primera venta de ejemplares (agotamiento). 
3. Concesión de licencia. Conforme a los términos y a las condiciones de esta licencia, el licenciador concede, por el plazo de protección de los derechos de propiedad intelectual y a título gratuito, una licencia de ámbito mundial no exclusiva que incluye los derechos siguientes: 
Derecho de reproducción, distribución y comunicación pública de la obra o la prestación. 
Derecho a incorporar la obra o la prestación en una o más colecciones. 
Derecho de reproducción, distribución y comunicación pública de la obra o la prestación lícitamente incorporada en una colección. 
Derecho a extraer y reutilizar la obra o la prestación de una base de datos. 
Para evitar cualquier duda, el titular originario: 
Conserva el derecho a percibir las remuneraciones o compensaciones previstas por actos de explotación de la obra o prestación, calificadas por la ley como irrenunciables e inalienables y sujetas a gestión colectiva obligatoria. 
Renuncia al derecho exclusivo a percibir, tanto individualmente como mediante una entidad de gestión colectiva de derechos, cualquier remuneración derivada de actos de explotación de la obra o prestación que usted realice. 
Estos derechos se pueden ejercitar en todos los medios y formatos, tangibles o intangibles, conocidos en el momento de la concesión de esta licencia. Los derechos mencionados incluyen el derecho a efectuar las modificaciones que sean precisas técnicamente para el ejercicio de los derechos en otros medios y formatos. Todos los derechos no concedidos expresamente por el licenciador quedan reservados, incluyendo, a título enunciativo pero no limitativo, los derechos morales irrenunciables reconocidos por la ley aplicable. En la medida en que el licenciador ostente derechos exclusivos previstos por la ley nacional vigente que implementa la directiva europea en materia de derecho sui generis sobre bases de datos, renuncia expresamente a dichos derechos exclusivos. 
4. Restricciones. La concesión de derechos que supone esta licencia se encuentra sujeta y limitada a las restricciones siguientes: 
Usted puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra o prestación solamente bajo los términos de esta licencia y debe incluir una copia de la misma, o su Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI). Usted no puede ofrecer o imponer ninguna condición sobre la obra o prestación que altere o restrinja los términos de esta licencia o el ejercicio de sus derechos por parte de los concesionarios de la misma. Usted no puede sublicenciar la obra o prestación. Usted debe mantener intactos todos los avisos que se refieran a esta licencia y a la ausencia de garantías. Usted no puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra o prestación con medidas tecnológicas que controlen el acceso o el uso de una manera contraria a los términos de esta licencia. Esta sección 4.a también afecta a la obra o prestación incorporada en una colección, pero ello no implica que ésta en su conjunto quede automáticamente o deba quedar sujeta a los términos de la misma. En el caso que le sea requerido, previa comunicación del licenciador, si usted incorpora la obra en una colección, deberá quitar cualquier crédito requerido en el apartado 4.b, en la medida de lo posible. 
Si usted reproduce, distribuye o comunica públicamente la obra o la prestación, o una colección que la incorpore, debe mantener intactos todos los avisos sobre la propiedad intelectual e indicar, de manera razonable conforme al medio o a los medios que usted esté utilizando: 
El nombre del autor original, o el seudónimo si es el caso, así como el del titular originario, si le es facilitado. 
El nombre de aquellas partes (por ejemplo: institución, publicación, revista) que el titular originario y/o el licenciador designen para ser reconocidos en el aviso legal, las condiciones de uso, o de cualquier otra manera razonable. 
El título de la obra o la prestación si le es facilitado. 
El URI, si existe, que el licenciador especifique para ser vinculado a la obra o la prestación, a menos que tal URI no se refiera al aviso legal o a la información sobre la licencia de la obra o la prestación. 
Este reconocimiento debe hacerse de manera razonable. En el caso de incorporación en una colección estos créditos deberán aparecer como mínimo en el mismo lugar donde se hallen los correspondientes a otros autores o titulares y de forma comparable a los mismos. Para evitar la duda, los créditos requeridos en esta sección sólo serán utilizados a efectos de atribución de la obra o la prestación en la manera especificada anteriormente. Sin un permiso previo por escrito, usted no puede afirmar ni dar a entender implícitamente ni explícitamente ninguna conexión, patrocinio o aprobación por parte del titular originario, el licenciador y/o las partes reconocidas hacia usted o hacia el uso que hace de la obra o la prestación. 
Para evitar cualquier duda, debe hacerse notar que las restricciones anteriores (párrafos 4.a y 4.b) no son de aplicación a aquellas partes de la obra o la prestación objeto de esta licencia que únicamente puedan ser protegidas mediante el derecho sui generis sobre bases de datos recogido por la ley nacional vigente implementando la directiva europea de bases de datos 
5. Exoneración de responsabilidad 
A MENOS QUE SE ACUERDE MUTUAMENTE ENTRE LAS PARTES, EL LICENCIADOR OFRECE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN TAL CUAL (ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS) Y NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA DE CUALQUIER TIPO RESPECTO DE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN O DE LA PRESENCIA O AUSENCIA DE ERRORES QUE PUEDAN O NO SER DESCUBIERTOS. ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE TALES GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PUEDE NO SER DE APLICACIÓN A USTED. 
6. Limitación de responsabilidad. SALVO QUE LO DISPONGA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE LA LEY APLICABLE, EN NINGÚN CASO EL LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSABLE ANTE USTED POR CUALESQUIERA DAÑOS RESULTANTES, GENERALES O ESPECIALES (INCLUIDO EL DAÑO EMERGENTE Y EL LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUITOS O CAUSALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENCIA O EL USO DE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN, INCLUSO SI EL LICENCIADOR HUBIERA SIDO INFORMADO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE TALES DAÑOS. 
7. Finalización de la licencia 
Esta licencia y la concesión de los derechos que contiene terminarán automáticamente en caso de cualquier incumplimiento de los términos de la misma. Las personas o entidades que hayan recibido de usted colecciones bajo esta licencia, sin embargo, no verán sus licencias finalizadas, siempre que tales personas o entidades se mantengan en el cumplimiento íntegro de esta licencia. Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 permanecerán vigentes pese a cualquier finalización de esta licencia.

LANA EDO PRESTAZIOA (AURRERAGO DAUDE DEFINIZIOAK) CREATIVE COMMONS-EN BAIMEN PUBLIKO (CCPL EDO BAIMENA) HONEN BALDINTZAPEAN ESKAINTZEN DA. LANA EDO PRESTAZIOA ESPAINIAKO JABETZA INTELEKTUALAREN LEGEAREN ETA EZARGARRI DIREN GAINERAKO ARAUEN BABESEAN DAUDE. DEBEKATURIK DAGO LAN EDO PRESTAZIO HAU ERABILTZEA BAIMEN HONETAN ONETSITAKOAZ EDOTA JABETZA INTELEKTUALAREN LEGEETAN XEDATUTAKOAZ KANPOKO BESTE EZERTARAKO.
LANAREN EDO PRESTAZIORAREN GAINEKO EDOZEIN ESKUBIDE ERABILIZ GERO, BAIMEN HONEN MUGAK ETA BETEBEHARRAK ONARTZEN ETA BAIESTEN DITUZU, BAZTERREAN UTZI GABE BERARIAZKO BAIMENTZEA, BAIMENA ALDEZ AURRETIK URRATUZ GERO. BAIMENDUNAK BAIMEN HONEN MENDE DIREN ESKUBIDEAK LAGATZEN DIZKIZU, ZUK BALDINTZA ETA BETEBEHAR HAUEK ONARTZEN BADITUZU.
1. Definizioak
Lana da baimen honen baldintzapean eskaintzen den literatur, arte edo zientzia sorkaria.
Baimen honetan prestaziotzat jotzen da edozein interpretazio, joaldi, fonograma, ikus-entzunezko grabazio, emanaldi, transmisio, argazki edota jabetza intelektualaren legeak babestutako beste edozein objektu.
Baimen hau bilduma batean (aurrerago dago definizioa) ezartzean denean, edukien antolaera edo hautapena adierazteko eraren egiturari eragingo dio, baina ez die edukiei eragingo. Halakoetan, bilduma hartuko da lantzat baimen honen ondorioetarako.
Jatorrizko jabea da:
literatur, arte edo zientzia sorkarien kasuan, lana sortu zuen gizabanakoa edo pertsona multzoa.
lan kolektiboen kasuan, bere izenpean editatu eta hedatzen duen pertsona, besterik ituntzen ez bada.
interpretazio edo joaldi baten kasuan, antzezlaria, musikaria edo obra bat edozein eratan antzeztu, abestu, irakurri, interpretatu edo jotzen duen pertsona.
fonograma baten kasuan, ekoizle fonografikoa, hau da, lan baten edo era guztietako hotsen joaldi baten finkatze soilik soinuduna lehen aldiz egiteko ekimena eta erantzukizuna hartu duen pertsona natural edo juridikoa.
ikus-entzunezko grabazioen kasuan, grabazioaren ekoizlea, hau da, plano bat edo irudi sekuentzia bat, soinuaz edo soinurik gabe, finkatzeko ekimena eta erantzukizuna hartu duen pertsona natural edo juridikoa.
emanaldi edo transmisioen kasuan, irrati emailea.
argazki hutsen kasuan, egilea den pertsona.
jabetza intelektualaren legeak babestutako beste edozein objekturen kasuan, legeak xedatzen duen pertsona.
Lan eratorritzat joko dira lan baimendunetik abiatuta sortutakoak, besteak beste: itzulpenak eta egokitzapenak; berrikuspenak, eguneratzeak eta oharpenak; bildumak, laburpenak eta aterakinak; musika moldaketak eta, orobat, literatur, arte edo zientzia lan baten eraldaketa oro. Zalantzarik egon ez dadin, lana baldin bada musika konposizioa eta soinu grabaketa, lan hori mugimenduzko irudiekin denboraz sinkronizatzea lan eratorritzat joko da baimen honen ondorioetarako.
Bildumatzat hartuko dira besteren lanen bildumak, datuzkoak edo bestelako elementu lokabezkoak, hala nola antologiak edota datu baseak, edukien hautapenagatik edo antolaeragatik sorkari intelektualak baldin badira. Lan bat bilduma baten barruan sartze hutsak ez du lan eratorririk sortuko baimen honen.
Baimenduna da lana edo prestazioa baimen honen baldintzapean eskaintzen duen pertsona edo erakundea, eta ustiapen-eskubideak lagatzen dituena hemen xedatutakoaren arabera.
Zu zara baimen honen bitartez lagatako eskubideak erabiltzen dituen pertsona edo erakundea eta aurrez lanari edo prestazioari buruz baimenaren baldintzak urratu ez dituena, edota baimendunaren berariazko onespena jaso duena baimen honen bitartez lagatako eskubideak erabiltzeko, nahiz aurretik urraketa egina izan.
Lanaren eraldatzea da itzultzea, egokitzea edota forma beste edonola aldatzea, nondik sortzen baita beste lan berri bat. Lan baten eraldaketa bidez gauzatzen den sorkaria lan eratorritzat joko da.
Erreprodukziotzat hartuko da lana edo prestazioa hedatzeko edo kopiak egiteko aukera ematen duen euskarri batean zuzenean nahiz zeharka finkatzea, behin-behin-behinekoz edo betirako, edozein bitarteko edo formatan delarik ere.
Banaketatzat hartzen da jendearen eskura jartzea lanaren edo prestazioaren jatorrizkoa nahiz kopiak, euskarri ukigai batean, salmenta, alokatze, mailegu edo beste edozein bidez.
Jendaurreko hedapentzat hartuko dira lana edo prestazioa jendaurrean, hedapena egiten duen pertsonaren etxekoen aurrean ez bada erakusteko egintza guztiak, pertsona bakoitzari lanaren edo prestazioaren ale bana aurrez eman behar izanik gabe. Jendaurreko hedapentzat joko da lana edo prestazioa jendearen eskura ipintzea bitarteko haridun nahiz hari gabekoen bidez, eta horren barnean izango da lana jendearen esku jartzea, jendeak nahi duen lekutik eta nahi duenean eskuratzeko moduan.
Lana edo prestazioa ustiatzea da erreproduzitzea, banatzea, jendaurrean hedatzea eta eraldatzea.
2. Eskubideen mugak. Baimen honetan ez dira ezertan mugatu edo gutxitu nahi jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen jabeak, Jabetza Intelektualaren Legearen arabera edota aplikagarri den beste edozein legeren arabera, bereak baino ez dituen eskubideen legezko mugak, berdin dio muga horiek erabilera zilegien ondorio izan, adibidez kopia pribatuaren eskubidearena edo aipamen eskubidearena, edo bestelako mugakizunen ondorio izan, hala nola aleen lehen salmentarena (agortzea).
3. Baimen ematea. Baimen honetan adierazten diren betebehar eta baldintzen arabera, baimendunak mundu osoaren esparruko baimen ez esklusiboa ematen du, jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen indarraldi osorako eta trukean ordainsari gabe, eskubide hauen lagapena eginez:
Lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzeko eskubidea.
Lana edo prestazioa bilduma batean nahiz gehiagotan txertatzeko eskubidea.
Baimen batean legez txertatutako lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzeko eskubidea.
Lana edo prestazioa datu base batetik erauzi eta berrerabitzeki eskubidea
Zalantzarik egon ez dadin, jatorrizko jabeak:
lana edo prestazioa ustiatzeko ekintzen truke dagozkion ordainsariak edo kalte-ordainak jasotzeko eskubidea gordetzeko du, legeak lagaezintzat eta besterenezintzat jotzen dituen guztietan, eta nahitaezko kudeaketa kolektiboaren mende daudenetan.
uko egiten dio lanaz edo prestazioaz zuk egiten dituzun ustiapen ekintzen truke inolako ordainsaririk jasotzeko bakarreko eskubideari, nahiz bakarka, nahiz eskubideen kudeatze kolektiboko entitateen bitartez.
Adierazitako eskubide horiek bitarteko eta formatu guztien bidez erabil daitezke, ukigarriak nahiz ukiezinak izan, baimen hau ematerakoan ezagun direnen arabera. Aipatutako eskubide horien barruan dago behar diren aldaketa teknikoak egiteko eskubidea, beste bitarteko eta formatuetan erabili ahal izateko eskubideok. Baimendunak berariaz lagatzen ez dituen eskubide guztiak erreserbatu egiten dira, barne direla, azalpen gisara baina ez hartara mugatuta, legeetan aitortutako eskubide moral lagaezinak. Datu baseen gaineki sui generis eskubideei buruzko Europako arteztaraua gauzatzen duen lege nazionalaren arabera, bakarreko eskubideak badagozkio baimendunari, uko egiten eskubide horiei.
4. Murrizketak. Baimen honek ematen duen eskubide-lagapena murrizketa hauen mende dago mugatua:
Baimen honen baldintzen pean soilik erreproduzitu, banatu edo jendaurrean hedatu dezakezu lana edo prestazioa, eta baimenaren kopia edota URIa (Uniform Resource Identifier) erantsi behar diozu. Ezin duzu lanaren edo prestazioaren gainean baldintzarik eskani edo ezarri, baimen honetako baldintzak edot lagapen-hartzaileen eskubide erabilera ezertan aldatu edo murrizten baditu. Ezin duzu lana edo prestazioa birbaimendu. Oso-osorik gorde behar dituzu baimen honi buruzko eta berme ezari buruzko ohar guztiak. Ezin duzu lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu edo jendaurrean hedatu lanaren eskuratzea edo erabilera baimen honetako baldintzen aurka kontrolatzen duten bitarteko teknologikoez. Bilduma batean txertatutako lanari edo prestazioari ere eragiten dio 4.a atal honek, baina horrek ez du esan nahi bilduma osorik baimen honen mende gelditzen edo gelditu behar besterik gabe. Eskatzen bazaizu, baimendunak hala adierazita, lana edo prestazioa bilduma batean txertatzen baduzu, kendu beharko dituzu 4.b paragrafoan eskatzen diren kredituak, ahal duzun neurrian.
Lana edo prestazioa, nahiz hura jasotzen duen bilduma bat erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzen baduzu, ukitu gabe gorde behar dituzu jabetza intelektuari buruzko ohar guztiak, eta erabitzen ari zaren bitartekoen arabera, arrazoizko eran adierazi:
jatorrizko egilearen izena, edo goitizen behar bada, baita jatorrizko jabearena ere, horren berri ematen badizute;
jatorrizko jabeak edo baimendunak lege-oharrean, erabilera baldintzetan edota beste arrazoizko atalen batean jaso beharrekotzat izendatzen dituzten aldeen izenak (adibidez: erakundea, argitalpena, aldizkaria);
lanaren edo prestazioaren izenburua, horren berri ematen badizute;
baimendunak zehaztutakoaren arabera, lanari edo prestazioari estekatzeko URIa, non eta URI horrek ez duen zer ikusirik lege-oharrarekin edo lanaren edo prestazioaren baimen argibideekin;
Aitorpen hori zentzuzko eran egin behar da. Bilduma batean txertatua denean, aitorpena agertu behar da, gutxienik, beste egile edo jabeen aipamenak ageri diren leku berean eta era berdintsuan. Zalantzarik ez izateko, atal honetan eskatzen diren kredituak erabili behar dira, soil-solik, lanaren edo prestazioaren aitorpena egiteko, arestian zehaztutako eran. Aldez aurretik idatzko baimena izan ezik, zuk ezin duzu baieztatu edo era inplizitu nahiz esplizituan aditzera eman jatorrizko jabearekiko, baimendunarekiko edota aitortutako aldeekiko inolako lotura, babes edo onarpenik duzunik, ez zuk, ez lanaz edo prestazioaz egiten duzun erabilerak.
Zalantzarik ez izateko, nabarmendu behar da aurreko murrizketak (4.a eta 4.b) ez zaizkiela aplikatzen datu basen gaineko sui generis eskubideei buruzko Europako arteztaraua gauzatzen duen lege nazionalaren indarrez baskarrik babes daitezkeen lanaren edo prestazioaren zatiei.
5. Erantzukizunei uko egitea
BAIMENDUNAK LANA EDO PRESTAZIOA DAGOEN-DAGOEN ESKAINTZEN DU, ALDEEK BESTERIK ELKAR HARTZEN EZ DUTEN BITARTEAN, ETA EZ DU INOLAKO BERMERIK EMATEN LANARI EDO PRESTAZIOARI BURUZ EDOTA BERTAN EGON DAITEZKEEN AKATSEZ, ATZEMANAK IZAN EDO EZ. JURISDIKZIO BATZUETAN EZIN DIRA BERME HORIEK SALBUETSI, ETA AGIAN SALBUESPEN HORI EZ DA ZURETZAT APLIKAGARRI IZANGO.
6. Erantzukizuna mugatzea.
APLIKATZEKOA DEN LEGEAK BERARIAZ ETA AGINDUZ HALA XEDATZEN EZ BADU, BAIMENDUNA EZ DA ZUREKIKO ERANTZULE IZANGO SORTUTAKO KALTEENGATIK, DIRELA OROKORRAK, DIRELA BEREZIAK (BARNE DIRA SORTUTAKO KALTEAK ETA ESKURATU GABEKO IRABAZIAK), HALABEHARREZKOAK ZEIN USTEKABEKOAK, ZUZENEKOAK NAHIZ ZEHARKAKOAK, BAIMEN HONI EDO LANAREN EDO PRESTAZIOAREN ERABILERARI LOTURIK SORTUTAKOAK, ARE BAIMENDUNARI KALTE HORIEN AUKERAREN BERRI EMANA BALDIN BAZAIO ERE.
7. Baimen amaiera
Baimen hau eta beraren ondorioz lagatako eskubideak beste gabe amaituko dira baimenaren baldintza guztiak betetzen ez badira. Baimen honen mende zuregandik bildumak jaso dituzten pertsonen edo erakundeen baimenak, ordea, ez dira amaituko pertsona edo erakunde horiek baimen honen baldintza guztiak betetzen jarraitzen badute. Baimen honetako 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 eta 8. atalek indarrean jarraituko dute baimen honen indarraldia amaitu arren.
Aurreko baldintza eta betebeharren arabera, baimen honen eskubide-lagapena jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen indarraldi osorako da, legeen arabera. Aurrekoa hala izanik ere, baimendunak beretzat gordetzen du lana beste baldintza batzuetan hedatu edo argitaratzeko eskubidea, eta noiznahi aldaratzekoa. Nolanahi den ere, horrek ez du baimen hau amaitutzat harraraziko (ez eta baimen honen baldintzapean emandako edo eman beharreko beste baimenik ere), indarrean jarraituko baitu ondorio guztietarako, aurrez xedatutakoaren arabera amaitzen den arte, jabetza intelektualaren legeak aitortzen duen damuaren eskubide morala baztertu gabe.
8. Orotarikoa
Zuk lana edo prestazioa, edota hura erantsita duen bilduma bat, ustiatzen duzun bakoitzean, jatorrizko baimendunak hirugarren eta hurrengo baimen hartzaileei eskaintzen die lanaren edo prestazioaren gaineko eskubide-lagapena, zuri emandako baimenaren betebehar eta baldintza berberetan.
Baimen honetan jasotako xedapenen bat baliogabea edo aplikaezina baldin bada legearen arabera, horrek ez dio eragingo baimen honetako gainerako baldintzen balioari edo aplikagarritasunari, eta hitzarmen honen aldeek beste ezer egin behar izanik gabe, xedapen hori ezinbestekoa den neurrian birmoldatutzat joko da baliozkoa eta betebeharrekoa izan dadin.
Ez da onartuko baimen honen xedapen edo baldintzaren bati uko egiterik, edo hura urratzeko onespenik, uko egite hori edo urratze-onespen hori ez badago idatziz emana, eta uko egiten duen edo onesten duen aldeak izenpetua.
Baimen hau aldeen orobateko hitzarmena da, baimenaren gai den lanari edo prestazioari dagokionez. Ez dago lanaren edo prestazioaren gaineko interpretaziorik, adostasunik edo baldintzarik ezartzerik, ez badaude baimen honetan berariaz zehaztuta. Baimenduna ez da zuk berari bidalitako jakinarazpenetan ager daitezkeen xedapen osagarrien mende egongo. Baimen hau ezin da aldatu baimendunaren eta zure arteko adostasun idatziaz ez bada.
Creative Commons-en oharra
Creative Commons ez da baimen honen partaide eta ez du inolako bermerik eskaintzen lanari edo prestazioari buruz. Creative Commons ez da zurekiko nahiz besterekiko erantzule izango, edozein teoria legalen arabera, sortutako kalteengatik, barne direlarik, baina ez bakarrik, kalte orokor zein bereziak (barne dira sortutako kalteak eta eskuratu gabeko irabaziak), halabeharrezkoak zein ustekabekoak, baimen honi loturik sortutakoak. Aurreko bi (2) perpausetan adierazitakoa hala izanik ere, Creative Commons berariazko baimendun gisa identifikatua baldin bada, baimendunaren eskubide eta betebehar guztiak izango ditu.
Lana edo prestazioa Creative Commons-en baimen publikoaren mende baimenduta dagoela jendeari adierazteko xede mugatuaz gain, inork ez du erabiliko «Creative Commons» marka erregistraturik, edo «Creative Commons»-ekin lotutako beste marka erregistratu edo ezaugarririk, hark berariaz onespenik eman gabe. Baimendutako erabilera guztiak «Creative Commons» marka erregistratua erabiltzeko une bakoitzean indarrean diren jarraibideen arabera egingo dira, haren webgunean argitaratu edo aurrez eskaturik ematen diren neurrian. Zalantzarik ez izateko, marka erabiltzeko murrisketa horiek ez dira baimenaren zati.

O LICENCIADOR CÉDELLE OS DEREITOS CONTIDOS NESTA LICENZA, SEMPRE QUE VOSTEDE ACEPTE OS PRESENTES TERMOS E CONDICIÓNS.
1. Definicións
A obra é a creación literaria, artística ou científica ofrecida nos termos desta licenza.
Nesta licenza considérase unha prestación calquera interpretación, execución, fonograma, gravación audiovisual, emisión ou transmisión, simple fotografía ou outros obxectos protexidos pola lexislación de propiedade intelectual vixente aplicábel.
A aplicación desta licenza a unha colección (definida máis adiante) afectaralle unicamente á súa estrutura en canto forma de expresión da selección ou disposición dos seus contidos, mais non é extensiva a estes. Neste caso a colección terá a consideración de obra para os efectos desta licenza.
O titular orixinario é:
No caso dunha obra literaria, artística ou científica, a persoa natural ou grupo de persoas que creou a obra.
No caso dunha obra colectiva, a persoa que a edite e divulgue baixo o seu nome, salvo pacto contrario.
No caso dunha interpretación ou execución, o actor, cantante, músico, ou calquera outra persoa que represente, cante, lea, recite, interprete ou execute de calquera forma unha obra.
No caso dun fonograma, o produtor fonográfico, é dicir, a persoa natural ou xurídica baixo a iniciativa e responsabilidade da cal se realiza por primeira vez unha fixación exclusivamente sonora da execución dunha obra ou doutros sons.
No caso dunha gravación audiovisual, o produtor da gravación, é dicir, a persoa natural ou xurídica que teña a iniciativa e asuma a responsabilidade das fixacións dun plano ou secuencia de imaxes, con ou sen son.
No caso dunha emisión ou dunha transmisión, a entidade de radiodifusión.
No caso dunha simple fotografía, aquela persoa que a realizou.
No caso doutros obxectos protexidos pola lexislación de propiedade intelectual vixente, a persoa que esta indique.
Consideraranse obras derivadas aquelas obras creadas a partir da licenciada, como por exemplo: as traducións e adaptacións; as revisións, actualizacións e anotacións; os compendios, resumos e extractos; os arranxos musicais e, en xeral, calquera transformación dunha obra literaria, artística ou científica. Para evitar a dúbida, se a obra consiste nunha composición musical ou gravación de sons, a sincronización temporal da obra cunha imaxe en movemento (synching) será considerada como unha obra derivada para os efectos desta licenza.
Terán a consideración de coleccións a compilación de obras alleas, de datos ou doutros elementos independentes como as antoloxías e as bases de datos que pola selección ou disposición dos seus contidos constitúan creacións intelectuais. A simple incorporación dunha obra nunha colección non dará lugar a unha derivada para os efectos desta licenza.
O licenciador é a persoa ou a entidade que ofrece a obra ou prestación nos termos desta licenza e lle concede os seus dereitos de explotación conforme o disposto nela.
Vostede é a persoa ou a entidade que exerce os dereitos concedidos mediante esta licenza e que non violou previamente os seus termos con respecto á obra ou á prestación, ou que recibiu o permiso expreso do licenciador para exercer os dereitos concedidos mediante esta licenza a pesar dunha violación anterior.
A transformación dunha obra comprende a súa tradución, adaptación e calquera outra modificación na súa forma da que se derive unha obra diferente. A creación resultante da transformación dunha obra terá a consideración de obra derivada.
Enténdese por reprodución a fixación directa ou indirecta, provisional ou permanente, por calquera medio e en calquera forma, de toda a obra ou a prestación ou de parte dela, que permita a súa comunicación ou a obtención de copias.
Enténdese por distribución a posta a disposición do público do orixinal ou das copias da obra ou da prestación, nun soporte tanxible, mediante a súa venda, alugueiro, préstamo ou de calquera outra forma.
Enténdese por comunicación pública todo acto polo cal unha pluralidade de persoas, que non pertenzan ao ámbito doméstico de quen a leva a cabo, poida ter acceso á obra ou á prestación sen previa distribución de exemplares a cada unha delas. Considérase comunicación pública a posta a disposición do público de obras ou prestacións por procedementos con fíos ou sen fíos, de tal forma que calquera persoa poida acceder a elas dende o lugar e no momento que elixa.
A explotación da obra ou a prestación comprende a reprodución, a distribución, a comunicación pública e, no seu caso, a transformación.
2. Límites dos dereitos. Nada nesta licenza pretende reducir ou restrinxir calquera dos límites legais dos dereitos exclusivos do titular dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual de acordo coa Lei de Propiedade Intelectual ou calquera outra lei aplicábel, xa sexan derivados de usos lexítimos, tales como a copia privada ou a cita, ou outras limitacións como o resultante da primeira venda de exemplares (esgotamento).
3. Concesión de licenza. Conforme os termos e ás condicións desta licenza, o licenciador concede, polo prazo de protección dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual e a título gratuíto, unha licenza de ámbito mundial non exclusiva que inclúe os seguintes dereitos:
Dereito de reprodución, distribución e comunicación pública da obra ou da prestación.
Dereito a incorporar a obra ou a prestación nunha ou máis coleccións.
Dereito de reprodución, distribución e comunicación pública da obra ou da prestación licitamente incorporada nunha colección.
Dereito a extraer e reutilizar a obra ou a prestación dunha base de datos.
Para evitar calquera dúbida, o titular orixinario:
Conserva o dereito a percibir as remuneracións ou compensacións previstas por actos de explotación da obra ou prestación, cualificadas pola lei como irrenunciábeis e inalienábeis e suxeitas a xestión colectiva obrigatoria.
Renuncia ao dereito exclusivo a percibir, tanto individualmente como mediante unha entidade de xestión colectiva de dereitos, calquera remuneración derivada de actos de explotación da obra ou prestación que vostede realice.
Estes dereitos pódense exercer en todos os medios e formatos, tanxíbeis ou intanxíbeis, coñecidos no momento da concesión desta licenza. Os dereitos mencionados inclúen o dereito a efectuar as modificacións que sexan precisas tecnicamente para o exercicio dos dereitos noutros medios e formatos. Todos os dereitos non concedidos expresamente polo licenciador quedan reservados, incluíndo a título enunciativo pero non limitativo, os dereitos morais irrenunciábeis recoñecidos pola lei aplicábel. Na medida en que o licenciador teña dereitos exclusivos previstos pola lei nacional vixente que implementa a directiva europea en materia de dereito sui generis sobre bases de datos, renuncia expresamente aos devanditos dereitos exclusivos.
4. Restricións. A concesión de dereitos que supón esta licenza atópase suxeita e limitada ás restricións seguintes:
Vostede pode reproducir, distribuír ou comunicar publicamente a obra ou prestación soamente baixo os termos desta licenza e debe incluír unha copia dela, ou o seu Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI).

Vostede non pode sublicenciar a obra ou prestación. Vostede debe manter intactos todos os avisos que se refiran a esta licenza e á ausencia de garantías. Vostede non pode reproducir, distribuír ou comunicar publicamente a obra ou prestación con medidas tecnolóxicas que controlen o acceso ou o uso dun xeito contrario aos termos desta licenza. Esta sección 4.a tamén afecta á obra ou prestación incorporada nunha colección, pero iso non implica que esta no seu conxunto quede automaticamente ou deba quedar suxeita aos seus termos. No caso que lle sexa requirido, logo de comunicación do licenciador, se vostede incorpora a obra nunha colección, deberá quitar calquera crédito requirido no apartado 4.b, na medida do posíbel.
Se vostede reproduce, distribúe ou comunica publicamente a obra ou a prestación, ou unha colección que a incorpore, debe manter intactos todos os avisos sobre a propiedade intelectual e indicar, de xeito razoábel conforme ao medio ou aos medios que vostede estea a empregar:
O nome do autor orixinal, ou o pseudónimo se é o caso, así como o do titular orixinario, se lle é facilitado.
O nome daquelas partes (por exemplo: institución, publicación, revista) que o titular orixinario e/ou o licenciador designen para ser recoñecidos no aviso legal, as condicións de uso, ou de calquera outro xeito razoábel.
O título da obra ou da prestación se lle é facilitado.
O URI, se existe, que o licenciador especifique para ser vinculado á obra ou á prestación, a menos que tal URI non se refira ao aviso legal ou á información sobre a licenza da obra ou a prestación.
Este recoñecemento debe facerse de xeito razoábel. No caso de incorporación nunha colección estes créditos deberán aparecer como mínimo no mesmo lugar onde se achen os correspondentes a outros autores ou titulares e de forma comparábel a estes. Para evitar a dúbida, os créditos requiridos nesta sección só serán empregados para os efectos de atribución da obra ou a prestación no xeito especificado anteriormente. Sen un permiso previo por escrito, vostede non pode afirmar nin dar a entender implicitamente nin explicitamente ningunha conexión, patrocinio ou aprobación por parte do titular orixinario, o licenciador e/ou as partes recoñecidas cara a vostede ou cara ao uso que fai da obra ou a prestación.
Para evitar calquera dúbida, debe facerse notar que as restricións anteriores (parágrafos 4.a e 4.b) non son de aplicación a aquelas partes da obra ou a prestación obxecto desta licenza que unicamente poidan ser protexidas mediante o dereito sui generis sobre bases de datos recollido pola lei nacional vixente que transpoña a directiva europea de bases de datos.
5. Ausencia de responsabilidade
SALVO QUE SE CONVEÑA MUTUAMENTE DOUTRO XEITO POLAS PARTES, O LICENCIADOR OFRECE A OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN TAL CAL (ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS) E NON CONFIRE NINGUNHA GARANTÍA DE NINGÚN TIPO RESPECTO DA OBRA OU DA PRESTACIÓN OU DA PRESENZA OU AUSENCIA DE ERROS QUE POIDAN OU NON SER DESCUBERTOS. ALGUNHAS XURISDICIÓNS NON PERMITEN A EXCLUSIÓN DAS DITAS GARANTÍAS, POLO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PODE NON SERLLE DE APLICACIÓN A VOSTEDE.
6. Limitación de responsabilidade. SALVO QUE O DISPOÑA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE A LEI APLICÁBEL, EN NINGÚN CASO O LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSÁBEL ANTE VOSTEDE POR CALQUERA DANO RESULTANTE, XERAL OU ESPECIAL (INCLUÍDO O DANO EMERXENTE E O LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUÍTOS OU CAUSAIS, DIRECTOS OU INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENZA OU O USO DA OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN, MESMO SE O LICENCIADOR FOSE INFORMADO DA POSIBILIDADE DE TALES DANOS.
7. Finalización da licenza
Esta licenza e a concesión dos dereitos que contén rematarán automaticamente en caso de calquera incumprimento dos seus termos. As persoas ou entidades que recibiran de vostede coleccións baixo esta licenza, non obstante, non verán as súas licenzas finalizadas, sempre que tales persoas ou entidades se manteñan no cumprimento íntegro desta licenza. As seccións 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 permanecerán vixentes malia calquera finalización desta licenza.
Conforme ás condicións e termos anteriores, a concesión de dereitos desta licenza é vixente por todo o prazo de protección dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual segundo a lei aplicábel. Malia o anterior, o licenciador resérvase o dereito a divulgar ou publicar a obra ou a prestación en condicións distintas ás presentes, ou de retirar a obra ou a prestación en calquera momento. Non obstante, iso non suporá dar por concluída esta licenza (ou calquera outra licenza que fose concedida, ou sexa necesario ser concedida, baixo os termos desta licenza), que continuará vixente e con efectos completos a non ser que finalizara conforme ao establecido anteriormente, sen prexuízo do dereito moral de arrepentimento nos termos recoñecidos pola Lei de Propiedade Intelectual aplicábel.
8. Miscelánea
Cada vez que vostede realice calquera tipo de explotación da obra ou a prestación, ou dunha colección que a incorpore, o licenciador ofrece aos terceiros e sucesivos licenciatarios a concesión de dereitos sobre a obra ou a prestación nas mesmas condicións e termos que a licenza concedida a vostede.
Se algunha disposición desta licenza resulta inválida ou inaplicábel segundo a Lei vixente, iso non afectará a validez ou aplicabilidade do resto dos termos desta licenza e, sen ningunha acción adicional por calquera das partes deste acordo, tal disposición entenderase reformada no estritamente necesario para facer que tal disposición sexa válida e executiva.
Non se entenderá que existe renuncia respecto de ningún termo ou disposición desta licenza, nin que se consente ningunha violación desta, a menos que tal renuncia ou consentimento figure por escrito e leve a sinatura da parte que renuncie ou consinta.
Esta licenza constitúe o acordo pleno entre as partes con respecto á obra ou a prestación obxecto da licenza. Non caben interpretacións, acordos ou condicións con respecto á obra ou a prestación que non se atopen expresamente especificados na presente licenza. O licenciador non estará obrigado por ningunha disposición complementaria que poida aparecer en calquera comunicación que faga chegar vostede. Esta licenza non se pode modificar sen o mutuo acordo por escrito entre o licenciador e vostede.

L'ŒUVRE (TELLE QUE DEFINIE CI-DESSOUS) EST MISE A DISPOSITION SELON LES TERMES DE CETTE LICENCE PUBLIQUE CREATIVE COMMONS (CI-APRES DENOMMEE « LPCC » OU « LICENCE »). L'ŒUVRE EST PROTEGEE PAR LE DROIT DE LA PROPRIETE LITTERAIRE ET ARTISTIQUE OU TOUTE AUTRE LOI APPLICABLE. TOUTE UTILISATION DE L'ŒUVRE AUTRE QUE CELLE AUTORISEE PAR CETTE LICENCE EST RÉSERVÉE.
L’EXERCICE DE TOUT DROIT SUR L’ŒUVRE MISE A DISPOSITION EMPORTE ACCEPTATION DES TERMES DE LA LICENCE. EN RAISON DU CARACTERE CONTRACTUEL DE LA LICENCE, L’OFFRANT ACCORDE A L’ACCEPTANT LES DROITS CONTENUS DANS CETTE LICENCE EN CONTREPARTIE DE SON ACCEPTATION.
1. Définitions
Adaptation : œuvre créée soit à partir de l’Œuvre seule, soit à partir de l’Œuvre et d’autres œuvres préexistantes. Constituent notamment des Adaptations, les traductions, adaptations, œuvres composites, arrangements ou modifications d’une œuvre littéraire et artistique, d’un phonogramme, d’un vidéogramme ou d’une interprétation d’une œuvre, y compris les adaptations cinématographiques ou toute autre forme dans laquelle l’Œuvre est susceptible d’être refondue, transformée ou adaptée, notamment toute forme dérivée de l’original de manière identifiable. Il est toutefois entendu qu’une Œuvre qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence. Au cas où l’Œuvre serait une création musicale, une interprétation ou un phonogramme, la synchronisation de l’Œuvre avec une image animée sera considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence.
Collection : recueil d’œuvres qui, en raison de la sélection et de l’arrangement de son contenu, constitue une création intellectuelle dans laquelle chaque Œuvre se trouve incluse dans son ensemble, sous une forme non modifiée, avec une ou plusieurs autres contributions, chacune d’elles constituant des œuvres en elles-mêmes indépendantes et distinctes qui sont rassemblées pour former cet ensemble. Constituent notamment des Collections, les encyclopédies, anthologies, interprétations, phonogrammes, vidéogrammes ou émissions, ou toute œuvre autre que celles désignées à l’article 1(f). Aux fins de la présente Licence, une création qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation (telle que définie ci-dessus).
Distribution : mise à disposition du public de la version originale ou des copies de l'Œuvre, par la vente ou tout autre transfert de propriété ou par tout mode de communication au public dans la mesure où ces activités sont sources de droits exclusifs (location, prêt, etc).
Offrant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou la ou les entité(s) qui mettent l’Œuvre à la disposition du public selon les termes de la présente Licence.
Titulaire de Droits Originaire : dans l’hypothèse d’une œuvre littéraire ou artistique, l’Auteur, entendu comme la ou les personnes physiques ou morales ou les entités qui ont créé l'Œuvre; et en outre, le cas échéant, (i) dans l’hypothèse d’une interprétation, les acteurs, chanteurs, musiciens, danseurs, ou toute autre personne qui joue, chante, déclame ou interprète l’œuvre littéraire, artistique ou folklorique; (ii) dans l’hypothèse d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme, le producteur, entendu comme la personne physique ou morale qui procède à la première fixation de l’interprétation sur un support; (iii) dans l’hypothèse d’une émission, l’entreprise de communication audiovisuelle qui procède à la diffusion de l’émission; (iv) dans l’hypothèse d’une base de données, le producteur.
Œuvre : création protégeable par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique (droits d'auteur, droits voisins et droits sui generis des producteurs de bases de données) mise à disposition selon les termes de la Licence. Peuvent notamment constituer une Œuvre toute création dans le domaine littéraire, scientifique et artistique, quel qu'en soit le mode ou la forme d'expression, y compris sous forme numérique, telle qu’un livre, un pamphlet et autres écrits ; une conférence, une allocution, une plaidoirie, un cours ou un sermon ou d'autres œuvres de même nature ; une œuvre dramatique ou une comédie musicale ; une œuvre chorégraphique ou un pantomime ; une composition musicale avec ou sans paroles ; une œuvre cinématographique à laquelle sont assimilées des œuvres exprimées par un procédé analogue à la cinématographie ; un dessin, une peinture, une création architecturale, une sculpture, une gravure ou une lithographie ; une création photographique à laquelle sont assimilées des œuvres exprimées par un procédé analogue à la photographie ; une œuvre des arts appliqués ; une œuvre graphique et typographique ; une illustration, une carte, un plan, un croquis ou une œuvre tridimensionnelle relative à la géographie, la topographie, l'architecture ou aux sciences ; une interprétation, une émission ; un phonogramme ou un vidéogramme ; une anthologie ou un recueil d’œuvres ou de données diverses ou une base de données dans la mesure où elle est protégée par le droit d’auteur ou le droit des producteurs de bases de données à la condition que celles-ci soient protégées par le droit applicable qui ne couvre pas seulement les bases de données protégées par le droit d'auteur (pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les sections 3(a) et 3(b). ne s'appliqueront pas quand seul le droit des producteurs de bases de données s'applique); une interprétation réalisée par un artiste de cirque ou de variété ; les créations des industries saisonnières de l'habillement et de la parure.
Acceptant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou entité(s) qui exercent sur l’Œuvre les droits accordés par cette Licence et qui n’ont pas précédemment violé les conditions de cette Licence ou qui ont reçu l’autorisation expresse de la part de l’Offrant d’exercer les droits conférés par cette licence malgré une violation précédente.
Représentation : représentation de l’Œuvre et communications au public de ces représentations publiques par un procédé quelconque, quelque soit le type de transmission, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d’exploitation prévus par le droit applicable. Constitue également notamment une communication au public, la mise à disposition d’Œuvres protégées de manière à ce que le public puisse y avoir accès de l’endroit et au moment qu’il choisit individuellement, les interprétations et communications au public des interprétations de l'Œuvre y compris les interprétations publiques au format numérique ainsi qu’une diffusion ou une rediffusion de l’Œuvre par tout moyen, notamment par des signes, des sons ou des images.
Reproduction : toute copie de l'Œuvre de quelque manière et sous quelque forme que ce soit, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d'exploitation prévus par le droit applicable. Constitue aussi notamment une Reproduction, un enregistrement sonore ou visuel, une fixation ou une reproduction de fixations de l'Œuvre, y compris le stockage d'une interprétation, d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme au format numérique ou sur tout autre support électronique.
2. Exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs. Les exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs prévues par la loi applicable ne sont pas affectées par la présente Licence.
3. Étendue de l’autorisation. Sous réserve des conditions de la présente Licence, l’Offrant autorise l’Acceptant à exercer à titre gratuit, non-exclusif, pour la durée de protection des droits applicables et pour le monde entier, les droits de :
Reproduire, Distribuer et Représenter l'Œuvre, incorporer l'Œuvre dans une ou plusieurs Collections et reproduire l'Œuvre même incorporée dans lesdites Collections; et
Lorsque l'Œuvre est une base de données soumise au droit des producteurs de bases de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté :
Régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire.  Dans les cas où des utilisations de l'Œuvre seraient soumises à un régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire (auquel le droit ne permet pas de renoncer), l'Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances par l'intermédiaire de la société de perception et de répartition des droits compétente. Sont notamment concernés la radiodiffusion et la communication dans un lieu public de phonogrammes publiés à des fins de commerce, certains cas de retransmission par câble et satellite, la copie privée d'Œuvres fixées sur phonogrammes ou vidéogrammes, la reproduction par reprographie, le prêt en bibliothèque ;
Régime de gestion collective obligatoire assorti de possibilité de renonciation.  Dans les juridictions où il est possible de renoncer au droit de percevoir des redevances au titre d'un quelconque régime de licence légale ou de gestion collective obligatoire, l’Offrant renonce au droit exclusif de percevoir lesdites redevances découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits consentis en vertu de la présente Licence ;
Régime de gestion collective facultative.  L’Offrant renonce au droit de percevoir des redevances (que ce soit à titre individuel ou, au cas où l’Offrant serait membre d’un organisme de gestion collective facultative, par le biais de cet organisme) découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits accordés par la présente Licence.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous supports, médias, procédés, techniques et dans tous formats, incluant, dans la mesure du possible, les futurs médias et formats. Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus incluent le droit d'effectuer les modifications techniquement nécessaires à leur exercice sur d’autres supports, médias, procédés, techniques et formats, sans toutefois inclure le droit de créer des Adaptations. Les droits qui ne sont pas expressément accordés par l’Offrant à l’Acceptant par la présente Licence sont réservés. Dans le cas où l'Offrant est titulaire de droits sui generis sur les bases de données conformément à la loi nationale transposant la Directive Européenne sur les bases de données, l'Offrant renonce à ce droit.
4. Restrictions. L'autorisation accordée par l'Article 3 est expressément soumise et limitée par les restrictions suivantes :
L'Acceptant peut Distribuer ou Représenter l'Œuvre uniquement selon les termes de cette licence. Il doit inclure une copie de la Licence, ou son Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource (URI), à toute copie de l'Œuvre qu'il Distribue ou Représente. L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation sur l'Œuvre qui restreignent les termes de la Licence ou la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur d'exercer les droits qui lui sont accordés par cette Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut consentir de sous-licence sur l'Œuvre. Il doit conserver intacts tous les avertissements qui se réfèrent à cette Licence et l’avertissement sur les garanties avec chaque copie de l’Œuvre qu’il distribue ou représente. Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre, il ne doit pas imposer de mesure technique de protection susceptible de restreindre la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur à exercer les droits conférés par la présente Licence. L’article 4(a) s’applique à l’Œuvre telle qu’incorporée dans une Collection, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que la Collection soit soumise aux conditions de la Licence. Si l'Acceptant crée une Collection, il doit, à la demande de tout Offrant et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de la Collection toute référence audit Offrant, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(b), et ce conformément à la demande.
Sauf introduction d’une demande prévue à l’Article 4(a), l'Acceptant doit, lorsqu'il distribue ou représente l'Œuvre, ou toute Collection, garder intacts tous les avertissements sur les droits d’auteur concernant l’Œuvre et fournir, de manière appropriée au support ou au média qu'il utilise : (i) le nom du Titulaire de Droits Originaire (ou le pseudonyme, le cas échéant) s'il est mentionné, et/ou si le Titulaire de Droits Originaire et/ou l’Offrant désigne une ou des parties (par exemple un organisme de financement, un éditeur ou un journal) à attribuer (« les Parties à Attribuer ») dans l’avertissement sur les droits d’auteur de l’Offrant, les conditions d’utilisation ou, par un autre moyen approprié, le nom de la Partie ou des Parties à Attribuer ; (ii) le titre de l’Œuvre, s’il est mentionné; et (iii) dans la mesure du possible, l’URI que l'Offrant spécifie comme étant associée à l’Œuvre, sauf si ledit URI ne fait pas référence à l’avertissement sur les droits ou aux informations sur la licence relative à l’Œuvre. Les crédits requis par cet article 4(b) pourront être mis en œuvre par tout moyen approprié, sous réserve, toutefois, qu’en cas d'une Collection, ces crédits figurent d’une manière au moins aussi visible que les crédits relatifs aux autres auteurs y ayant contribué, si de tels crédits apparaissent. A toutes fins utiles, l'Acceptant ne pourra utiliser les crédits requis par cet Article qu'à des fins d’attribution, de la manière susmentionnée et en exerçant les droits accordés par la Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut, implicitement ou explicitement, affirmer ou laisser supposer une quelconque relation, parrainage ou aval par le Titulaire de Droits Originaire, l'Offrant, la ou les Parties à Attribuer selon le cas, et l’Acceptant ou son utilisation de l’Œuvre, sans avoir l’autorisation distincte, expresse, écrite et préalable du Titulaire de Droits Originaire, de l'Offrant et/ou des Parties à Attribuer.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les restrictions accordées par l’article 3 et l'article 4(a) ne sont pas applicables à la partie de l’œuvre qui est soumise uniquement aux droits des producteurs de bases de données.
A moins d’une limitation aux droits exclusifs prévue par la loi applicable, si l’Acceptant Reproduit, Distribue ou Représente l’Œuvre en elle-même, ou au sein d’une Collection, il doit respecter les droits moraux du Titulaire de Droits Originaire dans la mesure où ce Titulaire en bénéficie (comme les auteurs et les artistes-interprètes) et ne peut y renoncer.
5. Représentation, Garanties et Avertissement
SAUF ACCORD CONTRAIRE CONVENU PAR ECRIT ENTRE LES PARTIES ET DANS LA LIMITE DU DROIT APPLICABLE, L’OFFRANT MET L’ŒUVRE A DISPOSITION DE L’ACCEPTANT EN L’ETAT, SANS DECLARATION OU GARANTIE D’AUCUNE SORTE, EXPRESSE, IMPLICITE, LÉGALE OU AUTRE. SONT NOTAMMENT EXCLUES LES GARANTIES CONCERNANT LA COMMERCIABILITE, LA CONFORMITE, LES VICES CACHES ET LES VICES APPARENTS.
6. Limitation de responsabilité. A l'exception des garanties d'ordre public imposées par la loi applicable, l'Offrant ne sera en aucun cas tenu responsable vis-à-vis de l'Acceptant, sur la base d'aucune théorie juridique ni en raison d'aucun préjudice direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, résultant de l'exécution du présent Contrat ou de l'utilisation de l'Œuvre, y compris dans l'hypothèse où l'Offrant avait connaissance de la possible existence d'un tel préjudice.
7. Résiliation
Toute violation par l'Acceptant des clauses de cette Licence entraînera sa résiliation automatique et la fin des droits qui en découlent. Les Licences accordées aux personnes physiques ou morales qui ont reçu de la part de l'Acceptant des Collections dans le cadre de la présente Licence ne seront pas résiliées, à condition que lesdites personnes physiques ou morales respectent pleinement leurs obligations. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 de la présente Licence continuent à s'appliquer après la résiliation de celle-ci.
Sous réserve des conditions mentionnées ci-dessus, la présente Licence est accordée pour toute la durée du droit d'auteur ou tout autre droit applicable à l'Œuvre. Néanmoins, l'Offrant se réserve à tout moment le droit d'exploiter l'Œuvre sous une autre Licence ou d'en cesser la Distribution à tout moment. Cependant, cette décision ne devra pas conduire à retirer cette Licence (ou toute autre Licence qui a été accordée, ou doit être accordée en application de la présente Licence) qui continuera à s'appliquer dans tous ses effets à moins qu'elle ne soit résiliée dans les conditions décrites ci-dessus.
8. Divers
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre ou une Collection, l’Offrant accorde au bénéficiaire suivant, une licence sur l’Œuvre avec les mêmes termes et conditions que celle accordée à l’Acceptant.
Si en vertu de la loi applicable, une quelconque disposition de la présente Licence était déclarée nulle, non valide ou inapplicable, cela n'aurait pas pour effet d'annuler ou de rendre inapplicables les autres dispositions de la Licence. Sans action ultérieure des parties, ladite disposition sera modifiée dans la mesure minimum nécessaire à sa validité et son applicabilité.
Aucune des conditions ou des dispositions de la présente Licence ne sera réputée comme ayant fait l'objet d'une renonciation, et aucune violation comme ayant été acceptée, sans le consentement écrit et signé de la partie concernée.
La présente Licence représente l'intégralité de l'accord conclu entre les parties à propos de l'Œuvre, objet de la présente Licence. Il n'existe aucun élément annexe, accord ou mandat portant sur cette Œuvre qui ne soit mentionné ci-dessus. L'Offrant ne sera tenu par aucune disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une communication provenant de l'Acceptant. La présente Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord écrit de l'Offrant et de l'Acceptant.
Avertissements de Creative Commons
Creative Commons n'est pas partie à cette Licence et n'offre aucune forme de garantie relative à l'Œuvre. Creative Commons décline toute responsabilité à l'égard de l'Acceptant ou de toute autre partie, quel que soit le fondement légal de cette responsabilité et quel que soit le préjudice subi, direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, qui surviendrait du fait de cette Licence. Cependant, si Creative Commons s'est expressément identifié comme Offrant pour mettre une Œuvre à disposition selon les termes de cette Licence, Creative Commons jouira de tous les droits et obligations d'un Offrant.
A l'exception des utilisations limitées à indiquer au public que l'Œuvre est mise à disposition sous la licence Creative Commons, Creative Commons n'autorise l'utilisation par aucune partie de la marque « Creative Commons » ou de toute autre indication ou logo de Creative Commons sans le consentement écrit préalable de Creative Commons. Toute utilisation autorisée devra se conformer aux directives d'utilisation de la marque en vigueur telles qu'elles pourront être publiées sur le site web ou sur demande. Cette restriction relative à la marque ne constitue pas une partie de cette Licence.

Βάσει των όρων και προϋποθέσεων της Άδειας αυτής, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια με το παρόν ιδιωτικό συμφωνητικό Σας παρέχει μια παγκόσμια, χωρίς πληρωμή (πνευματικών ή συγγενικών) δικαιωμάτων, μη αποκλειστική, διαρκή άδεια να ασκείτε τα δικαιώματα στo αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης όπως προσδιορίζεται παρακάτω:
α.
Να αναπαράγετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, να ενσωματώνετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης σε ένα ή περισσότερα Συλλογικά Έργα και να αναπαράγετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης που έχει ενσωματωθεί σε Συλλογικά Έργα.

ε.
Προς άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, γίνεται δεκτό ότι:
Υποχρεωτικές αδειοδοτήσεις μη δεκτικές παραίτησης: Στην περίπτωση υποχρεωτικών αδειοδοτήσεων στις οποίες δεν είναι δυνατή η παραίτηση (για παράδειγμα, αναφορικά με την είσπραξη αμοιβών για πνευματικά δικαιώματα) ο Χορηγών την Άδεια διατηρεί το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει τέτοιες αμοιβές είτε για εμπορική είτε για μη εμπορική χρήση του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης.
Φορείς Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων: Ο Χορηγών την Άδεια παραιτείται από το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει (είτε ατομικά είτε μέσω Οργανισμού Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων, στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι μέλος τέτοιου φορέα) αμοιβές για πνευματικά δικαιώματα αναφορικά με μη εμπορικές χρήσεις του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης. Ο Χορηγών την Άδεια διατηρεί το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει (είτε ατομικά είτε μέσω Οργανισμού Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων, στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι μέλος τέτοιου φορέα) αμοιβές για πνευματικά δικαιώματα αναφορικά με εμπορικές χρήσεις του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης.
Τα ανωτέρω δικαιώματα μπορούν να ασκηθούν με όλα τα τεχνικά μέσα και σε όλους τους υλικούς φορείς ενσωμάτωσης αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Τα ανωτέρω δικαιώματα περιλαμβάνουν το δικαίωμα να γίνονται αυτές οι μετατροπές οι οποίες είναι τεχνικά αναγκαίες για την άσκηση των δικαιωμάτων σε άλλα τεχνικά μέσα και υλικούς φορείς ενσωμάτωσης αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Υπάρχει επιφύλαξη υπέρ του δικαιούχου για όλα τα δικαιώματα που δεν παρέχονται σαφώς από τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, όπως ενδεικτικά και όχι περιοριστικά αναφέρονται τα δικαιώματα της Ρήτρας 4(δ).
Στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι δικαιούχος του δικαιώματος ειδικής φύσης (sui generis) του κατασκευαστή βάσης δεδομένων σύμφωνα με τον Ελληνικό νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας, όπως αυτό ισχύει κατ’ εφαρμογή στο Ελληνικό Δίκαιο της Οδηγίας 96/9/ΕΟΚ για τη νομική προστασία των βάσεων δεδομένων, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια παραιτείται αυτού του δικαιώματός του.
4. Περιορισμοί
Η παρεχόμενη άδεια βάσει της Ρήτρας 3 όπως προσδιορίζεται παραπάνω υπόκειται στους εξής περιορισμούς:
α.
Μπορείτε να προβείτε σε διανομή, ή δημόσια εκτέλεση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης μόνον βάσει των όρων της παρούσας Άδειας. Είστε υποχρεωμένοι να περιλάβετε ένα αντίγραφο αυτής της Άδειας ή το Κανονιστικό Αναγνωριστικό Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier) της Άδειας αυτής σε κάθε αντίγραφο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης το οποίο διανέμετε, ή εκτελείτε δημοσίως. Δεν μπορείτε να επιβάλλετε όρους στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης οι οποίοι περιορίζουν τους όρους της Άδειας ή την άσκηση από τον λήπτη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης των δικαιωμάτων που παρέχονται σ’ αυτόν υπό τους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Δεν μπορείτε να χορηγήσετε άδεια περαιτέρω εκμετάλλευσης του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Πρέπει να τηρείτε άθικτες όλες τις γνωστοποιήσεις που αφορούν την Άδεια αυτή και τους περιορισμούς της ευθύνης σε κάθε αντίγραφο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που διανέμετε ή παρουσιάζετε δημόσια. Σε κάθε διανομή ή δημόσια παρουσίαση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης, δεν επιτρέπετε να κάνετε χρήση οποιουδήποτε τεχνολογικού μέτρου επί του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που έχει ως αποτέλεσμα τον περιορισμό της άσκησης από τον λήπτη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης των δικαιωμάτων που παρέχονται σ’ αυτόν υπό τους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Η παρούσα Ρήτρα 4(α) ισχύει για το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης που είναι ενσωματωμένο σε Συλλογικό Έργο, αλλά δεν απαιτείται το Συλλογικό Έργο ξεχωριστά από το ίδιο το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης να υπόκειται στους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Αν δημιουργείτε Συλλογικό Έργο, εφόσον γίνει γνωστοποίηση από τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, πρέπει, στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατόν, να αφαιρέσετε από το Συλλογικό Έργο κάθε αναφορά σε δικαιούχο όπως αυτό απαιτείται από τη Ρήτρα 4(δ).
β.
Αν διανείμετε, ή παρουσιάζετε στο κοινό το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης ή το Συλλογικό Έργο, πρέπει, εφόσον δεν έχει υποβληθεί αίτημα σχετικό με τη Ρήτρα 4(α), να κρατήσετε άθικτες όλες τις πληροφορίες για το δικαιούχο πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας και να παρέχετε, ανάλογα με το μέσον ή τα μέσα που χρησιμοποιείτε: (1) το όνομα (ή το ψευδώνυμο) του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή του Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων αν υπάρχει και/ή (2) αν ο Πρώτος Δημιουργός (Αρχικός Δικαιούχος) ή ο Δικαιούχος Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων και/ή ο Χορηγών την Άδεια ορίσει, στους όρους χρήσης ή σε άλλο σχετικό μέσο, άλλον ή άλλους (π.χ. ένα ινστιτούτο, εκδότη, περιοδικό) αναφορικά με τις πληροφορίες για τα δικαιώματα πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας όσον αφορά τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, το όνομα αυτού ή αυτών («Δικαιούχοι»). Επίσης, τον τίτλο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης αν υπάρχει, και (3) στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατό, το Κανονιστικό Αναγνωριστικό Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier), αν υπάρχει, το οποίο ο Χορηγών την Άδεια προσδιορίζει συνδεόμενο με το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, εκτός αν αυτό το Κανονιστικό Αναγνώρισης Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier) δεν αναφέρεται στις πληροφορίες για την πνευματική ιδιοκτησία ή στις πληροφορίες χορήγησης άδειας για το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης. Αυτή η αναφορά που απαιτείται σύμφωνα με τη Ρήτρα 4(γ) μπορεί να γίνει με οποιονδήποτε εύλογο τρόπο, υπό τον όρο, όμως, ότι στην περίπτωση Συλλογικού Έργου, κατ’ ελάχιστη προϋπόθεση αυτή η αναφορά θα φαίνεται όπου εμφανίζεται οποιαδήποτε άλλη ανάλογη αναφορά δικαιούχου για συγγραφικό δικαίωμα και κατά τρόπο τουλάχιστον τόσο εμφανή όπως αυτή η άλλη ανάλογη αναφορά δικαιούχου για συγγραφικό δικαίωμα. Για την άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, μπορείτε να χρησιμοποιήσετε τις αναφορές που απαιτούνται από αυτή τη Ρήτρα για το σκοπό της πληροφόρησης περί το δικαιούχο πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας όπως ορίζεται παραπάνω, και επιπλέον κατά την άσκηση των δικαιωμάτων Σας υπό τους όρους αυτής της Άδειας, δεν μπορείτε έμμεσα ή άμεσα να επικαλεστείτε ή εννοήσετε την ύπαρξη οποιασδήποτε σχέσης ή έγκρισης από τον Πρώτο Δημιουργό (Αρχικό Δικαιούχο) ή τον Δικαιούχο Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων, τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, ή το Δικαιούχο που αφορά Εσάς ή τις χρήσεις του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης από Εσάς, χωρίς ταυτόχρονα να την αποδεικνύετε με ξεχωριστή, έγγραφη άδεια του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή του Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων, του Χορηγούντα την Άδεια ή του Δικαιούχου.
γ.
Προς άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, οι περιορισμοί που αναφέρονται παραπάνω [4(α), 4(β)] δεν εφαρμόζονται σ’ αυτά τα μέρη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που περιλαμβάνονται στον ορισμό «Αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης» αυτής της Άδειας αποκλειστικά επειδή συνιστούν αντικείμενο του δικαιώματος ειδικής φύσης (sui generis) του κατασκευαστή βάσης δεδομένων σύμφωνα με τον Ελληνικό νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας κατ’ εφαρμογή της Οδηγίας 96/9/ΕΟΚ.
δ.
Όλες οι εξουσίες του ηθικού δικαιώματος παραμένουν αναλλοίωτες στο βαθμό που προβλέπονται στον εφαρμοστέο νόμο και δεν είναι δεκτικές παραίτησης.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE A SOLICITOR-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT, RELATED RIGHTS, SUI GENERIS DATABASE RIGHT, AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
This Licence enables You (all capitalised terms defined below) to view and Distribute the Work worldwide provided that You credit the Original Author and comply with the other terms and conditions of this Licence.
'The Licensor' (one or more natural or legal persons offering the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence)
and
'You' (the natural or legal person acquiring rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.)
agree as follows:
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole, which by reason of the selection and arrangement of its contents constitutes an intellectual creation.
"Derivative Work" means any work created by the editing, modification, adaptation or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"Original Author" means the natural or legal person or persons that created the Work.
"Performance" means (i) a performance of any actors, singers, musicians, dancers or other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works or expressions of works of folklore, which is a live performance given by one or more individuals, and shall include a performance of a variety act or any similar presentation or (ii) a broadcast or rebroadcast of the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. A performance of a literary work includes a reading or recitation and a performance of a dramatic work includes a choreographic work or a work of mime. “Perform” shall be construed accordingly.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
"Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. For the purposes of this Licence a Work shall also be taken to mean a live Performance or a database insofar as these are protected under the applicable law within Your jurisdiction.
For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number.
2. Fair Dealing Rights Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses or rights permitted under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.
3. Licence Grant Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, the Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below for the duration of copyright, related right and/or sui generis database right in the Work.
to Reproduce the Work;
to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works;
to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work;
to Distribute or Perform the Work, or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work to the public in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter created.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise You have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(c) and Section 6.
Where the Licensor is the owner of the sui generis database rights under national law implementing Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases, the Licensor waives these rights.
4. Restrictions The Licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence. You must make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and Collective Works Distributed or Performed by You. You may not offer or impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work that restrict the terms of this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to the recipient under the terms of the Licence. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. When You Distribute or Perform the Work, You must not impose any effective technological measures on the Work or the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Licence. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Perform the Work or any Collective Work, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilising: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; and (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this Licence, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and not waivable by applicable law.
For the avoidance of doubt: The restrictions mentioned above (4(a) and 4(b)) do not apply to those parts of the Work considered to fall within the definition of a "Work" under this Licence exclusively because they meet the criteria of the sui generis database right under national law implementing Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases.
Additional Provisions for recipients making use of the Work
5. Further licence from the Licensor
Each time You Distribute or Perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the relevant recipient a licence to use the Work on the same terms and conditions as the Licence granted to You hereunder.
6. Reservation and Waiver of Rights
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory Licence Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence;
Waivable Compulsory Licence Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence; and,
Voluntary Licence Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
7. Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as required by law, the Work is licensed by the Licensor on an "as is" and "as available" basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
8. Limit of Liability
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.
9. Termination
This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Natural or legal persons who have received Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such natural or legal persons remain in full compliance with those Licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this Licence.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright, related right and/or sui generis database right in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
10. General
The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this Licence is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or unenforceable.
This Licence constitutes the entire licence between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication in any form.
No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
Creative Commons Notice
Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this Licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

Creative Commons Codice Legale
Attribuzione - Non opere derivate 3.0 Italia
 
L'ASSOCIAZIONE CREATIVE COMMONS (DI SEGUITO "CREATIVE COMMONS") NON È UNO STUDIO LEGALE E NON FORNISCE SERVIZI DI CONSULENZA LEGALE. LA DISTRIBUZIONE DI QUESTO MODELLO DI CONTRATTO DI LICENZA NON INSTAURA UN RAPPORTO AVVOCATO-CLIENTE. CREATIVE COMMONS FORNISCE INFORMAZIONI DA CONSIDERARSI "COSÌ COME SONO". CREATIVE COMMONS NON PRESTA ALCUNA GARANZIA PER LE INFORMAZIONI FORNITE E SI ESIME DA OGNI RESPONSABILITÀ PER I DANNI DERIVANTI DALL'USO DELLE STESSE.
La Licenza
L'OPERA (COME SOTTO DEFINITA) È MESSA A DISPOSIZIONE SULLA BASE DEI TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA "CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE" ("CCPL" O "LICENZA"). L'OPERA È PROTETTA DAL DIRITTO D'AUTORE, DAGLI ALTRI DIRITTI ATTRIBUITI DALLA LEGGE SUL DIRITTO D'AUTORE (DIRITTI CONNESSI, DIRITTI SULLE BANCHE DATI, ECC.) E/O DALLE ALTRE LEGGI APPLICABILI. OGNI UTILIZZAZIONE DELL'OPERA CHE NON SIA AUTORIZZATA AI SENSI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA E/O DELLE ALTRE LEGGI APPLICABILI È PROIBITA.
CON IL SEMPLICE ESERCIZIO SULL'OPERA DI UNO QUALUNQUE DEI DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI, TU ACCETTI E TI OBBLIGHI A RISPETTARE INTEGRALMENTE I TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA. IL LICENZIANTE CONCEDE A TE I DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI A CONDIZIONE CHE TU ACCETTI DI RISPETTARE I TERMINI E LE CONDIZIONI DI CUI ALLA PRESENTE LICENZA.
Art. 1 - Definizioni
Ai fini e per gli effetti della presente licenza, si intende per
"Collezione di Opere", un'opera, come un numero di un periodico, un'antologia o un'enciclopedia, nella quale l'Opera nella sua interezza e forma originale, unitamente ad altri contributi costituenti loro stessi opere distinte ed autonome, sono raccolti in un'unità collettiva. Un'opera che costituisce Collezione di Opere non verrà considerata Opera Derivata (come sotto definita) ai fini della presente Licenza;
"Opera Derivata", un'opera basata sull'Opera ovvero sull'Opera insieme con altre opere preesistenti, come una traduzione, un arrangiamento musicale, un adattamento teatrale, narrativo, cinematografico, una registrazione di suoni, una riproduzione d'arte, un digesto, una sintesi, o ogni altra forma in cui l'Opera possa essere riproposta, trasformata o adattata. Nel caso in cui un'Opera tra quelle qui descritte costituisca già Collezione di Opere, essa non sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini della presente Licenza. Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, quando l'Opera sia una composizione musicale o registrazione di suoni, la sincronizzazione dell'Opera in relazione con un'immagine in movimento ("synching") sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini di questa Licenza;
"Licenziante", l'individuo, gli individui, l'ente o gli enti che offre o offrono l'Opera secondo i termini e le condizioni della presente Licenza;
"Autore Originario", il soggetto o i soggetti che ha o hanno creato l'Opera;
"Opera", l'opera dell'ingegno o, comunque, qualsiasi bene o prestazione suscettibile di protezione in forza delle leggi sul diritto d'autore (diritto d'autore, diritti connessi, diritto sui generis sulle banche dati, ecc.), la cui utilizzazione è offerta nel rispetto dei termini della presente Licenza;
"Tu"/"Te", l'individuo o l'ente che esercita i diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza e che non abbia precedentemente violato i termini della presente Licenza relativi all'Opera o che, nonostante una precedente violazione degli stessi, abbia ricevuto espressa autorizzazione dal Licenziante all'esercizio dei diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza.
Art. 2 - Libere Utilizzazioni
La presente Licenza non intende in alcun modo ridurre, limitare o restringere alcuna utilizzazione non protetta dal diritto d'autore o alcun diritto di libera utilizzazione o l'operare della regola dell'esaurimento del diritto o altre limitazioni dei diritti sull'Opera derivanti dalle leggi applicabili.
Art. 3 - Concessione della Licenza
Nel rispetto dei termini e delle condizioni contenute nella presente Licenza, il Licenziante concede a Te una licenza per tutto il mondo, gratuita, non esclusiva e perpetua (per la durata del diritto d'autore applicabile) che autorizza ad esercitare i diritti sull'Opera qui di seguito elencati:
riproduzione dell'Opera, incorporazione dell'Opera in una o più Collezioni di Opere e riproduzione dell'Opera come incorporata nelle Collezioni di Opere;
distribuzione di copie dell'Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera è registrata, noleggio e prestito di copie dell'Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale dell'Opera, e ciò anche quando l'Opera sia incorporata in Collezioni di Opere.
Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, se l'Opera sia di tipo musicale:
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione o esecuzione di opere incluse in repertori. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione o esecuzione, anche in forma digitale (ad es. tramite webcast) dell'Opera.
Compensi per versioni cover. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per ogni disco che Tu crei e distribuisci a partire dall'Opera (versione cover).
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico dell'Opera mediante fonogrammi. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che se l'Opera è una registrazione di suoni, il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. IMAIE), per la comunicazione al pubblico dell'Opera, anche in forma digitale.
Altri compensi previsti dalla legge italiana. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere i compensi a lui attribuiti dalla legge italiana sul diritto d'autore (ad es. per l'inserimento dell'Opera in un'antologia ad uso scolastico ex art. 70 l. 633/1941). Al Licenziante spettano in ogni caso i compensi irrinunciabili a lui attribuiti dalla medesima legge (ad es. l'equo compenso spettante all'autore di opere musicali, cinematografiche, audiovisive o di sequenze di immagini in movimento nel caso di noleggio ai sensi dell'art. 18-bis l. 633/1941).
I diritti sopra descritti potranno essere esercitati con ogni mezzo di comunicazione e in tutti i formati. Tra i diritti di cui sopra si intende compreso il diritto di apportare all'Opera le modifiche che si rendessero tecnicamente necessarie per l'esercizio di detti diritti tramite altri mezzi di comunicazione o su altri formati. Tale diritto non riguarda la creazione di Opere Derivate, che rimane assolutamente ed esclusivamente riservata in capo al Licenziante. Tutti i diritti non espressamente concessi dal Licenziante rimangono riservati. Tutti i diritti morali irrinunciabili riconosciuti dalla legge applicabile rimangono riservati.
Qualora l'Opera concessa in licenza includa una o più banche dati sulle quali il Licenziante è titolare di un diritto sui generis ai sensi delle norme nazionali di attuazione della Direttiva 96/9/CE sulle banche dati, il Licenziante rinuncia a far valere il diritto corrispondente.
Art. 4 - Restrizioni
La Licenza concessa in conformità al precedente punto 3 è espressamente assoggettata a, e limitata da, le seguenti restrizioni:
Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l'Opera, anche in forma digitale, solo alle condizioni della presente Licenza e, insieme ad ogni copia dell'Opera (o supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l'Opera) che distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi proporre o imporre alcuna condizione relativa all'Opera che restringa i termini della presente Licenza o la capacità da parte di chi riceve l'Opera di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la presente Licenza. Non puoi concedere l'Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all'esclusione delle garanzie. Quando distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico l'Opera, non puoi utilizzare alcuna misura tecnologica tale da limitare la capacità di chiunque riceva l'Opera da Te di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la presente licenza. Questo art. 4.a si applica all'Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di per sé ed indipendentemente dall'Opera stessa debba essere soggetta ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante, devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente possibile, ogni riferimento in accordo con quanto previsto dall'art. 4.b, come da richiesta.
Qualora Tu distribuisca, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegua, reciti o esponga in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, l'Opera (come definita dal succitato art. 1) o Collezione di Opere (come definita dal succitato art. 1), a meno che sia stata avanzata una richiesta ai sensi dell'art. 4.a, devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative sul diritto d'autore sull'Opera. Devi riconoscere una menzione adeguata rispetto al mezzo di comunicazione o supporto che utilizzi: (i) all'Autore Originario citando il suo nome (o lo pseudonimo, se del caso), ove fornito; e/o (ii) alle terze parti designate, se l'Autore Originario e/o il Licenziante hanno designato una o più terze parti (ad esempio, una istituzione finanziatrice, un ente editoriale, un giornale) ("Parti Designate") perché siano citate nell'informativa sul diritto d'autore del Licenziante o nei termini di servizio o con altri mezzi ragionevoli; (iii) il titolo dell'Opera, se indicato; (iv) nella misura in cui sia ragionevolmente possibile, l'Uniform Resource Identifier, che il Licenziante specifichi dover essere associato con l'Opera, salvo che tale URI non faccia alcun riferimento alla informativa sul diritto d'autore o non dia informazioni sulla licenza dell'Opera. La menzione richiesta dal presente art. 4.b può essere realizzata in qualsiasi maniera ragionevole possibile; in ogni caso, in ipotesi di Collezione di Opere, qualora compaia una menzione di tutti i coautori della Collezione di Opere, allora essa deve essere parte di tale menzione e deve apparire con lo stesso risalto concesso alla menzione degli altri coautori. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che la menzione di cui al presente articolo ha lo scopo di riconoscere la paternità dell'Opera nei modi sopra indicati e che, esercitando i Tuoi diritti ai sensi della presente Licenza, Tu non puoi implicitamente o esplicitamente affermare o fare intendere un qualsiasi collegamento con l'Autore Originario, il Licenziante e/o le Parti Designate, o che l'Autore Originario, il Licenziante e/o le Parti Designate sponsorizzino o avallino Te o il Tuo utilizzo dell'Opera, a meno che non sussista un apposito, espresso e preventivo consenso scritto dell'Autore Originario, del Licenziante e/o delle Parti Designate.
Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che le restrizioni di cui ai precedenti punti 4.a e 4.b non si applicano a quelle parti dell'opera che siano da considerarsi Opera ai sensi della presente Licenza solo in quanto protette dal diritto sui generis su banca dati ai sensi delle norme nazionali di attuazione della Direttiva 96/9/CE sulle banche dati.
Art. 5 - Dichiarazioni, Garanzie ed Esonero da responsabilità
SALVO CHE SIA ESPRESSAMENTE CONVENUTO ALTRIMENTI PER ISCRITTO FRA LE PARTI, IL LICENZIANTE OFFRE L'OPERA IN LICENZA "COSÌ COM'È" E NON FORNISCE ALCUNA DICHIARAZIONE O GARANZIA DI QUALSIASI TIPO CON RIGUARDO ALL'OPERA, SIA ESSA ESPRESSA O IMPLICITA, DI FONTE LEGALE O DI ALTRO TIPO, ESSENDO QUINDI ESCLUSE, FRA LE ALTRE, LE GARANZIE RELATIVE AL TITOLO, ALLA COMMERCIABILITÀ, ALL'IDONEITÀ PER UN FINE SPECIFICO E ALLA NON VIOLAZIONE DI DIRITTI DI TERZI O ALLA MANCANZA DI DIFETTI LATENTI O DI ALTRO TIPO, ALL'ESATTEZZA O ALLA PRESENZA DI ERRORI, SIANO ESSI ACCERTABILI O MENO. ALCUNE GIURISDIZIONI NON CONSENTONO L'ESCLUSIONE DI GARANZIE IMPLICITE E QUINDI TALE ESCLUSIONE PUÒ NON APPLICARSI A TE.
Art. 6 - Limitazione di Responsabilità
SALVI I LIMITI STABILITI DALLA LEGGE APPLICABILE, IL LICENZIANTE NON SARÀ IN ALCUN CASO RESPONSABILE NEI TUOI CONFRONTI A QUALUNQUE TITOLO PER ALCUN TIPO DI DANNO, SIA ESSO SPECIALE, INCIDENTALE, CONSEQUENZIALE, PUNITIVO O ESEMPLARE, DERIVANTE DALLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DALL'USO DELL'OPERA, ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL LICENZIANTE SIA STATO EDOTTO SULLA POSSIBILITÀ DI TALI DANNI. NESSUNA CLAUSOLA DI QUESTA LICENZA ESCLUDE O LIMITA LA RESPONSABILITÀ NEL CASO IN CUI QUESTA DIPENDA DA DOLO O COLPA GRAVE.
Art. 7 - Risoluzione
La presente Licenza si intenderà risolta di diritto e i diritti con essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente, senza necessità di alcuna comunicazione in tal senso da parte del Licenziante, in caso di qualsivoglia inadempimento dei termini della presente Licenza da parte Tua, ed in particolare delle disposizioni di cui ai punti 4.a e/o 4.b, essendo la presente Licenza condizionata risolutivamente al verificarsi di tali inadempimenti. In ogni caso, la risoluzione della presente Licenza non pregiudicherà i diritti acquisiti da individui o enti che abbiano acquisito da Te Collezioni di Opere, ai sensi della presente Licenza, a condizione che tali individui o enti continuino a rispettare integralmente le licenze di cui sono parte. Le sezioni 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 rimangono valide in presenza di qualsiasi risoluzione della presente Licenza.
Sempre che vengano rispettati i termini e le condizioni di cui sopra, la presente Licenza è perpetua (e concessa per tutta la durata del diritto d'autore applicabile sull'Opera). Nonostante ciò, il Licenziante si riserva il diritto di rilasciare l'Opera sulla base dei termini di una differente licenza o di cessare la distribuzione dell'Opera in qualsiasi momento; fermo restando che, in ogni caso, tali decisioni non comporteranno recesso dalla presente Licenza (o da qualsiasi altra licenza che sia stata concessa, o che sia richiesto che venga concessa, ai termini della presente Licenza), e la presente Licenza continuerà ad avere piena efficacia, salvo che vi sia risoluzione come sopra indicato.
Art. 8 - Varie
Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti pubblicamente in forma digitale l'Opera o una Collezione di Opere, il Licenziante offre al destinatario una licenza per l'Opera nei medesimi termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi tramite la presente Licenza.
L'invalidità o l'inefficacia, secondo la legge applicabile, di una o più fra le disposizioni della presente Licenza, non comporterà l'invalidità o l'inefficacia dei restanti termini e, senza bisogno di ulteriori azioni delle parti, le disposizioni invalide o inefficaci saranno da intendersi rettificate nei limiti della misura che sia indispensabile per renderle valide ed efficaci.
In nessun caso i termini e le disposizioni di cui alla presente Licenza possono essere considerati rinunciati, né alcuna violazione può essere considerata consentita, salvo che tale rinuncia o consenso risultino per iscritto da una dichiarazione firmata dalla parte contro cui operi tale rinuncia o consenso.
La presente Licenza costituisce l'intero accordo tra le parti relativamente all'Opera qui data in licenza. Non esistono altre intese, accordi o dichiarazioni relative all'Opera che non siano quelle qui specificate. Il Licenziante non sarà vincolato ad alcuna altra disposizione addizionale che possa apparire in alcuna comunicazione da Te proveniente. La presente Licenza non può essere modificata senza il mutuo consenso scritto del Licenziante e Tuo.
La presente licenza è stata redatta sulla base della legge italiana, in particolare del Codice Civile del 1942 e della legge 22 Aprile 1941, n. 633 e successive modificazioni sulla protezione del diritto d'autore e di altri diritti connessi al suo esercizio.
Nota Finale
Creative Commons non è parte della presente Licenza e non dà alcuna garanzia connessa all'Opera. Creative Commons non è responsabile nei Tuoi confronti o nei confronti di altre parti ad alcun titolo per alcun danno, incluso, senza limitazioni, qualsiasi danno generale, speciale, incidentale o consequenziale che sorga in connessione alla presente Licenza. Nonostante quanto previsto nelle due precedenti frasi, qualora Creative Commons espressamente identificasse se stesso quale Licenziante nei termini di cui al presente accordo, avrà tutti i diritti e tutti gli obblighi del Licenziante.
Salvo che per il solo scopo di indicare al pubblico che l'Opera è data in licenza secondo i termini di una CCPL, nessuna parte potrà utilizzare il marchio "Creative Commons" o qualsiasi altro marchio correlato, o il logo di Creative Commons, senza il preventivo consenso scritto di Creative Commons. Ogni uso consentito sarà realizzato in osservanza delle linee guida per l'uso del marchio Creative Commons, in forza in quel momento, come di volta in volta pubblicate sul sito Internet di Creative Commons o altrimenti messe a disposizione a richiesta. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che questa restrizione all'uso del marchio non fa parte della Licenza.

1. Definities
'Verzamelwerk' een werk waarin het Werk, in zijn geheel en in ongewijzigde vorm, samen met een of meer andere werken, die elk een afzonderlijk en zelfstandig werk vormen, tot een geheel is samengevoegd. Voorbeelden van een verzamelwerk zijn een tijdschrift, een bloemlezing of een encyclopedie. Een Verzamelwerk zal voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk (als hieronder omschreven) worden beschouwd.
'Afgeleid werk' een werk dat is gebaseerd op het Werk of op het Werk en andere reeds bestaande werken. Voorbeelden van een Afgeleid werk zijn een vertaling, een muziekschikking (arrangement), een toneelbewerking, een literaire bewerking, een verfilming, een geluidsopname, een kunstreproductie, een verkorte versie, een samenvatting of enig andere bewerking van het Werk, met dien verstande dat een Verzamelwerk voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk zal worden beschouwd. Indien het Werk een muziekwerk betreft, zal de synchronisatie van de tijdslijnen van het Werk en een bewegend beeld ('synching') voor de toepassing van deze Licentie als een Afgeleid Werk worden beschouwd.
'Licentiegever' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/rechtspersonen die het Werk volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie aanbiedt/aanbieden.
'Maker' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/personen die het oorspronkelijke werk gemaakt heeft/hebben. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder de Maker mede verstaan de uitvoerende kunstenaar, film- en fonogramproducent en omroeporganisaties in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de producent van een databank in de zin van de Databankenwet.
'Werk' het auteursrechtelijk beschermde werk dat volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie wordt aangeboden. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder het Werk mede verstaan het fonogram, de eerste vastlegging van een film en het (omroep)programma in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de databank in de zin van de Databankenwet, voor zover dit fonogram, deze eerste vastlegging van een film, dit (omroep)programma en deze databank beschermd wordt krachtens de toepasselijke wet in de jurisdictie van de Gebruiker.
'Gebruiker' de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon die rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uitoefent en die de voorwaarden van deze Licentie met betrekking tot het Werk niet eerder geschonden heeft, of die van de Licentiegever uitdrukkelijke toestemming gekregen heeft om rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uit te oefenen ondanks een eerdere schending.
2. Beperkingen van de uitsluitende rechten. Niets in deze Licentie strekt ertoe om de rechten te beperken die voortvloeien uit de beperkingen en uitputting van de uitsluitende rechten van de rechthebbende krachtens het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het databankenrecht of enige andere toepasselijke rechten.
3. Licentieverlening. Met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie verleent de Licentiegever hierbij aan de Gebruiker een wereldwijde, niet-exclusieve licentie om de navolgende rechten met betrekking tot het Werk vrij van royalty's uit te oefenen voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten:
het reproduceren van het Werk, het opnemen van het Werk in een of meerdere Verzamelwerken, en het reproduceren van het in de Verzamelwerken opgenomen Werk;
het verspreiden van exemplaren van het Werk, het in het openbaar tonen, op- en uitvoeren en het on-line beschikbaar stellen van het Werk, afzonderlijk en als deel van een Verzamelwerk;
het opvragen en hergebruiken van het Werk;
Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat:
Niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen. in het geval van niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot thuiskopieën) de Licentiegever zich het recht voorbehoudt om dergelijke heffingen te innen (al dan niet door middel van een auteursrechtenorganisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk;
Voor afstand vatbare heffingsregeling. in het geval van voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot leenrechten) de Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om dergelijke heffingen te innen bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk;
Collectief rechtenbeheer. de Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om vergoedingen te innen (zelfstandig of, indien de Licentiegever lid is van een auteursrechtenorganisatie, door middel van die organisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk.
De Gebruiker mag deze rechten uitoefenen met behulp van alle thans bekende media, dragers en formats. De Gebruiker is tevens gerechtigd om technische wijzigingen aan te brengen die noodzakelijk zijn om de rechten met behulp van andere media, dragers en formats uit te oefenen, maar is verder niet gerechtigd om Afgeleide Werken te maken. Alle niet uitdrukkelijk verleende rechten zijn hierbij voorbehouden aan de Licentiegever, met inbegrip van maar niet beperkt tot de rechten die in artikel 4(d) worden genoemd. Voor zover de Licentiegever op basis van het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn over uitsluitende rechten beschickt doet de Licentiegever afstand van deze rechten.
4. Beperkingen. De in artikel 3 verleende Licentie is uitdrukkelijk gebonden aan de volgende beperkingen:
De Gebruiker mag het Werk uitsluitend verspreiden, in het openbaar tonen, op- of on-line beschikbaar stellen met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie, en de Gebruiker dient een exemplaar van, of de Uniform Resource Identifier voor, deze Licentie toe te voegen aan elk exemplaar van het Werk dat de Gebruiker verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert, of on-line beschikbaar stelt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk onder enige afwijkende voorwaarden aan te bieden waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk in sublicentie te geven. De Gebruiker dient alle vermeldingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie dan wel naar de uitsluiting van garantie te laten staan. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk te verspreiden, in het openbaar te tonen, op- of uit te voeren of on-line beschikbaar te stellen met toepassing van technologische voorzieningen waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het voorgaande is tevens van toepassing op het Werk dat deel uitmaakt van een Verzamelwerk, maar dat houdt niet in dat het Verzamelwerk, afgezien van het Werk zelf, gebonden is aan de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. Indien de Gebruiker een Verzamelwerk maakt, dient deze, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, de op grond van artikel 4(b) vereiste naamsvermelding uit het Verzamelwerk te verwijderen, voor zover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek.
Indien de Gebruiker het Werk of Verzamelwerken verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert of on-line beschikbaar stelt, dient de Gebruiker, tenzij er sprake is van een verzoek als vermeld in lid 4(a), alle auteursrechtvermeldingen met betrekking tot het Werk te laten staan. Tevens dient de Gebruiker, op een wijze die redelijk is in verhouding tot het gebruikte medium, de naam te vermelden van (i) de Maker(of zijn/haar pseudoniem indien van toepassing) indien deze wordt vermeld; en/of (ii) van (een) andere partij(en) (b.v. sponsor, uitgeverij, tijdschrift) indien de naamsvermelding van deze partij(en) ("Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden") in de auteursrechtvermelding of algemene voorwaarden van de Licentiegever of op een andere redelijke wijze verplicht is gesteld door de Maker en/of de Licentiegever; de titel van het Werk indien deze wordt vermeld; voorzover redelijkerwijs toepasbaar de Uniform Resource Identifier, indien aanwezig, waarvan de Licentiegever heeft aangegeven dat deze bij het Werk hoort, tenzij de URI niet verwijst naar de auteursrechtvermeldingen of de licentie-informatie betreffende het Werk. De Gebruiker dient op redelijke wijze aan de in dit artikel genoemde vereisten te voldoen; echter, met dien verstande dat, in geval van een Verzamelwerk, de naamsvermeldingen in ieder geval geplaatst dienen te worden, indien er een naamsvermelding van alle makers van het Verzamelwerk geplaatst wordt dan als deel van die naamsvermeldingen, en op een wijze die in ieder geval even duidelijk is als de naamsvermeldingen van de overige makers. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat de Gebruiker uitsluitend gebruik mag maken van de naamsvermelding op de in dit artikel omschreven wijze teneinde te voldoen aan de naamsvermeldingsverplichting en, door gebruikmaking van zijn rechten krachtens deze Licentie, is het de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om op enigerlei wijze de indruk te wekken dat er sprake is van enig verband met, sponsorschap van of goedkeuring van de (toepasselijke) Maker, Licentiegever c.q. Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden van de Gebruiker of diens gebruik van het Werk, zonder de afzonderlijke, uitdrukkelijke, voorafgaande, schriftelijke toestemming van de Maker, Licentiegever c.q. Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden.
Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld, dat de hierboven vermelde beperkingen (lid 4(a) en lid 4(b)) niet van toepassing zijn op die onderdelen van het Werk die geacht worden te vallen onder de definitie van het 'Werk' zoals vermeld in deze Licentie uitsluitend omdat zij voldoen aan de criteria van het sui generis databankenrecht krachtens het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn.
De in artikel 3 verleende rechten moeten worden uitgeoefend met inachtneming van het morele recht van de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) om zich te verzetten tegen elke misvorming, verminking of andere aantasting van het werk, welke nadeel zou kunnen toebrengen aan de eer of de naam van de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) of aan zijn waarde in deze hoedanigheid, indien en voor zover de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) op grond van een op hem van toepassing zijnde wettelijke bepaling geen afstand kan doen van dat morele recht.
5. Garantie en vrijwaring.
TENZIJ ANDERS SCHRIFTELIJK IS OVEREENGEKOMEN DOOR DE PARTIJEN, STELT DE LICENTIEGEVER HET WERK BESCHIKBAAR OP 'AS-IS' BASIS, ZONDER ENIGE GARANTIE, HETZIJ DIRECT, INDIRECT OF ANDERSZINS, MET BETREKKING TOT HET WERK, MET INBEGRIP VAN, MAAR NIET BEPERKT TOT GARANTIES MET BETREKKING TOT DE EIGENDOMSTITEL, DE VERKOOPBAARHEID, DE GESCHIKTHEID VOOR BEPAALDE DOELEINDEN, MOGELIJKE INBREUK, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN LATENTE OF ANDERE TEKORTKOMINGEN, DE JUISTHEID OF DE AAN- OF AFWEZIGHEID VAN FOUTEN, ONGEACHT DE OPSPOORBAARHEID DAARVAN, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT.
6. Beperking van de aansprakelijkheid.
DE LICENTIEGEVER AANVAARDT GEEN ENKELE AANSPRAKELIJKHEID JEGENS DE GEBRUIKER VOOR ENIGE BIJZONDERE OF INCIDENTELE SCHADE OF GEVOLGSCHADE VOORTVLOEIEND UIT DEZE LICENTIE OF HET GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK, ZELFS NIET INDIEN DE LICENTIEGEVER OP DE HOOGTE IS GESTELD VAN HET RISICO VAN DERGELIJKE SCHADE, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT.
7. Beëindiging
Deze Licentie en de daarin verleende rechten vervallen automatisch op het moment dat de Gebruiker in strijd handelt met de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. De licenties van natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die Verzamelwerken hebben ontvangen van de Gebruiker krachtens deze Licentie blijven echter in stand zolang dergelijke natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen zich houden aan de voorwaarden van die licenties. Na de beëindiging van deze Licentie blijven artikelen 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 en 8 onverminderd van kracht.
Met inachtneming van de hierboven vermelde voorwaarden wordt de Licentie verleend voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten op het Werk. De Licentiegever behoudt zich desalniettemin te allen tijde het recht voor om het Werk volgens gewijzigde licentievoorwaarden te verspreiden of om het Werk niet langer te verspreiden; met dien verstande dat een dergelijk besluit niet de intrekking van deze Licentie (of enig andere licentie die volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie (verplicht) is verleend) tot gevolg heeft, en deze Licentie onverminderd van kracht blijft tenzij zij op de in lid a omschreven wijze wordt beëindigd.
8. Diversen
Elke keer dat de Gebruiker het Werk of een Verzamelwerk verspreidt of on-line beschikbaar stelt, biedt de Licentiegever de ontvanger een licentie op het Werk aan volgens de algemene voorwaarden van deze Licentie.
Indien enige bepaling van deze Licentie nietig of niet rechtens afdwingbaar is, zullen de overige voorwaarden van deze Licentie volledig van kracht blijven. De nietige of niet-afdwingbare bepaling zal, zonder tussenkomst van de partijen, worden vervangen door een geldige en afdwingbare bepaling waarbij het doel en de strekking van de oorspronkelijke bepaling zoveel mogelijk in acht worden genomen.
Een verklaring van afstand van in deze Licentie verleende rechten of een wijziging van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dient schriftelijk te geschieden en getekend te zijn door de partij die verantwoordelijk is voor de verklaring van afstand respectievelijk de partij wiens toestemming voor de wijziging is vereist.
Deze Licentie bevat de volledige overeenkomst tussen de partijen met betrekking tot het in licentie gegeven Werk. Er zijn geen andere afspraken gemaakt met betrekking tot het Werk. De Licentiegever is niet gebonden aan enige aanvullende bepalingen die worden vermeld in mededelingen van de Gebruiker. Deze licentie kan uitsluitend worden gewijzigd met de wederzijdse, schriftelijke instemming van de Licentiegever en de Gebruiker.
Aansprakelijkheid en merkrechten van Creative Commons
Creative Commons is geen partij bij deze Licentie en stelt geen enkele garantie met betrekking tot het Werk. Creative Commons kan op geen enkele wijze aansprakelijk worden gehouden jegens de Gebruiker of derden voor enigerlei schade met inbegrip van, maar niet beperkt tot enige algemene, bijzondere, incidentele of gevolgschade voortvloeiend uit deze Licentie. Onverminderd het bepaalde in de twee (2) voorgaande volzinnen is Creative Commons gebonden aan alle rechten en verplichtingen van de Licentiegever indien Creative Commons zichzelf uitdrukkelijk kenbaar gemaakt heeft als de Licentiegever krachtens deze Licentie.
Met uitzondering van het beperkte doel om iedereen erop te wijzen dat het Werk in licentie is gegeven krachtens de CCPL, geeft Creative Commons aan geen van de partijen toestemming om gebruik te maken van de merknaam 'Creative Commons', enige daarmee verband houdende merknamen dan wel het logo van Creative Commons gebruiken zonder de voorafgaande schriftelijke toestemming van Creative Commons. Het geoorloofde gebruik dient in overeenstemming te zijn met de alsdan geldende richtlijnen betreffende het gebruik van merknamen van Creative Commons zoals die bekend worden gemaakt op de website of anderszins van tijd tot tijd, desgevraagd, ter beschikking worden gesteld. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat deze merkrechtelijke beperking geen deel uitmaakt van de Licentie.

2. Limitações e exceções ao direito de autor e/ou direitos conexos e outras utilizações livres. Nada nesta Licença deve ser interpretado de modo a reduzir, limitar ou restringir qualquer uso permitido de trabalhos protegidos por direito de autor ou por direitos conexos ou quaisquer direitos decorrentes de limitações e exceções estabelecidas em conexão com a proteção de direito de autor ou de direitos conexos, nos termos da Legislação Aplicável.
3. Concessão da Licença. O Licenciante concede ao Utilizador uma licença de âmbito mundial, gratuita, não exclusiva, pelo período de duração do direito de autor ou direito conexo aplicável, sujeita aos termos e condições da presente LPCC, para o exercício dos seguintes direitos de exploração:
Reproduzir o Trabalho, incorporar o Trabalho numa ou mais Coleções, Reproduzir o Trabalho quando incorporado em Coleções; e,
Distribuir e Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho, incluindo quando incorporado em Coleções.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se o seguinte:
Representação institucional obrigatória irrenunciável. Quando o direito de cobrar uma compensação monetária ou remuneração equitativa esteja sujeito a representação institucional obrigatória e seja, ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, irrenunciável, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito exclusivo de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração por qualquer exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença; e
Representação institucional obrigatória renunciável. Quando o direito de cobrar uma compensação monetária ou remuneração equitativa esteja sujeito a representação institucional obrigatória e seja, ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, renunciável, o Licenciante renuncia ao direito exclusivo de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração por qualquer exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença; e
Representação voluntária. Quando o direito de cobrar uma compensação monetária ou remuneração equitativa esteja sujeito a representação voluntária, o Licenciante renuncia ao direito de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração, quer individualmente quer – na hipótese de o Licenciante ser membro de uma sociedade de gestão coletiva de direitos (por exemplo, SPA, GDA, AUDIOGEST) – por intermédio dessa sociedade, por qualquer exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença.
Os direitos acima referidos podem ser exercidos em todos os meios e formatos, tangíveis ou intangíveis, independente de serem conhecidos agora ou concebidos posteriormente. Os direitos acima referidos incluem o direito de fazer as modificações que forem tecnicamente necessárias para exercer os direitos noutros meios e formatos, mas não o direito de transformar o Trabalho para criar Trabalhos Derivados. Todos os direitos que não tenham sido expressamente concedidos pelo Licenciante ficam assim reservados, incluindo, nomeadamente, os direitos estabelecidos na Secção 4(d). Caso o Licenciante seja titular dos direitos exclusivos previstos no Capítulo III do Decreto-Lei n.º 122/2000 de 4 de Julho, que implementou para a ordem jurídica portuguesa a Diretiva n.º 96/9/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 11 de Março, relativa à proteção jurídica de bases de dados, declara expressamente renunciar a esses direitos.
4. Restrições. A licença concedida na Secção 3 supra está expressamente sujeita e limitada pelas seguintes restrições:
O Utilizador apenas pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho sob os termos desta Licença. O Utilizador deve incluir, em cada cópia do Trabalho que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, uma cópia desta Licença ou o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI). O Utilizador não pode propor ou impor quaisquer termos que alterem ou restrinjam os termos desta Licença ou o exercício, por parte do destinatário, dos direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. O Utilizador não pode sub-licenciar o Trabalho. O Utilizador deve manter intactas, em cada cópia do Trabalho que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, todos os avisos que se referem a esta Licença e à exclusão de garantias. O Utilizador não pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público nenhuma cópia do Trabalho com qualquer medida tecnológica que restrinja a possibilidade do destinatário exercer os direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. Esta Secção 4(a) aplica-se ao Trabalho quando incorporado em Coleções, mas isto não requer que a Coleção, independente do próprio Trabalho, esteja sujeita aos termos desta Licença. Se o Utilizador criar uma Coleção e for notificado pelo Licenciante para remover da Coleção qualquer crédito inserido em conformidade com o estipulado na Secção 4(b), deve, na medida do razoável, agir de acordo com o solicitado.
Se o Utilizador Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho ou qualquer Coleção, deve – a menos que o Licenciante o tenha notificado em sentido contrário nos termos da Secção 4(a) parte final – manter intactos todos os avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, e exibir, de forma razoável em relação ao meio ou meios por si empregues: (i) o nome ou o pseudónimo, se fornecidos, do Titular Originário, nos avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, nos termos de serviço ou através de outros meios razoáveis; e/ou (ii) o nome da parte ou partes (por exemplo, um instituto, uma editora, uma revista) que o Titular Originário e/ou o Licenciante tiverem designado para atribuição (“Partes de Atribuição”), nos avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, nos termos de serviço ou através de outros meios razoáveis; e (iii) o título do Trabalho, se fornecido; e (iv) o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante tenha especificado para estar associado ao Trabalho, se o houver, exceto se o URI não disser respeito ao aviso referente ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento do Trabalho. Os créditos exigidos por esta Secção 4(b) podem ser implementados de qualquer forma, desde que razoável. No caso de uma Coleção, exibindo-se os créditos de todos os autores participantes da Coleção, os créditos ora exigidos devem fazer parte daqueles e devem aparecer de modo pelo menos tão proeminente quanto os créditos dados aos demais autores participantes. De modo a evitar dúvidas, o Utilizador apenas poderá fazer uso dos créditos exigidos por esta Secção 4(b) para o propósito de atribuição na forma estabelecida acima. Ao exercer os seus direitos sob esta Licença, o Utilizador não poderá implícita ou explicitamente afirmar ou sugerir qualquer vínculo, patrocínio ou apoio do Titular Originário, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição a si ou ao seu uso do Trabalho, a menos que tenha obtido prévia e expressamente autorização daqueles.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se que as restrições acima mencionadas [4(a) e 4(b)] não se aplicam àquelas partes do Trabalho que apenas sejam protegidas pelo direito especial do fabricante de base de dados previsto no art. 12.º do Decreto-Lei n.º 122/2000 de 4 de Julho, que implementou para a ordem jurídica portuguesa a Diretiva n.º 96/9/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 11 de Março, relativa à proteção jurídica de bases de dados.
Nada nesta Licença poderá afetar quaisquer dos direitos morais assegurados ao Autor ou ao Artista pela Legislação Aplicável, incluindo, sem limitação, o direito de oposição a toda e qualquer mutilação, deformação ou outra modificação do Trabalho e, de um modo geral, a todo e qualquer ato que a desvirtue e possa afetar a honra e reputação do Autor ou do Artista.
5. Declarações, Garantias e Exoneração
EXCETO QUANDO EXPRESSAMENTE ACORDADO PELAS PARTES POR ESCRITO EM SENTIDO CONTRÁRIO E NA MEDIDA PERMITIDA PELA LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL, O LICENCIANTE DISPONIBILIZA O TRABALHO “NO ESTADO EM QUE SE ENCONTRA” (“AS-IS BASIS”), E NÃO FAZ QUAISQUER DECLARAÇÕES OU PRESTA GARANTIAS DE QUALQUER TIPO EM RELAÇÃO AO TRABALHO, SEJAM EXPRESSAS OU IMPLÍCITAS, LEGAIS OU OUTRAS, INCLUINDO, SEM LIMITAÇÃO, QUAISQUER GARANTIAS SOBRE A TITULARIDADE DO TRABALHO, POTENCIALIDADE COMERCIAL, ADEQUAÇÃO A UM FIM ESPECÍFICO, LEGALIDADE, AUSÊNCIA DE DEFEITOS LATENTES OU OUTROS, EXATIDÃO, EXISTÊNCIA OU AUSÊNCIA DE ERROS, SEJAM ELES APARENTES OU OCULTOS. ALGUMAS JURISDIÇÕES NÃO ADMITEM A EXCLUSÃO DE GARANTIAS IMPLÍCITAS, PELO QUE TAL EXCLUSÃO PODERÁ NÃO SER APLICÁVEL AO UTILIZADOR.
6. Limitação de Responsabilidade. EXCETO NA EXTENSÃO EXIGIDA PELA LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL, EM NENHUMA CIRCUNSTÂNCIA O LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PARA COM O UTILIZADOR, COM BASE EM NENHUMA TEORIA JURÍDICA, POR QUAISQUER DANOS, GERAIS OU ESPECIAIS (INCLUINDO DANOS EMERGENTES E LUCROS CESSANTES), INCIDENTAIS OU CONSEQUENCIAIS, PUNITIVOS OU EXEMPLARES, QUE RESULTEM DA PRESENTE LICENÇA OU DA UTILIZAÇÃO DO TRABALHO, AINDA QUE O LICENCIANTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO SOBRE A POSSIBILIDADE DE OCORRÊNCIA DE TAIS DANOS.
7. Cessação
A presente Licença e os direitos concedidos pela mesma cessarão automaticamente em caso de qualquer violação dos termos desta Licença pelo Utilizador. Os indivíduos ou entidades que tenham recebido do Utilizador Coleções sob esta Licença, não terão, no entanto, as suas licenças cessadas, se permanecerem em total cumprimento com os termos dessas licenças. As Secções 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 subsistirão a qualquer cessação desta Licença.
Sujeita aos termos e condições acima expostos, a presente Licença é válida pelo período de duração do direito de autor ou do direito conexo aplicável ao Trabalho previsto na Legislação Aplicável. Sem prejuízo do disposto na frase anterior, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito de divulgar ou publicar o Trabalho sob termos e condições de licenciamento diferentes dos da presente Licença, ou de deixar, a qualquer momento, de Distribuir o Trabalho; desde que, no entanto, quaisquer dessas ações não sirva como meio de fazer cessar esta Licença (ou qualquer outra licença que tenha sido ou que deva ser concedida sob os termos desta Licença), a qual continuará plenamente válida e eficaz, a não ser que seja terminada de acordo com o acima disposto.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se que nada no disposto nas Secções 7(a) 7(b) poderá afetar o direito moral de retirada de circulação da obra literária ou artística assegurado ao Autor pela Legislação Aplicável, o qual só poderá, no entanto, ser exercido sob os termos e condições previstos nessa Legislação.
8. Outras Disposições
Cada vez que o Utilizador distribua ou apresente ao público o Trabalho, ou uma Coleção, o Licenciante concederá ao destinatário uma licença de utilização do Trabalho objeto desta Licença com os mesmos termos e condições que foram concedidos ao Utilizador sob a presente Licença.
Caso alguma disposição desta Licença seja tida como inválida ou não executória ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, tal não afetará a validade ou a possibilidade de execução dos restantes termos desta Licença e, sem necessidade de qualquer ação adicional das partes deste acordo, tal disposição será alterada na medida necessária para que se torne válida e executável.
Nenhum termo ou disposição desta Licença será considerado renunciado e nenhuma violação será considerada consentida, a não ser que tal renúncia ou consentimento seja feito por escrito e assinado pela parte que seja afetada por tal renúncia ou consentimento.
Esta Licença representa o acordo integral entre as partes relativamente ao Trabalho objeto desta Licença. Não existem entendimentos, acordos ou declarações relativos ao Trabalho que não estejam aqui especificados. O Licenciante não será obrigado por nenhuma disposição adicional que possa resultar de qualquer comunicação proveniente do Utilizador. Esta Licença não pode ser modificada sem o mútuo acordo, por escrito, entre o Licenciante e o Utilizador.

Não obstante o disposto nas duas (2) frases anteriores, se a Creative Commons se tiver expressamente identificado nesta Licença como Licenciante, deverá ter todos os direitos e obrigações do Licenciante.

Creative Commons Cod Juridic 
Atribuire–Fără Modificări 3.0 România
 
Organizaţia Creative Commons (denumită în continuare „Creative Commons”) nu este o firmă de avocatură şi nu acordă servicii de asistenţă juridică. Distribuirea acestei licenţe nu creează o relaţie de tip Avocat-Client. Creative Commons oferă această formă de licenţă, aşa cum este aceasta prezentată în cele ce urmează. Creative Commons nu îşi asumă răspunderea pentru daunele rezultate din conţinutul sau utilizarea acestei licenţe.
Licenţa
Opera (aşa cum este definită mai jos) este furnizată în condiţiile acestei Licenţe Publice Creative Commons (denumită în continuare „LPCC” sau „licenţă”). Opera este protejată de legea privind drepturile de autor şi drepturile conexe şi de celelalte norme de drept aplicabile. Orice utilizare a Operei în afara celei autorizate prin această licenţă sau prin legislaţia în vigoare este interzisă.
Exercitarea oricăror drepturi prevăzute de prezenta licenţă asupra Operei presupune acceptarea licenţei. Conform termenilor şi obligaţiilor din prezenta licenţă, în măsura în care prezenta licenţă poate fi considerată un contract, Licenţiatorul propune Licenţiatului exercitarea drepturilor menţionate mai jos, iar Licenţiatul este de acord cu termenii şi condiţiile licenţei.
1. Definiţii
"Opera" desemnează opera originală de creaţie intelectuală susceptibilă de protecţie prin dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe, furnizată în condiţiile prezenţei licenţe. În cadrul acestei licenţe, prin Operă se înţelege şi o fonogramă (culegere de opere fixate pe fonogramă), o videogramă (culegere de opere fixate pe o videogramă), un program de radiodifuziune ori de televiziune, precum şi o bază de date în conformitate cu definiţiile din legislaţia în vigoare privind drepturile de autor şi drepturile conexe, cu condiţia ca o asemenea fonogramă, videogramă, program de radiodifuziune ori de televiziune sau bază de date să fie protejate de legea aplicabilă.
"Adaptare" desemnează o Operă creată pe baza unei alte Opere sau pe baza unei Opere şi a unor alte Opere preexistente, aşa cum sunt traducerile, adaptările, operele derivate, aranjamentele muzicale sau alte alterări ale unor opere literare sau artistice sau ale unor fonograme sau comunicări publice, incluzând adaptările cinematografice sau orice alte adaptări prin care Opera poate fi modificată, transformată sau adaptată, incluzând, în orice formă, părţi uşor de recunoscut ale originalului. Fac excepţie Colecţiile, care nu vor fi considerate Adaptări potrivit scopului prezentei licenţe. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, atunci când Opera este o creaţie muzicală, interpretare muzicală sau fonogramă, sincronizarea acesteia în relaţie temporală cu o imagine aflată în mişcare ("sincronizare") va fi considerată Adaptare potrivit prezentei licenţe.
"Colecţie" desemnează un cumul de Opere literare sau artistice, aşa cum sunt enciclopediile şi antologiile, precum şi orice alte Opere sau subiecte, altele decât Operele enumerate la articolul 1 litera (a). Acestea, prin selecţia şi aranjamentul conţinutului lor, constituie creaţii intelectuale în care o Operă este inclusă în integralitatea ei în noua Operă, alături de una sau mai multe contribuţii, fiecare reprezentând Opere separate şi independente, care împreună dobândesc o formă colectivă. În sensul acestui contract, o Operă care constituie o Colecţie nu va fi considerată Adaptare.
"Autorul" desemnează, în cazul unei Opere literare sau artistice, persoana sau persoanele fizice care au creat Opera.
"Titularul de drepturi conexe" desemnează persoana fizică sau juridică, titular de drepturi conexe dreptului de autor, care poate fi: (i) artisti interpret sau executant, în cazul execuţiei sau interpretării; (ii) producător de înregistrări sonore şi de înregistrări audiovizuale, în cazul unei fonograme sau respectiv videograme; sau (iii) organism de radiodifuziune şi televiziune, în cazul programelor de radiodifuziune şi televiziune. În cadrul acestei licenţe, prin titular de drepturi conexe se va înţelege şi fabricantul unei baze de date.
"Licenţiatorul" desemnează persoana sau persoanele fizice şi/sau juridice care pun la dispoziţie Opera, în condiţiile prezentei licenţe.
"Licenţiatul" desemnează persoana fizică şi/sau persoana juridică care acceptă prezenta licenţă şi exercită drepturile acordate, fără să fi încălcat în prealabil termenii licenţei, sau care a primit permisiunea expresă a Licenţiatorului de a exercita drepturile conferite prin prezenta licenţă, în pofida unei încălcări anterioare a prevederilor acesteia.
"Comunicare publică" desemnează orice comunicare a unei Opere, realizată direct sau prin orice mijloace tehnice, făcută într-un loc accesibil publicului sau în orice loc în care se adună un număr de persoane care depăşeşte cercul normal al membrilor unei familii şi al cunoştinţelor acesteia, inclusiv reprezentarea scenică, recitarea sau orice altă modalitate publică de execuţie ori de prezentare directă a Operei, expunerea publică a Operelor de artă plastică, de artă aplicată, fotografică şi de arhitectură, proiecţia publică a Operelor cinematografice şi a altor Opere audiovizuale, inclusiv a Operelor de artă digitală, prezentarea într-un loc public, prin intermediul înregistrărilor sonore sau audiovizuale, precum şi prezentarea într-un loc public, prin intermediul oricăror mijloace, a unei Opere radiodifuzate. De asemenea, se consideră publică orice comunicare a unei Opere, prin mijloace cu fir sau fără fir, realizată prin punerea la dispoziţia publicului, inclusiv prin Internet sau alte reţele de calculatoare, astfel încât oricare dintre membrii publicului să poată avea acces la aceasta din orice loc sau în orice moment ales în mod individual.
"Distribuire" desemnează orice mod de transmitere a originalului sau a copiilor unei Opere sau Adaptări, precum şi oferirea publică a acestora.
"Reproducere" desemnează realizarea, integrală sau parţială, a uneia ori a mai multor copii ale unei Opere, direct sau indirect, temporar ori permanent, prin orice mijloc şi sub orice formă, inclusiv realizarea oricărei înregistrări sonore sau audiovizuale a unei Opere, precum şi stocarea permanentă ori temporară a acesteia prin mijloace electronice.
"Opţiunile licenţei" desemnează următoarele atribute importante ale licenţei, aşa cum au fost acestea selectate de către Licenţiator şi cum sunt indicate în titlul prezentei licenţe: Atribuire–Fără Modificări.
2. Limitele exercitării dreptului de autor. Nicio prevedere a acestei licenţe nu are scopul de a reduce, de a limita sau de a restrânge drepturile rezultate din aplicarea normelor legale cu privire la limitele exercitării dreptului de autor prevăzute de legislaţia privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe sau de alte legi aplicabile.
3. Autorizare. În condiţiile definite prin prezenta licenţă şi pe întreaga durată de protecţie a Operei prevăzută de legislaţia privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe, Licenţiatorul acordă Licenţiatului în mod neexclusiv, nelimitat teritorial şi cu titlu gratuit autorizarea de a exercita următoarele drepturi:
dreptul de a reproduce Opera, de a o încorpora într-una sau mai multe Colecţii şi de a reproduce Opera aşa cum a fost aceastaîncorporată într-o Colecţie;
dreptul de a distribui şi comunica public Opera, inclusiv încorporată în Colecţii;
în cazul în care opera este o bază de date, dreptul de a extrage şi/sau a reutiliza părţi substanţiale din Operă.
Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, trebuie să notam:  
Regim legal obligatoriu de gestiune colectivă. În cazul în care un tip de utilizare a Operei ar fi supus unui regim legal obligatoriu de gestiune colectivă (de ex. dreptul la remuneraţie compensatorie pentru copia privată), Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul exclusiv de a colecta remuneraţiile respective prin intermediul organismului de gestiune colectivă competent, atât în cazul utilizării comerciale, cât şi în cazul utilizării necomerciale a Operei;
Regim legal facultativ de gestiune colectivă. În cazul în care un tip de utilizare a Operei ar fi supus unui regim legal facultativ de gestiune colectivă (de ex. dreptul de împrumut), Licenţiatorul renunţă la dreptul de a colecta aceste remuneraţii pentru orice exercitare de către Licenţiat a drepturilor obţinute prin prezenta licenţă;
Gestiunea colectivă a drepturilor. Licenţiatorul renunţă, acolo unde legea permite, la dreptul de a colecta remuneraţiile (independent sau, când Licenţiatorul este un membru al unui organism de gestiune colectivă, prin acesta) pentru orice exercitare de către Licenţiat a drepturilor obţinute prin prezenta licenţă.
Drepturile menţionate mai sus pot fi exercitate în cazul tuturor mediilor de stocare şi formatelor cunoscute. Drepturile menţionate mai sus includ şi dreptul de a face modificările tehnice corespunzătoare necesare exercitării acestora în cazul altor medii de stocare sau formate. Toate drepturile care nu sunt expres acordate de Licenţiator sau asupra cărora Licenţiatorul nu are dreptul de gestiune rămân rezervate, în special în cazurile de gestiune colectivă obligatorie aplicabile menţionate la articolul 3 litera (d). Daca Licenţiatorul este titularul drepturilor sui-generis asupra unei baze de date, în conformitate cu legea naţională care implementează Directiva Europeană privind Bazele de Date, Licenţiatorul va renunţa la aceste drepturi.
4. Restricţii. Licenţa, acordată în conformitate cu articolul 3, se încheie sub condiţia respectării următoarelor restricţii:
Licenţiatul poate distribui sau comunica public Opera numai în condiţiile prezentei licenţe. Licenţiatul este obligat să includă o copie a licenţei sau adresa acesteia pe Internet (U.R.I. - Uniform Resource Identifier) împreună cu fiecare copie a Operei care este distribuită sau comunicată public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a oferi sau impune nicio condiţie asupra Operei, care să modifice sau să restricţioneze prevederile acestei licenţe sau exercitarea drepturilor terţilor dobânditori, aşa cum sunt acestea prevăzute în prezenta licenţă. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a sublicenţia Opera. Licenţiatul este obligat să păstreze intacte toate notificările care se referă la prezenta licenţă şi la exonerarea de răspundere din fiecare copie a Operei pe care o distribuie sau comunică public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a distribui sau de a comunica public Opera folosind măsuri tehnice de protecţie care restrâng posibilitatea terţilor dobânditori de a-şi exercita drepturile obţinute în condiţiile prezentei licenţe. Prezenta literă (a) se aplică Operei încorporate într-o Colecţie, dar nu se extinde în mod obligatoriu asupra celorlalte Opere conţinute în Colecţie. Dacă Licenţiatul creează o Colecţie, acesta este obligat, la notificarea oricărui Licenţiator, în măsura în care este posibil, să înlăture din Colecţie orice referinţă la respectivul Licenţiator, la Titularul de drepturi conexe sau la Autorul Operei, astfel cum se specifică la articolul 4 litera (b).
În cazul în care Licenţiatul distribuie sau comunică public Opera sau Colecţiile, Licenţiatul este obligat, cu excepţia cererilor făcute în baza articolului 4 litera (a), să păstreze intacte toate informaţiile sau notificările privind drepturile de autor sau conexe asupra Operei şi să furnizeze următoarele informaţii, în funcţie de mediul sau mijloacele utilizate: (i) numele Autorului şi/sau al Titularului de drepturi conexe (sau pseudonimul, după caz), dacă acesta a fost adus la cunoştinţă, şi/sau numele părţii desemnate de Autor, Titular de Drepturi Conexe şi/sau de Licenţiator pentru atribuirea Operei, în notificările Licenţiatorului privind drepturile de autor, condiţiile de utilizare sau alte menţiuni disponibile; (ii) titlul Operei, dacă este furnizat; şi (iii) în măsura în care este posibil şi dacă există, adresa pe Internet (U.R.I.) pe care Licenţiatorul o desemnează pentru a fi asociată cu Opera, cu excepţia cazului în care această adresă nu se referă la informaţiile privind paternitatea Operei şi condiţiile de utilizare a Operei. Menţiunea cerută la prezenta literă (c) poate fi introdusă în orice modalitate adecvată; cu toate acestea, în cazul unei Colecţii, dacă apar menţiuni similare pentru toţi Autorii care contribuie la Colecţie, cel puţin o astfel de menţiune este necesar a fi introdusă alături de celelalte menţiuni şi în aceeaşi măsură ca pentru ceilalţi Autori. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, Licenţiatul poate folosi menţiunea cerută în această secţiune doar în scopul atribuirii în modalitatea prevăzută anterior, iar în scopul exercitării drepturilor în condiţiile prezentei licenţe, Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a susţine sau a sugera, direct sau indirect, orice legătură, finanţare sau susţinere din partea Autorului, Titularului de Drepturi Conexe, Licenţiatorului şi/sau părţii desemnate de aceştia pentru atribuire, după caz, pentru Licenţiat sau utilizarea Operei de către Licenţiat, cu excepţia permisiunilor separate, exprese, acordate în scris şi anterior de către Autor, Titularul de drepturi conexe, Licenţiator şi/sau partea desemnată de aceştia pentru atribuire.
Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri: Restricţiile menţionate la litera (a) şi (b) nu se aplică acelor Opere care îndeplinesc doar criteriul dreptului sui generis asupra unei baze de date în conformitate cu legea română privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe.
Drepturile morale rămân nemodificate, în măsura în care sunt recunoscute şi nu pot face obliectul unor renunţări în conformitate cu legea aplicabilă.
5. Garanţie şi exonerarea de răspundere 
Prin punerea Operei la dispoziţia publicului în conformitate cu dispoziţiile prezentei licenţe, Licenţiatorul declară de bună credinţă că, în conformitate cu ceea ce cunoaşte şi în limite rezonabile:  
Licenţiatorul a obţinut toate drepturile necesare asupra Operei pentru a putea autoriza exerciţiul drepturilor acordate prin prezenta licenţă şi a permite utilizarea netulburată şi exerciţiul licit al acestor drepturi, aceasta fără ca Licenţiatul să aibă o obligaţie de a plăti vreo remuneraţie, cu excepţia celor prevăzute de mecanismele de gestiune colectivă obligatorie descrise la articolul 3 litera (d);
Opera nu dă naştere vreunei încălcări a drepturilor unor terţe persoane, în special drepturi de autor sau drepturi conexe, drepturi privind mărcile, drepturi privind informaţia, drepturi patrimoniale sau oricare alte drepturi, şi nici vreunei defăimări, violări a dreptului la viaţa privată sau vreunui alt fapt ilicit cu privire la oricare altă terţă parte.
Cu excepţia cazurilor prevăzute expres în prezenta licenţă sau într-un alt acord scris, sau cerute de legea aplicabilă, Opera este pusă la dispoziţie fără vreo garanţie de orice fel, expresă sau tacită, inclusiv în ceea ce priveşte conţinutul Operei sau exactitatea acesteia.
6. Limitarea răspunderii. Cu excepţia răspunderii cerută de normele imperative ale legii aplicabile şi a reparării prejudiciilor impuse de răspunderea faţă de terţi generată de încălcarea garanţiilor prevăzute la articolul 5, Licenţiatorul nu va fi responsabil faţa de Licenţiat, în temeiul niciunei doctrine juridice, pentru orice prejudicii directe, indirecte, materiale sau morale care decurg din această licenţă sau din utilizarea Operei, chiar dacă Licenţiatorul a fost avertizat asupra posibilităţii producerii unor asemenea prejudicii.
7. Rezilierea licenţei
Această licenţă este reziliată de plin drept, iar drepturile acordate prin intermediul său vor înceta în mod implicit în cazul în care Licenţiatul săvârşeşte orice fel de încălcare a condiţiilor licenţei. Licenţele prin care persoane fizice sau persoane juridice au dobândit de la Licenţiat Adaptări sau Colecţii, în condiţiile acestei licenţe, nu vor fi reziliate, atât timp cât respectivii dobânditori vor respecta condiţiile sub care le-au fost acordate drepturile respective. Articolele 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 şi 8 rămân aplicabile chiar după rezilierea prezentei licenţe.
În limitele indicate mai sus, prezenta licenţă se aplică pe întreaga durată de protecţie a Operei conform legii aplicabile. Cu toate acestea, Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul de a exploata Opera şi în alte condiţii contractuale sau de a înceta oricând distribuirea Operei; totuşi, utilizarea acestei opţiuni a Licenţiatorului nu va conduce la restrângerea efectelor prezentei licenţe (sau a oricărei alte licenţe care a fost sau trebuie să fie acordată conform condiţiilor prezentei licenţe), iar licenţa va continua să producă efecte depline, până la rezilierea sa în baza prevederilor menţionate mai sus.
8. Alte prevederi
Cu fiecare reproducere sau comunicare publică în format digital de către Licenţiat a Operei sau a unei Colecţii, Licenţiatorul face primitorului o ofertă de licenţă având ca obiect Opera, conţinând aceleaşi condiţii ca şi prezenta licenţă încheiată cu Licenţiatul.
Dacă o prevedere a prezentei licenţe este nulă sau inaplicabilă conform legislaţiei în vigoare, validitatea sau aplicabilitatea celorlalte dispoziţii ale licenţei nu va fi afectată. Fără a fi necesare alte acţiuni ale părţilor la prezenta licenţă, prevederile nule sau inaplicabile vor fi interpretate în măsura minimă necesară pentru a deveni valide şi aplicabile.
Nu se va considera că s-a renunţat la vreo prevedere a prezentei licenţe sau la invocarea încălcării acesteia, cu excepţia cazului în care o astfel de renunţare este în scris şi semnată de partea care suportă consecinţele renunţării sau invocării încălcării.
Prezenta licenţă constituie convenţia părţilor în întregul său asupra Operei astfel licenţiate. Nu există alte înţelegeri, acorduri sau dispoziţii privind Opera care să nu fie specificate prin prezenta licenţă. Licenţiatorul nu va fi subiect al niciunei dispoziţii suplimentare comunicate de către Licenţiat. Prezenta licenţă nu poate fi modificată fără acordul mutual scris al Licenţiatorului şi al Licenţiatului.
Dreptul aplicabil este dreptul român.
Notă privind Creative Commons
Creative Commons nu este parte a prezentei licenţe şi nu acordă nicio garanţie legată de Operă. Creative Commons nu este răspunzătoare faţă de Licenţiat sau faţă de orice altă persoană, în conformitate cu nicio doctrină juridică, pentru niciun fel de prejudicii, inclusiv, cu titlu exemplificativ, pentru orice prejudicii directe, indirecte, materiale sau morale produse în legătură cu prezenta licenţă. Prin excepţie de la cele două teze anterioare, dacă Creative Commons s-a identificat în mod expres ca fiind Licenţiator în accepţiunea prezentei licenţe, atunci va avea toate drepturile şi obligaţiile Licenţiatorului.
Cu excepţia scopului limitat de a indica publicului că Opera este licenţiată conform LPCC (Licenţa Publică Creative Commons), Creative Commons nu autorizează utilizarea de către niciuna dintre părţi a mărcii „Creative Commons” sau a oricărei alte mărci sau însemne ale Creative Commons fără consimţământul prealabil exprimat în scris al Creative Commons. Orice utilizare autorizată va fi în concordanţă cu specificaţiile corespunzătoare privind utilizarea mărcii, aşa cum vor fi publicate pe site-ul oficial al Creative Commons sau aşa cum vor fi puse la dispoziţie, periodic, la cerere. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, limitarea dreptului de a folosi marca Creative Commons nu face parte din prezenţa licenţă.

El Licenciatario puede Distribuir o Comunicar Públicamente la Obra sólo bajo los términos de esta Licencia. El Licenciatario debe incluir el Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI), o una copia de la Licencia, con cada copia de la Obra que Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente.

El Licenciatario no puede sublicenciar la Obra. El Licenciatario debe mantener intactos todos los anuncios que se refieran a esta Licencia y a la ausencia de garantías en cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente.

Esta Sección 4 (a) se aplica a la Obra incorporada en una Colección, pero esto no exige que la Colección, aparte de la Obra misma, quede sujeta a los términos de esta Licencia. Si el Licenciatario crea una Colección, previo aviso de cualquier Licenciante, deberá, en la medida de lo posible, quitar de la Colección cualquier crédito requerido en la Sección 4 (b), conforme a lo solicitado.
Si el Licenciatario Distribuye o Comunica Públicamente la Obra o las Colecciones, el Licenciatario debe, a menos que se haya presentado una solicitud de conformidad con la Sección 4 (a), mantener intactos todos los avisos de derechos de autor de la Obra y proporcionar, de forma razonable con el medio o los medios que el Licenciatario está utilizando: (i) el nombre del Autor Original (o seudónimo, en su caso), y/o si el autor o Licenciante ofrece, el nombre de las partes (por ejemplo, organización de hospedaje, de publicación, editorial, revista) para designar la atribución ("Partes Reconocidas") como se reconoce en el presente aviso legal, términos de uso o cualquier otra manera razonable; (ii) el título de la Obra si fue suministrado; (iii) en la medida de lo razonablemente posible, la URI, si existiese, que el Licenciante haya especificado como asociada a la obra, salvo que tal URI no se refiera al aviso de derechos de autor o a la información sobre la Licencia de la Obra. El crédito requerido por esta Sección 4 (b) puede ser implementado de cualquier forma razonable, prevista, sin embargo, que en el caso de una Colección, tal crédito debe aparecer, como mínimo, como parte de los créditos correspondientes a los demás autores que contribuyeron, y de una manera igual de destacada. Para evitar dudas, el Licenciatario sólo podrá utilizar el crédito requerido por esta Sección 4 (b) con el propósito de la atribución en la manera anteriormente descrita y, al ejercer los derechos otorgados bajo esta Licencia, el Licenciatario no podrá implícita o explícitamente afirmar o implicar ninguna conexión, patrocinio o respaldo por parte del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Partes Reconocidas, según corresponda, del uso de la Obra, sin el permiso independiente, expreso, previo y por escrito del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Partes Reconocidas.

ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE PUEDE NO SER APLICABLE AL LICENCIATARIO.
6. Limitación de Responsabilidad. EL LICENCIANTE NO SERÁ RESPONSABLE FRENTE AL LICENCIATARIO POR DAÑO ALGUNO, SEA POR RESPONSABILIDAD EXTRACONTRACTUAL O CONTRACTUAL, OBJETIVA O SUBJETIVA, SE TRATE DE DAÑOS MORALES O PATRIMONIALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PREVISTOS O IMPREVISTOS, PRODUCIDOS POR EL USO DE ESTA LICENCIA O DE LA OBRA, AÚN CUANDO EL LICENCIANTE HAYA SIDO ADVERTIDO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE DICHOS DAÑOS, SALVO QUE ALGUNAS LEYES NO PERMITAN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE CIERTA RESPONSABILIDAD Y/Ó PREVEAN EXPRESAMENTE EL DERECHO DE INDEMNIZACIÓN A FAVOR DEL LICENCIATARIO, EN CUYO CASO ESTA EXCLUSIÓN NO SERÁ APLICABLE.
7. Terminación
La presente Licencia y los derechos aquí concedidos finalizarán automáticamente por el incumplimiento del Licenciatario de los términos de esta Licencia. Las personas o entidades que hayan recibido del Licenciatario las Colecciones bajo esta Licencia, sin embargo, no verán anuladas sus licencias siempre que tales personas o entidades se mantengan en pleno cumplimiento de aquellas licencias.

No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho de difundir la Obra bajo diferentes términos de licencia o a dejar de distribuirla en cualquier momento, con la salvedad de que tal elección no podrá revocar esta Licencia (ni ninguna otra licencia que haya sido o deba ser concedida bajo los términos de ésta) y que esta Licencia continuará en pleno vigor y efecto a menos que sea finalizada conforme a lo establecido anteriormente.
8. Varios
Cada vez que el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente la Obra o una Colección, el Licenciante ofrecerá al beneficiario una licencia para la Obra en los mismos términos y condiciones que la que aquí se otorga.
Si alguna disposición de esta Licencia es inválida o no exigible bajo la ley aplicable, esto no afectará la validez o aplicabilidad del resto de los términos de esta Licencia y, sin más acción de las partes de este acuerdo, tal disposición se entenderá reformada en la medida mínima necesaria para que sea válida y exigible.
Ninguna de las disposiciones de esta Licencia se considerará renunciable, ni se consentirá violación alguna de ellas, a menos que tal renuncia o consentimiento sea por escrito y firmado por las partes que serán afectadas por tal renuncia o consentimiento.
La presente Licencia constituye el acuerdo completo entre las partes respecto a la Obra aquí licenciada. No hay entendimientos, acuerdos o condiciones respecto a la Obra que no estén especificados aquí. El Licenciante no será obligado por ninguna disposición adicional que pueda aparecer en cualquier comunicación emanada por el Licenciatario. Esta Licencia no puede ser modificada sin el mutuo acuerdo por escrito del Licenciante y el Licenciatario.
Los derechos acá concedidos, y objeto de la materia referenciada, en la presente Licencia se elaboraron utilizando la terminología de la Ley sobre el Derecho de Autor de Venezuela promulgada el 14 de agosto de 1993, y el Reglamento de la Ley Sobre el Derecho de Autor de fecha 09 de septiembre de 1997, la Ley Orgánica del Trabajo, los Trabajadores y las Trabajadoras promulgada en fecha 8 de mayo de 2012 en lo concerniente al Derecho de Autor, la Ley Aprobatoria de Adhesión de Venezuela a la Convención de Berna para la Protección de las Obras Literarias y Artísticas (tal como fue promulgada el 12 de mayo de 1982), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de Roma de 1961 (promulgada 13 de septiembre de 1995), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de París (promulgada el 12 de septiembre de 1995), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de Ginebra (promulgada el 18 de noviembre de 1982), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de la OMPI (promulgada el 23 de noviembre 1984), la Ley Aprobatoria del Tratado de la OMPI (promulgada el 20 de diciembre de 1996), y la Ley Aprobatoria de la Convención Universal de Copyright (promulgada el 19 de octubre, 1995). Si el conjunto estándar de los derechos previstos en la legislación de derechos de autor incluye derechos adicionales no concedidos bajo esta Licencia, tales derechos adicionales se considerarán incluidos en la Licencia, esta Licencia no está destinada a restringir derechos licenciados bajo la ley aplicable.

Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
Section 1 – Definitions.
Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.
License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 – License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
Attribution.
If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted Material.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database, provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.
This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.

You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.

If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan).

Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.

Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous

A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

2. Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte
Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die sich aus den Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte, anderen Beschränkungen der Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers oder anderen entsprechenden Rechtsnormen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung

Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie geltend zu machen.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Soweit Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Geltendmachung der Vergütungsansprüche durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.

4. Bedingungen
Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dasselbe gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung vornehmen, müssen Sie – soweit dies praktikabel ist – auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Bearbeitung die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen.
Sie dürfen eine Bearbeitung ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen
dieser Lizenz,
einer späteren Version dieser Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen,
einer rechtsordnungsspezifischen Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts (z.B. Namensnennung - Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 US),
der Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts, oder
einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz
verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben.
Falls Sie die Bearbeitung gemäß Abschnitt b)(v) unter einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen Folge leisten.
Falls Sie die Bearbeitung unter einer der unter b)(i)-(iv) genannten Lizenzen ("Verwendbare Lizenzen") lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen sowie folgenden Bestimmungen Folge leisten: Sie müssen stets eine Kopie der verwendbaren Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen, wenn Sie die Bearbeitung verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen der verwendbaren Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Rechte beschränken. Bei jeder Bearbeitung, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise auf die verwendbare Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Wenn Sie die Bearbeitung verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf die Bearbeitung) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer der Bearbeitung in der Ausübung der ihm durch die verwendbare Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.b) gilt auch für den Fall, dass die Bearbeitung einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet; dies bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt der verwendbaren Lizenz unterstellt werden muss.
Die Verbreitung und die öffentliche Wiedergabe des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Inhalte oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Urheberschaft oder die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie selbst – soweit bekannt – Folgendes angeben:
Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers, und/oder falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) („Zuschreibungsempfänger“), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
den Titel des Inhaltes;
in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand;
und im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine Bearbeitung handelt.
Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung aller Beitragenden dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Urhebers, des Lizenzgebers und/oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder implizit noch explizit irgendeine Verbindung mit dem oder eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch den Lizenzgeber oder den Zuschreibungsempfänger andeuten oder erklären.
Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen.
(Urheber)Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt.
5. Gewährleistung
SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE ERTEILUNG DER NUTZUNGSBEWILLIGUNG UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN.

7. Erlöschen
Diese Lizenz und die durch sie erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke sowie entsprechende Vervielfältigungsstücke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort.
Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.
8. Sonstige Bestimmungen
Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat.
Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß 8.a) und b) angebotenen Lizenzen aus.
Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Republik Österreich Anwendung.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collection" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole. A Collection may, for example, include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purposes of this Licence.
"Creative Commons Compatible Licence" means a licence that is listed at https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this Licence, including, at a minimum, because that licence:
contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the Licence Elements of this Licence; and
explicitly permits the relicensing of derivatives of works made available under that licence under this Licence or a Creative Commons jurisdiction licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence.
"Derivative Work" means material in any form that is created by editing, modifying or adapting the Work, a substantial part of the Work, or the Work and other pre-existing works. Derivative Works may, for example, include a translation, adaptation, musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be transformed or adapted, except that a Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public by any means, including publication, electronic communication, or broadcast.
"Licence Elements" means the following high-level licence attributes indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution, ShareAlike.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this Licence.
"Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work.
"Reproduce" means to make a copy of the Work in any material form (eg storage in digital form).
"Work" means the material (including any work or other subject matter) protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. This may include (without limitation) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; a sound recording or cinematograph film; a published edition of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or a television or sound broadcast.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights
Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions under copyright law or any other applicable laws.
3. Licence Grant
3A Grant of Rights
Provided that the terms set out in this Licence are satisfied, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the following rights:
Reproduce the Work;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any Collection;
create and Reproduce one or more Derivative Works; and
Distribute and publicly perform the Work, a Derivative Work or the Work as incorporated in any Collection.
3B Media and Formats
The above rights may be exercised in any media or format whether now known or hereafter created. They include the right to make modifications that are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
3C Other Rights Reserved
All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
4. Restrictions
The licence granted above is limited by the following restrictions.
4A Restrictions on Distribution and Public Performance of the Work
You may Distribute and publicly perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
You are not granted the right to sublicense the Work. The rights of recipients of the Work from You are governed by clause 9.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, You must not impose any technological measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other material within the Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work itself, to be made subject to this Licence.
4B Restrictions on Distribution and Public Performance of Derivative Works
You may only Distribute or publicly perform a Derivative Work if You apply one of the following licences to it:
this Licence;
a later version of this Licence with the same Licence Elements (such as Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 Australia); or
a Creative Commons Unported licence or a licence from another jurisdiction (either this or a later version) that has the same Licence Elements (such as Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Netherlands); or
a Creative Commons Compatible Licence.
If You license the Derivative Work under a Creative Commons Compatible Licence You must comply with the terms of that licence.
If You license the Derivative Work under the terms of any of the licences mentioned in clause 4B(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable Licence") You must comply with the terms of that licence generally and the following provisions:
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) for, the Applicable Licence with every copy of the Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
You must not impose any terms on the Derivative Work that restrict the Applicable Licence, or the ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by that licence.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Derivative Work that You Distribute or publicly perform.
When You Distribute or publicly perform a Derivative Work You must not impose any technological measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by the Applicable Licence.
For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4B applies to any Derivative Work as incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other material within the Collection, or the Collection as a whole, to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable Licence.
4C Attribution and Notice Requirements
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Work or Collection You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Work or Collection You must provide, in a manner reasonable to the medium or means You are using:
the name or pseudonym (if provided) of the Original Author and/or of any other party (such as a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal) that the Original Author or Licensor has requested be attributed (such as in the copyright notice or terms of use). In this clause 4C these parties are referred to as "Attribution Parties";
the title of the Work (if provided); and
to the extent reasonably practicable, any Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) that the Licensor specifies should be associated with the Work that refers to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
For any Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly perform, You must take reasonable steps to clearly identify that changes were made to the Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish".
In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part of any credits for other contributing authors and be as prominent as the credits for those other authors.
You must, to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any Collection or Derivative Work if requested to do so by the Licensor or Original Author.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this clause 4C for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above. By exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must not assert or imply:
any connection between the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party and You or Your use of the Work; or
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party of You or Your use of the Work,
without their separate, express prior written permission.
4D Moral Rights
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4D, "moral rights" means the personal rights granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have authorship falsely attributed.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Work "as-is" and makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, any representations, warranties or conditions regarding:
the contents or accuracy of the Work;
title, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose;
non-infringement;
the absence of latent or other defects; or
the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, imply certain warranties and conditions in certain circumstances, such as the right to supply or fitness for purpose of goods or services supplied to a consumer. Clause 5(a) cannot and is not intended to exclude, restrict or modify these warranties.
6. Limit of Liability
To the full extent permitted by applicable law, and except for any liability arising from contrary agreement, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal basis (including without limitation, negligence) for any loss or damage whatsoever, including (without limitation):
loss of production or operation time, loss, damage or corruption of data or records; or
loss of anticipated savings, opportunity, revenue, profit or goodwill, or other economic loss; or
any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Licence or the use of the Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
If applicable legislation implies warranties or conditions, or imposes obligations or liability on the Licensor in respect of this Licence that cannot be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified, the Licensor’s liability is limited, to the full extent permitted by the applicable legislation, at its option, to:
in the case of goods, any one or more of the following:
the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
the repair of the goods;
the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;
the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
in the case of services:
the supplying of the services again; or
the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, restrict the limitation of liability in certain circumstances, such as a contract for the supply of goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic, or household use. Clauses 6(a) and 6(b) cannot and are not intended to apply in circumstances where it is prohibited by law.
7. Termination
This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals or entities who have received a Derivative Work or a Collection from You pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided they remain in full compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of this Licence.
8. Licensor’s Rights Retained
Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such release will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work from You
Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, a Derivative Work or a Collection the Licensor offers the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms as are granted to You under this Licence.
10. Severability
If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence. Without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
11. Waivers and Consents
No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the relevant party.
12. Entire Agreement
This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. To the full extent permitted by law, there are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may not be modified without the written agreement of the Licensor and You.
13. Governing Law
The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by the laws in force in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.

Lizenz
Durch die Ausübung eines durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechts an dem Lizenzgegenstand erklären Sie sich mit den Lizenzbedingungen rechtsverbindlich einverstanden. Soweit diese Lizenz als Vertrag anzusehen ist, gewährt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber die in der Lizenz genannten Rechte unentgeltlich und im Austausch dafür, dass Sie das Gebundensein an die Lizenzbedingungen akzeptieren.
Der „Lizenzgeber“, d.h. die Person, welche den Lizenzgegenstand unter dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung stellt,  und  „Sie“, d.h. die natürliche oder juristische Person, welche die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannten Nutzungen des Lizenzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand nicht gegen die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstossen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstosses auszuüben,  vereinbaren mit dieser Creative Commons Public License („CCPL“ oder „Lizenz“) die Nutzungsbedingungen für den Lizenzgegenstand,  im Einzelnen:
1. Definitionen
„Lizenzgegenstand“ kann ein urheberrechtlich geschütztes Werk sein oder eine durch verwandte Schutzrechte geschützte Leistung.
Eine „Sammlung“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist eine Zusammenstellung des Lizenzgegenstands mit anderen Werken oder sonstigen Elementen, unabhängig davon, ob an der Sammlung selbst aufgrund der Anordnung oder der Auswahl des Inhalts ein Urheberrecht entsteht. Als Sammlung gelten auch Datenbanken, unabhängig davon, ob an der Datenbank selbst aufgrund der Anordnung oder der Auswahl des Inhalts ein Urheberrecht entsteht. Die Aufnahme des Lizenzgegenstandes in eine Sammlung gilt nicht als Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes.
Eine „Abwandlung“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist jede Veränderung des Lizenzgegenstandes, insbesondere eine Umgestaltung, Bearbeitung, Änderung, Anpassung oder Übersetzung, solange der Lizenzgegenstand in seinem individuellen Charakter erkennbar bleibt. Nicht als Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes gilt seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung.
„Rechteinhaber“ ist der Urheber des Lizenzgegenstandes, der Inhaber verwandter Schutzrechte oder jede andere Person, die am Lizenzgegenstand Nutzungsrechte erlangt hat, welche die Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder die Weiterübertragung der Nutzungsrechte an Dritte erlauben.
Ein „Werk“ ist eine geistige Schöpfung mit individuellem Charakter.
Ein „verwandtes Schutzrecht“ ist ein Recht an einer kulturellen Leistung, welche nicht als Werk geschützt ist, wie etwa jene von ausübenden Künstlern, Herstellern von Ton- und Tonbildträgern oder Sendeunternehmen.
„Öffentlich Wiedergeben“ ist das Vortragen des Lizenzgegenstandes direkt oder mit irgendwelchen Mitteln, das Aufführen, das Vorführen, das anderswo Wahrnehmbarmachen oder das Zugänglichmachen in der Weise, dass Personen von Orten und zu Zeiten ihrer Wahl dazu Zugang haben.
„Vervielfältigen“ bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren vorübergehende oder dauerhafte Vervielfältigungsstücke des Lizenzgegenstandes herzustellen und umfasst auch den Vorgang der erstmaligen körperlichen Fixierungen des Lizenzgegenstandes und der Herstellung von Vervielfältigungen dieser Fixierungen sowie die Übertragung des Lizenzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleich ob in digitaler oder analoger Form.
„Verbreiten“ bedeutet, den Lizenzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
„Lizenzelemente“ sind die folgenden, vom Lizenzgeber ausgewählten und im Titel dieser Lizenz genannten Lizenzcharakteristika: „Namensnennung“, „Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen“.
„Mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz“ bezeichnet eine Lizenz, die unter https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses aufgelistet ist und die durch Creative Commons als grundsätzlich zur vorliegenden Lizenz äquivalent akzeptiert wurde, da zumindest folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt sind:  Diese mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz
enthält Bestimmungen, welche die gleichen Ziele verfolgen, die gleiche Bedeutung haben und die gleichen Wirkungen erzeugen wie die Lizenzelemente der vorliegenden Lizenz, und
erlaubt ausdrücklich das Lizenzieren von ihr unterstellten Abwandlungen unter vorliegender Lizenz, unter einer anderen rechtsordnungsspezifisch angepassten Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen, wie sie die vorliegende Lizenz aufweist, oder unter der entsprechenden Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz.
2. Schranken des Urheberrechts
Dieser Lizenzvertrag lässt sämtliche Befugnisse unberührt, die sich aufgrund der Beschränkungen der ausschliesslichen Rechte des Rechteinhabers durch das Urheberrechtsgesetz (Eigengebrauch, Erschöpfungsgrundsatz etc.) oder durch andere Bestimmungen der anwendbaren Gesetzgebung ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung

den Lizenzgegenstand abzuwandeln, d.h. ihn zu bearbeiten oder in anderer Weise umzugestalten, einschliesslich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jeglicher Art von Medien anzufertigen, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um eine Abwandlung handelt;
den Lizenzgegenstand oder Vervielfältigungen davon zu verbreiten, öffentlich wiederzugeben, durch Radio, Fernsehen oder ähnliche Einrichtungen, auch über Leitungen, zu senden, weiterzusenden oder sonstwie wahrnehmbar zu machen, wobei sich diese Befugnisse auch auf den in eine Sammlung aufgenommenen Lizenzgegenstand erstrecken;
den abgewandelten, d.h. bearbeiteten oder umgestalteten Lizenzgegenstand zu vervielfältigen, verbreiten, öffentlich wiederzugeben, durch Radio, Fernsehen oder ähnliche Einrichtungen, auch über Leitungen, zu senden, weiterzusenden oder sonstwie wahrnehmbar zu machen.
bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche als Gegenleistung für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschliessliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen ausserhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.
Die vorstehend genannten Befugnisse können für alle Nutzungsarten sowie in jedem Medium und Format ausgeübt werden, ob diese bereits bekannt sind oder erst in Zukunft entwickelt werden. Diese Befugnisse umfassen auch das Recht zu Änderungen, die technisch notwendig sind, um die Befugnisse in anderen Medien und Formaten auszuüben.

Sie dürfen keine Vereinbarungen treffen, welche die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verschärfen oder die mit dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte für einen Dritten einschränken. Sie dürfen für den Lizenzgegenstand keine Unterlizenz erteilen. Sie dürfen den Lizenzgegenstand nicht mit technischen Schutzmassnahmen versehen, die den Nutzer des Lizenzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können.  Ziffer 4 Buchstabe a gilt auch, falls der Lizenzgegenstand Bestandteil einer Sammlung ist. Dies bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass die Sammlung als solche diesen Lizenzbestimmungen unterstellt werden muss.  Wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand in eine Sammlung aufnehmen, müssen Sie auf Aufforderung des Urhebers oder jedes Lizenzgebers hin jeden Hinweis auf den Auffordernden soweit machbar und gewünscht aus der Sammlung entfernen; soweit Hinweise gestützt auf eine solche Aufforderung zu entfernen sind, entfallen die Pflichten gemäss Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b. Entsprechendes gilt bei Abwandlungen.  Sie dürfen eine Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes ausschliesslich unter den Bedingungen
dieser Lizenz,
einer späteren Version dieser Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen,
einer rechtsordnungsspezifischen Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts (z.B. Namensnennung - Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 US),
der Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts, oder
einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz
öffentlich wiedergeben oder verbreiten.  Falls Sie die Abwandlung gemäss Abschnitt (v) unter einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen Folge leisten.  Falls Sie die Abwandlungen unter einer der unter (i)-(iv) genannten Lizenzen („Verwendbare Lizenzen“) lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen sowie folgenden Bestimmungen Folge leisten: Sie müssen stets eine Kopie der verwendbaren Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen, wenn Sie die Abwandlung verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen der verwendbaren Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Rechte beschränken. Bei jeder Abwandlung, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise auf die verwendbare Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Wenn Sie die Abwandlung verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf die Abwandlung) keine technischen Massnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer der Abwandlung in der Ausübung der ihm durch die verwendbare Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a gilt auch für den Fall, dass die Abwandlung einen Bestandteil einer Sammlung bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass die Sammlung insgesamt der verwendbaren Lizenz unterstellt werden muss.
Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstands oder einer Abwandlung davon, sei es isoliert oder als Teil einer Sammlung, müssen Sie die bestehenden Copyright-Vermerke vollständig beibehalten bzw. in einem Rahmen wiedergeben, der dem technischen Verfahren und dem Trägermedium der von Ihnen vorgenommenen Nutzung angemessen ist, ausgenommen, es liegt eine Aufforderung zur Entfernung der Angaben gemäss Ziffer 4 Buchstabe a Absatz 3 vor.
Insbesondere müssen Sie (i) den Namen (oder das Pseudonym) des Urhebers sowie den Namen von Dritten nennen, die ein Rechteinhaber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen hat.
Ist Ihnen (ii) der Titel des Lizenzgegenstands bekannt, müssen Sie diesen angeben.
Hat der Lizenzgeber (iii) eine Internetadresse angegeben (z.B. in Form des Uniform Resource Identifier, URI), welche Lizenzinformationen oder Copyright-Vermerke enthält, müssen Sie diese ebenfalls nennen, soweit dies mit angemessenem Aufwand durchführbar ist.
Bei Abwandlungen müssen Sie (iv) einen mit Ziffer 3 Buchstabe b in Einklang stehenden Hinweis darauf anführen, in welcher Form der Lizenzgegenstand in die Abwandlung eingegangen ist (z. B. „Französische Übersetzung des … (Werk) durch … (Urheber)“ oder „Das Drehbuch beruht auf dem Werk des … (Urheber)“).
Die gemäss dieser Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b vorgeschriebenen Hinweise können in jeder angemessenen Weise erfolgen. Bei Abwandlungen oder Sammlungen müssen solche Hinweise hinsichtlich Plazierung und Ausgestaltung mindestens ebenso auffällig und in vergleichbarer Weise ausgeführt werden, wie dies für die anderen Rechteinhaber erfolgte, sofern ein solcher Hinweis für alle beitragenden Lizenzgeber erscheint.  Zur Klarstellung: Die gemäss dieser Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b vorgeschriebenen Hinweise dürfen ausschliesslich in der in diesem Abschnitt beschriebenen Weise und zum Zweck der Zurechnung des Werks zum Urheber, Lizenzgeber bzw. zu Dritten, die ein Urheber bzw. Lizenzgeber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen hat, verwendet werden. Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes dürfen Sie weder implizit noch explizit den Eindruck einer Unterstützung oder Billigung durch diese Personen oder den Eindruck einer sonstigen Verbindung zwischen Ihnen und diesen Personen erwecken, ohne zuvor eine separate schriftliche Einwilligung von den betroffenen Personen eingeholt zu haben.
Ihre Befugnis, den Lizenzgegenstand zu nutzen, findet ihre gesetzliche Grenze in den (Urheber-) Persönlichkeitsrechten des Rechteinhabers, dessen berechtigte geistige und persönliche Interessen bzw. dessen Ansehen oder Ruf durch die Nutzung ohne eine zuvor eingeholte separate schriftliche Einwilligung der betroffenen Personen nicht beeinträchtigt werden dürfen.
5. Keine Gewährleistung
SOFERN VOM LIZENZGEBER NICHT SCHRIFTLICH ANDERS ANERKANNT, ÜBERNIMMT DER LIZENZGEBER KEINE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG FÜR DIE ERTEILTEN BEFUGNISSE.
6. Haftungsausschluss
ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER 5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER NUR FÜR VORSATZ UND GROBE FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT. JEDE ANDERE HAFTUNG IST AUSGESCHLOSSEN, SOWEIT GESETZLICH ZULÄSSIG. FÜR SEINE HILFSPERSONEN HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER IN KEINEM FALL. DIESER HAFTUNGSAUSSCHLUSS GILT AUCH DANN, WENN SIE AUF DIE MÖGLICHKEIT EINER SCHÄDIGUNG HINGEWIESEN HABEN.
7. Beendigung
Diese Lizenz und die darunter eingeräumten Befugnisse fallen ohne weiteres und mit sofortiger Wirkung dahin, wenn Sie die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verletzen. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Lizenzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammlungen unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 und 8 bleiben ungeachtet der Beendigung dieser Lizenz verbindlich.
Die mit dieser Lizenz eingeräumten Befugnisse werden zeitlich uneingeschränkt eingeräumt (freilich höchstens für die Dauer, für welche der Lizenzgegenstand nach dem anwendbaren Recht urheber- bzw. leistungsschutzrechtlich geschützt ist). Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch für einen beliebigen Zeitpunkt das Recht vor, den Lizenzgegenstand unter einer anderen Lizenz weiterzugeben oder die Verbreitung des Lizenzgegenstands ganz zu beenden. Der Lizenzwechsel wird jedoch nicht die Wirkung eines Widerrufs dieser Lizenz haben (oder jeder anderen Lizenzierung, die auf der Grundlage dieser Lizenz erfolgt oder erfolgen muss), vielmehr wird die Lizenz so lange weiter bestehen, als sie nicht nach Ziffer 7 Buchstabe a vorstehend beendigt wurde.
8. Verschiedenes
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand oder eine Sammlung gestützt auf Ziffer 3 dieser Lizenz nutzen, räumt der Lizenzgeber auch dem Empfänger eines allfälligen Vervielfältigungsstücks eine Lizenz am Lizenzgegenstand selber ein, und zwar zu denselben Bedingungen wie die Ihnen eingeräumte Lizenz.
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes gestützt auf Ziffer 3 dieser Lizenz nutzen, räumt der Lizenzgeber auch dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Lizenzgegenstand an, und zwar zu denselben Bedingungen wie die Ihnen eingeräumte Lizenz.
Sollten sich einzelne Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz nach dem anwendbaren Recht als nicht durchsetzbar oder nichtig erweisen, so bleiben die übrigen Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz gültig und durchsetzbar und an die Stelle der unwirksamen Bestimmung tritt eine Ersatzregelung, die dem mit der unwirksamen Bestimmung angestrebten Zweck am nächsten kommt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz gilt als wegbedungen und keine Verletzung als genehmigt, bevor nicht die durch die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung belastete Partei die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung in Schriftform und unterschriftlich bestätigt hat.
Diese Lizenz enthält alle mit Blick auf den Lizenzgegenstand zwischen den Parteien massgeblichen Bestimmungen. Andere Vertrauenspositionen, Abreden oder Zusicherungen im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand bestehen nicht. Der Lizenzgeber ist durch keine zusätzliche Klausel gebunden, welche sich aus irgendwelchen Unterlagen von Ihnen ergibt. Diese Vereinbarung kann ohne vorherige Vereinbarung mit unterschriftlicher Bestätigung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen nicht abgeändert werden.

LA SOCIÉTÉ CREATIVE COMMONS N'EST PAS UNE ÉTUDE D'AVOCATS ET NE FOURNIT PAS DE CONSEILS OU DE SERVICES JURIDIQUES. LA DISTRIBUTION DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE NE CRÉE AUCUN MANDAT ENTRE SON UTILISATEUR ET CREATIVE COMMONS. CREATIVE COMMONS LIVRE CES INFORMATION « TEL QUEL » ET NE FOURNIT AUCUNE GARANTIE EN RELATION AVEC CETTE LICENCE ET LES INFORMATIONS QU’ELLE CONTIENT ET SE DÉCHARGE DE TOUTE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR TOUT DOMMAGE POUVANT RÉSULTER DE SON UTILISATION. CETTE LIMITATION DE RESPONSABILITÉ S’ÉTEND ÉGALEMENT AUX PERSONNES QUI ONT PARTICIPÉ À L’ADAPTATION DE LA LICENCE AU DROIT SUISSE.
Licence
En exerçant l’un des droits concernés par cette licence, Vous acceptez que les termes de la présente licence soient juridiquement contraignantes. Pour autant que la présente licence puisse être considérée comme un contrat, le donneur de licence Vous autorise à utiliser sans contrepartie les droits figurant dans cette licence à condition que vous acceptiez de Vous conformer strictement à ses termes.
Le « Donneur de licence », à savoir la personne qui met l’Objet de la Licence à disposition aux conditions qu’elle contient,  et  « Vous », à savoir la personne physique ou morale, qui utilisez, au sens de l’article 3 de la présente Licence, l’Objet de la Licence conformément aux termes de la présente Licence acceptez, sous réserve d’une autorisation expresse du Donneur de licence de Vous en écarter, de Vous conformer strictement aux conditions d’utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence contenues dans la présente Licence indépendamment de toute utilisation contraire qui aurait pu en être faite par le passé :
1. Définitions
L’ « Objet de la licence » peut être une Œuvre protégée par le droit d’auteur ou une prestation protégée par des droits voisins.
Un « Recueil » au sens de la présente Licence est une compilation de l’Objet de la licence avec d'autres œuvres ou d'autres éléments, indépendamment du fait que le Recueil en tant que tel jouisse d’un droit d’auteur en raison du choix ou de la disposition de son contenu. Par « Recueil », il faut entendre les bases de données, indépendamment du fait qu’elles jouissent d’un droit d’auteur en raison du choix ou de la disposition de leur contenu. Le fait d’incorporer l’Objet de la licence dans un Recueil n’équivaut pas à une Modification de l'Objet de licence.
Une « Modification » au sens de la présente Licence signifie tout changement de l’Objet de la licence, en particulier, toute transformation, œuvre dérivée, modification, adaptation ou traduction, aussi longtemps que le caractère unique de l’Objet de licence demeure reconnaissable. Le fait d’incorporer l’Object de la licence dans un Recueil n’équivaut pas à une Modification.
« Titulaire des droits » comprend l'auteur de l’Objet de la licence, les titulaires de droits voisins, ou toute autre personne ayant acquis des droits en relation avec l’Objet de la licence et qui est autorisée à accorder des licences ou sous-licences à des tiers.
Une « Œuvre » est une création de l’esprit, littéraire ou artistique, qui a un caractère individuel.
Un « Droit voisin » est un droit relatif à une prestation culturelle, qui n'est pas protégé en tant qu'Œuvre, tels que ceux des artistes interprètes, producteurs de phonogrammes et de vidéogrammes et des organismes de radiodiffusion.
« Représentation publique » est la représentation, la récitation, la projection ou la mise à disposition de l’Objet de la licence directement ou par tout autre moyen permettant aux personnes présentes en un lieu et à un moment donné d’y avoir accès.
« Reproduire » signifie une reproduction de l’Objet de la licence en utilisant n'importe quel moyen de reproduction temporaire ou permanent, y compris l'exploitation de la première fixation physique de l'Objet de la licence et la production de copies de cette fixation ainsi que le transfert de l’Objet de la licence sur tout support visuel ou sonore ou tout autre support électronique, que ce soit sous forme numérique ou analogique.
« Diffuser » signifie mettre à disposition du public ou mettre en circulation l’Objet de la licence ou des Modifications sous forme originale ou sous forme de reproductions physiques.
Par « Eléments de la Licence », il faut entendre les éléments choisis par le Donneur de licence et les caractéristiques figurant dans le titre de la Licence, soit en l’occurrence : « Paternité » et « Partage à l’Identique ».
Par « Licence compatible avec les licences Creative Commons », il faut entendre une licence qui figure sur la liste contenue sur la page suivante : https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses et qui est reconnue par Creative Commons comme étant fondamentalement équivalente à la présente Licence étant entendu qu’elle doit contenir au minimum les éléments suivants :
conditions qui poursuivent le même but, qui ont le même sens et qui déploient le même effet que les éléments de la Licence concernée ; et
autorisation expresse de soumettre les Modifications apportées à l’Objet de la Licence à une licence Creative Commons adaptée à un autre ordre juridique mais contenant les mêmes Eléments de licence que la présente Licence ou sous une licence Creative-Commons-Unported équivalente.
2. Restrictions du droit d’auteur
La présente Licence n’a pas pour effet de limiter les droits découlant des restrictions au droit d'auteur (utilisation à des fins privées, principe de l'épuisement, etc.) ou d'autres lois applicables.
3. Licences
En vertu des termes de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence Vous accorde le droit non exclusif d’utiliser l’Objet de la licence dans le monde entier, libre de redevance, pour une durée indéterminée (pour la durée de la protection de l’Œuvre par le droit d’auteur ou les droits voisins) comme suit :
Reproduire l’Objet de la Licence, l’incorporer dans un Recueil et le reproduire une fois incorporé dans le Recueil.
Modifier l’Objet de la licence, c’est-à-dire en faire des œuvres dérivées, des traductions ou le transformer d’une autre manière en utilisant n'importe quel type de média, aussi longtemps qu’il est clairement indiqué qu’il s’agit d’une Modification.
Diffuser ou rendre accessible au public l’Objet de la licence ou des copies de celui-ci, que ce soit par le biais de la radio, la télévision ou de toute installation similaire, y compris par le câble, permettant de le diffuser, de le rediffuser ou de le rendre perceptible de toute autre manière, étant précisé que ces prérogatives s'étendent aux Recueils lorsque l’Objet de la licence y est incorporé.
Reproduire, diffuser ou rendre accessible au public les Modifications de l’Objet de la Licence, que ce soit par le biais de la radio, la télévision ou de toute installation similaire, y compris par le câble, permettant de le diffuser, de le rediffuser ou de le rendre perceptible de toute autre manière.
La rémunération pour l'utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence est soumise aux principes suivants :
Système de rémunération légale obligatoire : dans les cas où il existe un système de rémunération légale obligatoire en échange de licences légales ou un système de redevance forfaitaire (par exemple, pour les supports vierges), le Donneur de licence se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances pour chacune des utilisations que Vous faites d’un droit faisant l’objet de cette Licence ;
Système de rémunération lié à l’octroi de licences obligatoires : dans les cas où des licences obligatoires n’étant pas comprises dans cette Licence entrent en considération, le Donneur de licence renonce à toute rémunération pour toute utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence que Vous seriez amené à faire en vertu d’une licence obligatoire ;
Autres cas de rémunération : le Donneur de licence renonce à toute rémunération pour toute utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence conformément aux termes de celle-ci et qui ne tombe pas sous le coup des deux sections précédentes (i) et (ii), indépendamment du fait que la collecte des droits d’auteur puisse se faire par le Donneur de licence lui-même ou doive impérativement passer par une société de gestion.
Les prérogatives figurant ci-dessus valent pour tous types d'utilisation et tous types de médias ou de formats connus ou futurs. Ces prérogatives comprennent le droit d'apporter des modifications qui sont techniquement nécessaires pour pouvoir les exercer sur d’autres supports ou dans d’autres formats.
4. Conditions
Les autorisations accordées au chiffre 3 ci-dessus sont soumises aux conditions suivantes :
Pour chaque exercice d’un droit conféré par cette Licence, Vous devez remettre une copie de cette Licence. Vous pouvez y renoncer si Vous la rendez accessible à quiconque sous la forme d’un « Uniform Resource Identifier » (ci-après : « URI »). Lorsque Vous exercez un droit en vertu de la présente Licence, Vous devez maintenir toutes les références à cette Licence et aux clauses d’exclusion de garantie et de responsabilité. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à conclure un accord qui durcirait les conditions de la présente Licence ou qui soumettrait les droits garantis par cette Licence à des restrictions vis-à-vis des tiers. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à accorder des sous-licences en relation avec l’Objet de la Licence. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à soumettre l’Objet de la Licence à des mesures de protection techniques qui empêcheraient ses utilisateurs d’exercer les droits garantis par la présente Licence.  La présente disposition (article 4 let. a) s’applique également dans les cas où l’Objet de la Licence est incorporé à un Recueil, indépendamment du fait que ledit Recueil soit en tant que tel soumis aux conditions de la présente Licence.  Lorsque Vous incorporez l’Objet de la Licence dans un Recueil, Vous devez, à la requête du Titulaire des droits ou de tout Donneur de licence et dans la mesure du possible, retirer du Recueil toute référence au requérant ; dès lors que les références sont retirées sur la base d’une telle requête, les obligations de l’article 4 let. b sont applicables. La même obligation vaut pour les Modifications.  Vous êtes uniquement autorisé à diffuser et à rendre accessible au public une Modification à l’Objet de la Licence aux conditions :
de la présente Licence ;
d’une version ultérieure à la présente Licence contenant les mêmes Eléments de la Licence que la présente Licence ;
d’une licence Creative Commons adaptée à un autre ordre juridique contenant les mêmes Eléments de la Licence que la version 3.0 ou les versions ultérieures (par exemple : Paternité – Partage à l’Identique 3.0 US) ;
d’une licence Creative-Commons-Unported contenant les mêmes Eléments de la Licence que la version 3.0 ou les versions ultérieures ; ou
d’une licence compatible avec une licence Creative Commons.
Dans les cas où la Modification est donnée en licence en vertu d’une licence compatible avec une licence Creative Commons conformément à la Section (v) ci-dessus, Vous êtes tenu de respecter les conditions de ladite licence.  A chaque diffusion ou représentation publique de la Modification en vertu des licences énumérées sous les Sections (i)-(iv) ci-dessus, Vous êtes tenu de respecter les conditions de ces licences ainsi que les conditions suivantes :
Vous devez toujours remettre une copie de la licence applicable ou indiquer l’adresse internet sous la forme d’un URI ;
Vous ne devez proposer ou ajouter aucune condition contractuelle ou d’utilisation qui ait pour effet de limiter les conditions de la licence applicable ou les droits qu’elle accorde ;
Vous devez respecter toutes les mentions légales figurant dans la licence applicable et laisser inchangée la clause d’exclusion de responsabilité ;
Vous ne devez exercer aucune mesure technique en relation avec la Modification qui empêcherait l’utilisateur de la Modification d’exercer les droits qui lui sont garantis par la licence applicable.
Cette Section 4 let. a est également valable dans les cas où la Modification est incorporée à un Recueil, ce qui n’implique pas pour autant que le Recueil en tant que tel dusse être soumis aux conditions de la licence applicable.
Pour chaque diffusion, mise à disposition du public de l’Objet de la Licence ou de Modifications, que ce soit de manière individuelle ou dans le cadre d’un Recueil, Vous devez, à moins qu’une requête au sens de l’article 4 let. a ne Vous ait été adressée, faire en sorte que toutes les mentions légales relatives au droit d’auteur en relation avec l’Objet de la Licence demeurent intactes et faire en sorte, dans les limites des moyens techniques et des supports que Vous utilisez, que les indications suivantes figurent dans la mention légale relative au droit d’auteur :
Nom de l’auteur original (ou, le cas échéant, son pseudonyme) ou le nom de tiers figurant dans la mention légale initiale ;
Le titre de l’Œuvre, pour autant qu’il Vous soit connu ;
L’adresse internet (par exemple sous la forme d’Uniform Resource Identifier, URI) qui contient les informations relatives à la Licence ou la mention légale relative au droit d’auteur pour autant que cela puisse raisonnablement être mis en œuvre ;
Pour les Modifications, une mention légale conforme à l’article 3 let. b permettant d’identifier l’utilisation de l’œuvre faite dans le cadre de la Modification (par exemple : « Traduction française de … (Œuvre) par … (auteur) » ou « scénario basé sur l’œuvre originale de … (auteur original) »).
Les mentions légales requises par l’article 4 let. b peuvent être indiquées de toute manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas de Modifications ou de Recueils, s’il figure une mention légale pour tous les auteurs ayant contribué à la Modification ou au Recueil, alors la mention légale pour chacun des auteurs doit être au minimum d’une importance comparable à celle des autres auteurs ayant participé à la Modification ou au Recueil.  Pour clarification : les mentions légales requises par cet article 4 let. b ne peuvent être utilisées que pour attribuer la paternité de l’Œuvre conformément aux obligations contenues dans la présente Licence, et, en exerçant Vos droits dans le cadre de la présente Licence, Vous n’êtes pas autorisé à prétendre de manière directe ou indirecte ou à laisser penser qu’il existe un parrainage entre Vous et l’auteur original, le Donneur de licence et/ou les auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre avec Vous ou que l’auteur original, le Donneur de licence et/ou les auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre avec Vous approuvent votre travail ou l’utilisation que Vous faites de l’Œuvre sans autorisation séparée, expresse et préalable de l’auteur original, du Donneur de licence ou des auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre.
Votre possibilité d’utiliser l’Objet de la Licence trouve ses limites dans les droits de la personnalité et les droits moraux du Titulaire des droits, lequel a le droit à ce que son intégrité intellectuelle et personnelle, ainsi que son honneur et sa réputation ne soient pas atteints sans une autorisation écrite préalable séparée.
5. Exclusion de garantie
A MOINS D’UN ENGAGEMENT ÉCRIT CONTRAIRE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE DONNE AUCUNE GARANTIE EN RELATION AVEC LES PRÉROGATIVES ACCORDÉES EN VERTU DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE.
6. Limitation de responsabilité
LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE RÉPOND QUE DES DOMMAGES INTENTIONNELS OU RÉSULTANT DE SA NÉGLIGENCE GRAVE EN RELATION AVEC LES GARANTIES DONNÉES EN VERTU DE L’ARTICLE 5. TOUTE AUTRE RESPONSABILITÉ DU DONNEUR DE LICENCE EST EXCLUE, POUR AUTANT QUE CELA SOIT LICITE. LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE RÉPOND EN AUCUN CAS DE SES AUXILIAIRES. LA PRÉSENTE EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ EST ÉGALEMENT APPLICABLE DANS LES CAS OÙ VOUS AURIEZ ÉTÉ AVISÉ DE LA POSSIBILITÉ D’UN DÉDOMMAGEMENT.
7. Résiliation
Cette Licence - et les droits qu’elle contient – prendra fin automatiquement et avec effet immédiat en cas de violation de l’un de ses termes. Les personnes physiques et morales qui ont reçu des Modifications ou des Recueils de votre part sur la base de cette Licence pourront néanmoins continuer à les utiliser sur la base de leurs licences, pour autant, toutefois, que ces personnes physiques ou morales se conforment strictement aux termes de ces licences. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 resteront en vigueur en cas de résiliation de cette Licence.
Les droits accordés par la présente Licence sont accordés pour une durée indéterminée (pour la durée de protection de l’Objet de la Licence en vertu du droit applicable en matière de droit d’auteur ou de droits voisins) aux conditions contenues dans la présente Licence. Nonobstant ce qui précède, le droit du Donneur de licence de publier l’Œuvre sous d’autres termes contractuels ou d’arrêter de diffuser l’Œuvre à tout moment est réservé, à condition, toutefois, que cette décision n’ait pas pour effet d’annuler la présente Licence (ou toute licence qui a été, ou qui doit être accordée sur la base de cette Licence), étant précisé que dans ce cas de figure la présente Licence restera en vigueur jusqu’à sa résiliation conformément à ce qui précède.
8. Divers
Chaque fois que Vous utilisez l’Objet de la Licence ou un Recueil conformément à l’article 3 de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence accorde au destinataire de l’Objet de la Licence ou du Recueil une licence semblable à celle-ci, aux mêmes conditions, valant pour l’utilisation de l’Œuvre.
Chaque fois que Vous utilisez une Modification de l’Objet de la Licence sur la base de l’article 3 de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence accorde au destinataire de la Modification une licence semblable à celle-ci, aux mêmes conditions, valant pour l’utilisation de l’œuvre originale.
Dans l’hypothèse où une disposition contenue dans la présente Licence devait être considérée comme nulle ou ne pourrait être exécutée en vertu du droit applicable, les autres dispositions de la présente Licence demeureraient pleinement valables et exécutoires et la disposition inefficace devrait être remplacée par une disposition conforme au but recherché par la présente Licence.
Aucune renonciation des termes ou dispositions de la présente Licence ne pourra être acceptée et aucune violation ne pourra être consentie sans l’accord écrit et signé par la partie concernée par cette renonciation ou ce consentement.
La présente Licence constitue le seul accord entre les parties à propos de l’Objet de la Licence. Il n'existe aucun accord ou garantie portant sur l’Objet de la Licence en dehors des éléments mentionnés ici. Le Donneur de licence ne sera tenu par aucune disposition complémentaire qui pourrait figurer dans une communication de Votre part. Cette Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord mutuel écrit des Parties.
Note Creative Commons
Creative Commons n'est pas partie à la présente Licence et ne donne aucune garantie quant à l’Objet sous Licence. Creative Commons ne peut être tenue responsable envers Vous ou toute partie sur la base d’aucune théorie juridique pour tout dommage, que ce soit pour des dommages directs, des indirects ou consécutifs survenus en relation avec cette Licence. Nonobstant les deux (2) phrases précédentes, si Creative Commons a expressément reconnu agir comme Donneur de Licence, elle répondra vis-à-vis de Vous de la même manière que le Donneur de Licence.
Creative Commons n’autorise aucune partie à utiliser la marque « Creative Commons » ou toute autre marque ou logo de Creative Commons sans l'accord préalable écrit de Creative Commons, sauf pour indiquer au public que l’Œuvre est mise à disposition sous licence CCPL.

LA OBRA (TAL Y COMO SE DEFINE MÁS ADELANTE) SE OTORGA BAJO ESTA LICENCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS ("LPCC" O "LICENCIA"). LA OBRA ESTÁ PROTEGIDA POR DERECHOS DE AUTOR Y/U OTRAS LEYES APLICABLES. QUEDA PROHIBIDO CUALQUIER OTRO USO QUE SE HAGA DE LA OBRA QUE NO CUENTE CON LA AUTORIZACIÓN PERTINENTE DE CONFORMIDAD CON LOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTA LICENCIA Y DE LA LEY SOBRE DERECHOS DE AUTOR.

1. Definiciones
"Adaptación", también llamada "Obra Derivada", es aquella creación basada en la Obra, o basada en la Obra y otras creaciones preexistentes, tales como una traducción, una obra derivada, arreglo musical u otra modificación de una obra literaria o artística, o de un fonograma o interpretación, e incluye las adaptaciones cinematográficas o cualquier otra forma en que la Obra pueda ser transformada o modificada, comprendiendo cualquier forma reconocible derivada de la original, que constituya una creación autónoma , excepto que una obra forme parte de una Colección, en cuyo caso no será considerada una Adaptación para los fines de esta Licencia. Para evitar dudas, cuando la Obra es una creación musical, interpretación o fonograma, la sincronización de ella en cuanto al tiempo en relación con la imagen en movimiento será considerada una Adaptación para los fines de esta Licencia.

1. Definitionen
Der Begriff "Abwandlung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes.
Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.
"Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
Unter "Lizenzelementen" werden im Sinne dieser Lizenz die folgenden übergeordneten Lizenzcharakteristika verstanden, die vom Lizenzgeber ausgewählt wurden und in der Bezeichnung der Lizenz zum Ausdruck kommen: "Namensnennung", "Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen".
Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt.
"Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist.
Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" im Sinne dieser Lizenz.
Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben.
Unter "Öffentlich Zeigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.
"Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form.
"Mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz" bezeichnet eine Lizenz, die unter https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses aufgelistet ist und die durch Creative Commons als grundsätzlich zur vorliegenden Lizenz äquivalent akzeptiert wurde, da zumindest folgende Voraussetzungen erfüllt sind:
Diese mit Creative Commons kompatible Lizenz
enthält Bestimmungen, welche die gleichen Ziele verfolgen, die gleiche Bedeutung haben und die gleichen Wirkungen erzeugen wie die Lizenzelemente der vorliegenden Lizenz; und
erlaubt ausdrücklich das Lizenzieren von ihr unterstellten Abwandlungen unter vorliegender Lizenz, unter einer anderen rechtsordnungsspezifisch angepassten Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen, wie sie die vorliegende Lizenz aufweist, oder unter der entsprechenden Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz.
2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts
Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben.
3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten
Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.e) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ("unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann"):
Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;
Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes anzufertigen, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jedweder Medien, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um Abwandlungen handelt;
den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten;
Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten.
Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.
Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte.
4. Bedingungen
Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Abwandlung vornehmen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Abwandlung die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen.
Sie dürfen eine Abwandlung ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen
dieser Lizenz,
einer späteren Version dieser Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen,
einer rechtsordnungsspezifischen Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts (z.B. Namensnennung - Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 US),
der Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts, oder
einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz
verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen.
Falls Sie die Abwandlung gemäß Abschnitt (v) unter einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen Folge leisten.
Falls Sie die Abwandlungen unter einer der unter (i)-(iv) genannten Lizenzen ("Verwendbare Lizenzen") lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen sowie folgenden Bestimmungen Folge leisten: Sie müssen stets eine Kopie der verwendbaren Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen, wenn Sie die Abwandlung verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen der verwendbaren Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Rechte beschränken. Bei jeder Abwandlung, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise auf die verwendbare Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Wenn Sie die Abwandlung verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf die Abwandlung) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer der Abwandlung in der Ausübung der ihm durch die verwendbare Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.b) gilt auch für den Fall, dass die Abwandlung einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt der verwendbaren Lizenz unterstellt werden muss.
Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Abwandlungen oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben:
Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ("Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
den Titel des Inhaltes;
in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand;
und im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine Abwandlung handelt.
Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten.
Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen.
Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt.
5. Gewährleistung
SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT, SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT.
6. Haftungsbeschränkung
DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR, SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG.
7. Erlöschen
Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort.
Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.
8. Sonstige Bestimmungen
Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat.
Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß Ziffern 8.a) und b) angeboteten Lizenzen aus.
Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung.

Concesión de la Licencia.- Sujeto a los términos y a las condiciones de esta Licencia, el Licenciante otorga al Licenciatario una Licencia mundial, sin cobro de regalías, no exclusiva e indefinida (depende del acuerdo de los contratantes de la Licencia), para ejercer los derechos de Licenciatario de la Obra, tal como se estipulan a continuación:
Reproducir la Obra, e incorporarla en una o más Colecciones, y a reproducir la Obra tal como se incorpora en las Colecciones;
A crear y reproducir Obras Derivadas siempre y cuando dicha Obra Derivada, incluyendo cualquier traducción en cualquier medio, efectúe los pasos razonables para claramente colocar etiquetas, demarcar, o identificar de alguna otra manera los cambios que se realizaron en la Obra original. Por ejemplo, una traducción debe marcarse como “El trabajo original fue traducido de inglés a español”, o una modificación deberá indicar “El trabajo original fue modificado”;
A distribuir y ejecutar públicamente la Obra incluyendo aquella cuando se incorpora en Colecciones; y,
A distribuir y ejecutar públicamente la Obra Derivada.
Para evitar todas las dudas, el Licenciante renuncia al derecho de recaudar regalías, sea individualmente o en el caso en que el Licenciante sea miembro de una sociedad de recaudaciones que maneje esquemas de Licencias voluntarias, mediante dicha sociedad, cuando el Licenciatario ejerza cualquier derecho otorgado según esta Licencia.
Se podrán ejercer dichos derechos en todos los formatos y medios, sean conocidos ahora o se conozcan en el futuro. Los derechos anteriores incluyen el derecho a realizar dichas modificaciones que sean técnicamente necesarias para ejercer los derechos en otros medios y formatos. Todos los derechos no cedidos expresamente por el Licenciante quedan reservados.
4. Restricciones.- La Licencia otorgada en la Sección 3 se sujeta expresamente y se limita según las siguientes restricciones:
El Licenciatario podrá distribuir o ejecutar públicamente la Obra solamente según las condiciones de esta Licencia. Deberá incluir una copia del Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI, por su sigla en inglés) para esta Licencia con cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente. El Licenciatario no podrá ofrecer ni imponer ninguna condición en la Obra que pueda restringir los términos de esta Licencia ni la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra para ejercer los derechos otorgados según las condiciones de esta Licencia. No podrá otorgar sub-licencias de la Obra. Deberá mantener sin modificaciones todas las notificaciones que se refieren a esta Licencia y a los descargos de responsabilidades con cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente. Cuando el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra, el Licenciatario no podrá imponer ninguna medida tecnológica vigente en la Obra que pueda restringir la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra por parte del Licenciatario para ejercer los derechos otorgados al receptor, según las condiciones de esta Licencia. Se aplica esta Sección 4(a) a la Obra tal como se incorpora en una Colección, pero para esto no hace falta que la Colección, aparte de la Obra en sí, esté sujeta a las condiciones de esta Licencia. Si el Licenciatario es Autor de una Colección, cuando reciba la notificación de cualquier Licenciante, el Licenciatario debe; en la medida en que sea práctico, retirar de la Colección cualquier crédito tal como se requiere de acuerdo con la Sección 4(c), según se solicite. Si el Licenciatario crea una Obra Derivada, cuando reciba la notificación de cualquier Licenciante, el Licenciatario debe; en la medida en que sea práctico, retirar de la Obra Derivada cualquier crédito tal como se requiere de acuerdo a la Sección 4(c), según se solicite.
El Licenciatario puede distribuir o ejecutar públicamente una Obra Derivada solamente bajo los siguientes parámetros: (i) las condiciones de esta Licencia; (ii) una versión posterior de esta Licencia con los mismos elementos de Licencia que esta Licencia; (iii) la Licencia Creative Commons Unported u otra Licencia de jurisdicción de Creative Commons (sea por esta versión de Licencia o una posterior) que contenga los mismos elementos de Licencia que esta Licencia (por ejemplo, Atribución - Compartir Igual 3.0 US) (la “Licencia Aplicable”); (iv) una Licencia Compatible de Creative Commons. Si el Licenciante ofrece una Obra Derivada bajo una de las Licencias mencionadas en el inciso (iv), debe cumplir con los términos de esa Licencia. Si el Licenciante ofrece la Obra Derivada bajo los términos de cualquiera de las Licencias mencionadas en (i), (ii) o (iii) (“la Licencia Aplicable”), debe cumplir con los términos de la Licencia Aplicable de forma general y con las siguientes disposiciones: (I) El Licenciante deberá incluir una copia del Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI, por su sigla en inglés) para esta Licencia, con cada copia de cada Obra Derivada que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente; (II) El Licenciatario no podrá ofrecer ni imponer ninguna condición en la Obra Derivada que pueda restringir los términos de la Licencia Aplicable ni la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra Derivada para ejercer los derechos otorgados al receptor según las condiciones de la Licencia Aplicable; (III) El Licenciante deberá mantener sin modificaciones todas las notificaciones que se refieren a la Licencia Aplicable y a los descargos de las garantías con cada copia de la Obra tal como se incluya en la Obra Derivada que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente; y, (IV) Cuando el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra Derivada, el Licenciatario no podrá imponer ninguna medida tecnológica vigente en la Obra Derivada que pueda restringir la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra Derivada del Licenciatario para ejercer los derechos otorgados al receptor según las condiciones de la Licencia Aplicable. Se aplica esta Sección 4(b) a la Obra Derivada tal como se incorpora en una Colección, pero para esto no hace falta que la Colección, aparte de la Obra Derivada en sí, esté sujeta a las condiciones de la Licencia Aplicable.
Si el Licenciatario distribuye o ejecuta públicamente la Obra o cualquier Obra Derivada o Colección, el Licenciatario debe, excepto si se ha presentado una solicitud según la Sección 4(a), mantener intactas todas las notificaciones de Derechos de Autor de la Obra e incluir, de forma razonable, dependiendo del medio o forma que el Licenciatario está usando: (i) el nombre del Autor (o seudónimo, si fuera aplicable) si fuera suministrado el nombre de dicha parte o partes, y/o si el Autor y/o el Licenciante designaran cualquier otra parte o partes (por ejemplo, un instituto auspiciante, una entidad de publicación, una revista) para el reconocimiento (las “Partes del Reconocimiento”) en la notificación de Derechos de Autor o condiciones del servicio del Licenciante o por otros medios razonables; (ii) el título de la Obra si fuera suministrado; (iii) en la medida en que sea práctico, el Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI), si lo hubiere, que el Licenciante especifique que está asociado con la Obra; excepto si dicho URI no se refiere a la notificación del Derecho de Autor ni a la información de Licencias para la Obra; y, (iv) en forma coherente con la Sección 3(b), en el caso de una Obra Derivada, un crédito que identifique el uso de la Obra en la Obra Derivada (por ejemplo, “Traducción al francés del Trabajo por el Autor”, o “Guión basado en el Trabajo original por el Autor”). Se podrá implementar el crédito requerido por esta Sección 4(c) en cualquier forma razonable; siempre y cuando, en el caso de una Obra Derivada o Colección, por lo menos, aparezca dicho crédito, si aparece un crédito de todos los autores que contribuyeron a la Obra Derivada o a la Colección, como una parte de estos créditos y de una forma, por lo menos, tan destacada como los créditos de los demás autores que contribuyeron. Para evitar toda duda, el Licenciatario solamente podrá usar el crédito requerido por esta Sección con el propósito de reconocimiento en la manera anteriormente descrita y, al ejercer sus derechos según esta Licencia, el Licenciatario no podrá implícita ni tácitamente aseverar ni dar a entender ninguna conexión, auspicio ni respaldo por parte del Autor, Licenciante ni Partes del Reconocimiento, según corresponda, otorgado al Licenciatario o a su uso de la Obra, sin el permiso independiente, expreso, previo y escrito del Autor, el Licenciante y/o las Partes del Reconocimiento.
Los derechos concedidos en la Sección 3 se deben ejercer teniendo en cuenta los Derechos Morales del Autor para objetar cualquier alteración, mutilación o deformación u otra acción despectiva en relación al trabajo, que pudiera resultar perjudicial para el honor o reputación del Autor o de su dignidad como tal en la medida que el Autor no puede renunciar a los Derechos Morales bajo las disposiciones legales aplicables.
5. Declaraciones, Exoneración de Garantía y Responsabilidad
SALVO PACTO EN CONTRARIO DE AMBAS PARTES, QUE CONSTE POR ESCRITO, Y EN LA MAYOR EXTENSIÓN DE LO PERMITIDO POR LAS LEYES VIGENTES, EL LICENCIANTE OFRECE LA OBRA EN SUS CONDICIONES ACTUALES. EL AUTOR GARANTIZA LA AUTORÍA Y ORIGINALIDAD DE LA OBRA, SIN EMBARGO NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA SOBRE LA CALIDAD COMERCIAL DE LA OBRA O SU ADECUACIÓN PARA UN PROPÓSITO EN PARTICULAR.
6. Limitación de Responsabilidad.
SALVO QUE LA LEY APLICABLE LO EXIJA EXPRESAMENTE, EL LICENCIANTE EN NINGÚN CASO PODRÁ SER RESPONSABLE ANTE EL LICENCIATARIO POR NINGÚN DAÑO ESPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RESULTANTE, PUNITIVO NI EJEMPLAR QUE SURGIERA POR ESTA LICENCIA NI POR EL USO DE LA OBRA.
7. Terminación
Esta Licencia y los derechos otorgados por esta Licencia terminarán automáticamente si el Licenciatario incumpliera cualquiera de las condiciones de esta Licencia. Sin embargo, si hay individuos o entidades que hayan recibido Obras Derivadas o Colecciones de parte del Licenciatario bajo esta Licencia, sus Licencias no terminarán, siempre y cuando dichos individuos o entidades cumplan por completo las condiciones de esas Licencias. Las Secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 se mantendrán ante cualquier terminación de esta Licencia.
Sujeto a las condiciones y términos antes mencionados, la Licencia otorgada aquí se concede por el tiempo que dura la protección de los Derechos de Autor de la Obra. No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho de emitir o publicar esta Obra bajo los términos de Licencias diferentes o a dejar de distribuir la Obra en cualquier momento; siempre y cuando dicha opción no cumpla el propósito de revocar esta Licencia (o cualquier otra Licencia adicional que haya sido, o que deba, ser otorgada según las condiciones de esta Licencia) y la misma continuará en plena vigencia y efecto, excepto si terminare según las estipulaciones previas.
8. Asuntos diversos
Cada vez que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra o una Colección, el Licenciante ofrecerá al receptor una Licencia para la Obra en las mismas condiciones y términos que la Licencia otorgada al Licenciatario según esta Licencia.
Cada vez que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra Derivada, el Licenciante ofrecerá al receptor una Licencia para la Obra original en las mismas condiciones y términos que la Licencia otorgada al Licenciatario según esta Licencia.
Si cualquier estipulación de esta Licencia no fuera válida ni exigible según las leyes aplicables, este hecho no afectará la validez o exigibilidad del resto de condiciones de esta Licencia, y sin que se requiera ninguna acción adicional de las partes de este acuerdo, se cambiará dicha estipulación en lo estrictamente necesario para que dicha estipulación sea válida y exigible.
No se considerará que se ha renunciado a ninguna estipulación ni condición de esta Licencia ni se considerará que se ha aceptado ningún incumplimiento excepto si dicha renuncia o consentimiento fuera por escrito y en éste constare la firma de las partes.
Esta Licencia constituye el acuerdo completo entre las partes con respecto a la Obra, cuya Licencia se otorga mediante este documento. No hay acuerdos, puntos de compromiso ni declaraciones con respecto a la Obra que no estén estipulados en el presente. El Licenciante no tendrá la obligación de cumplir ninguna estipulación adicional que podrá incluirse en cualquier comunicación enviada por el Licenciatario. No se podrá modificar esta Licencia sin el consentimiento escrito del Licenciante y del Licenciatario.

Llicència 
L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ TAL COM ES DEFINEIX MÉS ENDAVANT, S'OFEREIX SEGONS ELS TERMES D'AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS (D'ARA ENDAVANT CCPL O LLICÈNCIA). L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ ESTÀ PROTEGIDA PER LA LLEI ESPANYOLA DE PROPIETAT INTEL·LECTUAL O QUALSEVOL ALTRA NORMA APLICABLE. QUEDA PROHIBIT QUALSEVOL ÚS DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ DIFERENT DEL QUE AUTORITZI AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA O DISPOSIN LES LLEIS DE PROPIETAT INTEL·LECTUAL. 
L'EXERCICI DE QUALSEVOL DRET SOBRE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ COMPORTA QUE ACCEPTEU LES LIMITACIONS I OBLIGACIONS D'AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA I HI CONSENTIU, SENSE PERJUDICI DE LA NECESSITAT DE CONSENTIMENT EXPRÉS EN CAS DE VIOLACIÓ PRÈVIA DE LES SEVES CONDICIONS. EL LLICENCIADOR US CONCEDEIX ELS DRETS CONTINGUTS EN AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA, SEMPRE QUE N'ACCEPTEU LES CONDICIONS QUE HI SÓN PRESENTS. 
1. Definicions 
L'obra és la creació literària, artística o científica oferta en els termes d'aquesta llicència. 
En aquesta llicència es considera una prestació qualsevol interpretació, execució, fonograma, enregistrament audiovisual, emissió o transmissió, mera fotografia o qualsevol altre objecte protegit per la legislació de propietat intel·lectual vigent aplicable. 
L'aplicació d'aquesta llicència a una col·lecció (definida més endavant) afectarà únicament l'estructura com a forma d'expressió de la selecció o disposició dels continguts, i no es farà extensiva a aquests. En aquest cas la col·lecció tindrà la consideració d'obra a efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
El titular originari és: 
En el cas d'una obra literària, artística o científica, la persona natural o el grup de persones que l'ha creada. 
En el cas d'una obra col·lectiva, la persona que l'editi i el divulgui amb el seu nom, llevat que hi hagi un pacte contrari. 
En el cas d'una interpretació o execució, l'actor, cantant, músic, o qualsevol altra persona que representi, canti, llegeixi, reciti, interpreti o executi de qualsevulla manera una obra. 
En el cas d'un fonograma, el productor fonogràfic, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica sota la iniciativa i responsabilitat de la qual es fa per primera vegada una fixació exclusivament sonora de l'execució d'una obra o d'altres sons. 
En el cas d'un enregistrament audiovisual, el productor de l'enregistrament, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica que tingui la iniciativa i assumeixi la responsabilitat de les fixacions d'un pla o una seqüència d'imatges, amb o sense so. 
En el cas d'una emissió o una transmissió, l'entitat de radiodifusió. 
En el cas d'una mera fotografia, aquella persona que l'hagi realitzada. 
En el cas d'altres objectes protegits per la legislació de la propietat intel·lectual vigent, la persona que aquesta indiqui. 
Es consideraran obres derivades aquelles obres creades a partir de l'objecte d'aquesta llicència com, per exemple, les traduccions i adaptacions; les revisions, actualitzacions i anotacions; els compendis, resums i extractes; els arranjaments musicals, i en general qualsevol transformació d'una obra literària, artística o científica. Per aclarir dubtes, si l'obra consisteix en una composició musical o en un enregistrament de sons, la sincronització temporal de l'obra amb una imatge en moviment (synching) serà considerada com una obra derivada als efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
Tindran la consideració de col·leccions la recopilació d'obres alienes, de dades o d'altres elements independents com ara les antologies i les bases de dades que per la selecció o disposició de llurs continguts constitueixin creacions intel·lectuals. La mera incorporació d'una obra en una col·lecció no donarà lloc a una obra derivada a efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
El llicenciador és la persona o l'entitat que ofereix l'obra o la prestació subjecta als termes d'aquesta llicència i que en concedeix els drets d'explotació conforme al que s'hi disposa. 
Vós sou la persona o l'entitat que exerceix els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència i que prèviament no ha violat els termes d'aquesta llicència respecte a l'obra o la prestació, o que ha rebut un permís exprés del llicenciador per exercir els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència malgrat una violació anterior. 
La transformació d'una obra comprèn la traducció, l'adaptació i qualsevol altra modificació de la qual derivi una obra diferent. La creació resultant de la transformació d'una obra tindrà la consideració d'obra derivada. 
S'entén per reproducció la fixació directa o indirecta, provisional o permanent, per qualsevol mitjà i en qualsevol forma, de tota l'obra o la prestació o de part d'ella, que en permeti la comunicació o l'obtenció de còpies. 
S'entén per distribució el fet de posar a disposició del públic l'original o les còpies de l'obra o la prestació mitjançant la venda, el lloguer, el préstec o qualsevol altre sistema. 
S'entén per comunicació pública qualsevol acte mitjançant el qual una pluralitat de persones, que no pertanyin a l'àmbit domèstic de qui la duu a terme, pot tenir accés a l'obra o la prestació sense que se'ls hagi fet una distribució prèvia d'exemplars. Es considera comunicació pública el fet de posar l'obra o la prestació a disposició del públic per procediments electrònics amb fil o sense fil de manera que qualsevol persona pugui accedir-hi des d'on vulgui i quan vulgui. 
L'explotació de l'obra o la prestació comprèn la reproducció, la distribució, la comunicació pública i, en el seu cas, la transformació. 
Els elements de la llicència són les característiques principals de la llicència segons la selecció efectuada pel llicenciador i indicades en el títol d'aquesta llicència: Reconeixement, CompartirIgual. 
Una llicència equivalent és: 
Una versió posterior d'aquesta llicència de Creative Commons amb els mateixos elements de la llicència. 
La mateixa versió o una versió posterior d'aquesta llicència de qualsevol altra jurisdicció reconeguda per Creative Commons amb els mateixos elements de la llicència (per exemple: Reconeixement-CompartirIgual 3.0 Japó). 
La mateixa versió o una versió posterior de la llicència de Creative Commons no adaptada a cap jurisdicció (Unported) amb els mateixos elements de la llicència. 
Una de les llicències compatibles que apareix a https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses i que ha estat aprovada per Creative Commons com a essencialment equivalent d'aquesta llicència perquè, com a mínim: 
Conté termes amb el mateix propòsit, el mateix significat i el mateix efecte que els elements d'aquesta llicència. 
Permet explícitament que les obres derivades d'obres subjectes a aquella puguin ser distribuïdes mitjançant aquesta llicència, la llicència de Creative Commons no adaptada a cap jurisdicció (Unported) o una llicència de qualsevol altra jurisdicció reconeguda per Creative Commons, amb els mateixos elements de la llicència. 
2. Límits dels drets. No hi ha res en aquesta llicència que pretengui reduir o restringir qualsevol dels límits legals dels drets exclusius del titular dels drets de propietat intel·lectual d'acord amb la Llei de propietat intel·lectual o qualsevol altra normativa aplicable, ja siguin drets derivats d'usos legítims —com ara la còpia privada o la citació— ja siguin altres limitacions —com la que resulta de la primera venda d'exemplars (exhauriment). 
3. Concessió de llicència. Conforme a les condicions d'aquesta llicència, el llicenciador concedeix, pel termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual i a títol gratuït, una llicència d'àmbit mundial no exclusiva que inclou els drets següents: 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació. 
Dret d'incorporar l'obra o la prestació en una o més col·leccions. 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació lícitament incorporada en una col·lecció. 
Dret de transformar l'obra per crear-ne una obra derivada sempre que s'hi inclogui una indicació de la transformació o modificació efectuada. 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament les obres derivades creades a partir de l'obra subjecta a la llicència. 
Dret d'extraure i reutilitzar l'obra o la prestació d'una base de dades. 
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, el titular originari: 
Conserva el dret de percebre les remuneracions o compensacions previstes por actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació, qualificades per la llei com a irrenunciables i inalienables i subjectes a gestió col·lectiva obligatòria. 
Renuncia al dret exclusiu de percebre, tant individualment com mitjançant una entitat de gestió col·lectiva de drets, qualsevol remuneració derivada d'actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació que feu. 
Aquests drets es poden exercir en tots els mitjans i formats, tangibles o intangibles, coneguts en el moment de concessió d'aquesta llicència. Els drets esmentats inclouen el dret a efectuar les modificacions que siguin tècnicament necessàries per exercir els drets en altres mitjans i formats. Tots aquells drets no cedits expressament pel llicenciador queden reservats, incloent-hi, a títol enunciatiu però no limitatiu, els drets morals irrenunciables reconeguts per la llei aplicable. En la mesura que el llicenciador tingui drets exclusius previstos per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea en matèria de dret sui generis sobre bases de dades, renuncia expressament a aquests drets exclusius. 
4. Restriccions. La concessió de drets que implica aquesta llicència està subjecta i limitada a les restriccions següents: 
Podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació només en els termes d'aquesta llicència i n'heu d'incloure una còpia, o l'identificador uniforme de recursos (URI) corresponent. No podeu oferir o imposar cap condició sobre l'obra o la prestació que alteri o restringeixi els termes d'aquesta llicència o l'exercici dels drets per part dels seus concessionaris. No podeu subllicenciar l'obra o la prestació. Heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos referents a aquesta llicència i a l'absència de garanties. No podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació amb mesures tecnològiques que en controlin l'accés o l'ús d'una manera contrària als termes d'aquesta llicència. Aquesta secció 4.a també afecta l'obra o la prestació incorporada en una col·lecció, però no implica que la col·lecció en conjunt automàticament quedi o hagi de quedar subjecta als mateixos termes. En el cas que us sigui requerit, mitjançant una comunicació prèvia del llicenciador, si incorporeu l'obra o la prestació en una col·lecció o en creeu una obra derivada, haureu d'eliminar qualsevol dels crèdits requerits en l'apartat 4.c, fins on sigui possible. 
Podeu distribuir o comunicar públicament una obra derivada, en el sentit d'aquesta llicència, només en els seus termes o mitjançant una llicència equivalent. Si useu aquesta mateixa llicència n'heu d'incloure una còpia o bé l'URI, amb cada obra derivada que distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament. No podeu oferir o imposar cap condició respecte de l'obra derivada que alteri o restringeixi els termes d'aquesta llicència o l'exercici dels drets per part dels seus concessionaris. Quan distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament l'obra derivada, heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos referents a aquesta llicència i a l'absència de garanties. No podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra derivada amb mesures tecnològiques que en controlin l'accés o l'ús d'una manera contrària als termes d'aquesta llicència. Si useu una llicència equivalent haureu de complir-ne els requisits establerts quan distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament l'obra derivada. Totes les condicions d'aquesta secció 4.b també afecten l'obra derivada incorporada en una col·lecció, però no implica que la col·lecció en conjunt automàticament en quedi o n'hagi de quedar subjecta. 
Si reproduïu, distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament l'obra o la prestació, una col·lecció que la incorpori o qualsevol obra derivada, heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos sobre la propietat intel·lectual i indicar, de manera raonable conforme al mitjà o als mitjans que useu: 
El nom de l'autor original, o el pseudònim si és el cas, així com el del titular originari, si s'ha facilitat. 
El nom d'aquelles parts (per exemple: institució, publicació, revista) que el titular originari o el llicenciador designin perquè siguin reconegudes en l'avís legal, les condicions d'ús, o de qualsevol altra manera raonable. 
El títol de l'obra o la prestació si s'ha facilitat. 
L'URI, si n'hi ha, que el llicenciador especifiqui perquè sigui vinculat a l'obra o la prestació, llevat que aquest URI no es refereixi a l'avís legal o a la informació sobre la llicència de l'obra o la prestació. 
En el cas d'una obra derivada, un avís que identifiqui la transformació de l'obra en l'obra derivada (p. ex., «traducció catalana de l'obra de l'autor original», o «guió basat en l'obra original de l'autor original»). 
Aquest reconeixement s'ha de fer de manera raonable. En el cas d'una obra derivada o d'una incorporació en una col·lecció, aquests crèdits hauran d'aparèixer com a mínim en el mateix lloc on hi hagi els corresponents a altres autors o titulars i de forma comparable a aquests. Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, els crèdits requerits en aquesta secció només s'usaran a efectes d'atribució de l'obra o la prestació en la manera especificada anteriorment. Sense un permís previ per escrit, no podeu afirmar ni fer entendre implícitament ni explícitament cap connexió, patrocini o aprovació per part del titular originari, el llicenciador o les parts reconegudes cap a vós o cap l'ús que feu de l'obra o la prestació. 
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, s'ha de fer notar que les restriccions anteriors (paràgrafs 4.a, 4.b i 4.c) no s'aplicaran a les parts de l'obra o la prestació subjecta a aquesta llicència que únicament puguin ser protegides mitjançant el dret sui generis sobre bases de dades recollit per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea de bases de dades. 
5. Exoneració de responsabilitat 
LLEVAT QUE S'ACORDI MÚTUAMENT ENTRE LES PARTS, EL LLICENCIADOR OFEREIX L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ TAL COM ÉS (ON AN AS-IS BASIS) I NO CONFEREIX GARANTIA DE CAP MENA RESPECTE DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ O LA PRESÈNCIA O L'ABSÈNCIA D'ERRORS QUE ES PUGUIN DETECTAR O NO.

7. Finalització de la llicència 
Aquesta llicència i la concessió dels drets que conté acabaran automàticament en cas que se n'incompleixi qualsevol dels termes. No obstant això, no s'anul·larà la llicència d'aquelles persones o entitats que hagin rebut obres derivades o col·leccions vostres amb aquesta llicència, sempre que aquestes persones o entitats es mantinguin en el compliment íntegre d'aquesta llicència. Les seccions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, i 8 continuaran vigents malgrat que finalitzi aquesta llicència. 
Conforme a les condicions anteriors, la concessió de drets d'aquesta llicència és vigent per tot el termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual segons la llei aplicable. Malgrat això, el llicenciador es reserva el dret a divulgar o publicar l'obra o la prestació en condicions diferents a les presents, o a retirar-la en qualsevol moment. Tanmateix, això no suposarà donar per conclosa aquesta llicència (o qualsevol altra llicència que hagi estat concedida, o calgui concedir, en els termes d'aquesta llicència), sinó que continuarà vigent i amb efectes complets, a menys que no hagi finalitzat conforme allò establert anteriorment, sense perjudici del dret moral de penediment en els termes reconeguts per la llei de propietat intel·lectual aplicable. 
8. Miscel·lània 
Cada vegada que exploteu d'alguna manera l'obra o la prestació, o una col·lecció que la incorpori, el llicenciador ofereix als tercers i successius llicenciataris la concessió de drets sobre l'obra o la prestació, en les mateixes condicions que la llicència que us ha estat concedida.

Si alguna disposició d'aquesta llicència resulta invàlida o inaplicable segons la llei vigent, això no afectarà la validesa o l'aplicabilitat de la resta dels termes d'aquesta llicència i, sense cap acció addicional per a qualsevol de les parts d'aquest acord, aquesta disposició s'entendrà reformada en allò estrictament necessari per fer que aquesta disposició sigui vàlida i executiva. 
No s'entendrà que hi ha renúncia pel que fa a algun terme o disposició d'aquesta llicència, ni que se'n consent cap violació, llevat que la renúncia o el consentiment figuri per escrit i estigui firmat per la part que renuncia o que consent. 
Aquesta llicència constitueix l'acord ple entre les parts respecte de l'obra o la prestació objecte d'aquesta llicència. No hi ha interpretacions, acords o condicions respecte de l'obra o la prestació que no s'especifiquin expressament en aquesta llicència. El llicenciador no estarà obligat per cap disposició complementària que pugui aparèixer en qualsevol comunicació vostra. Aquesta llicència no es pot modificar sense que ho acordeu per escrit amb el llicenciador. 
Avís de Creative Commons 
Creative Commons no és part d'aquesta llicència, i no ofereix cap garantia en relació amb l'obra o la prestació. Creative Commons no serà responsable davant vostre —o davant cap part—, ni per cap dany de cap tipus, tant si és general o especial (incloent-hi el dany emergent i el lucre cessant), com si és fortuït o causal, que estigui relacionat amb aquesta llicència. A pesar de les dues (2) afirmacions anteriors, si Creative Commons s'identifica expressament com a llicenciador, tindrà tots els drets i les obligacions del llicenciador. 
Llevat del propòsit limitat d'indicar al públic que l'obra o la prestació està subjecta a una llicència CCPL, cap part usarà la marca registrada Creative Commons ni cap altra marca registrada o insígnia relacionada amb Creative Commons sense el seu consentiment per escrit.

QUEDA PROHIBIDO CUALQUIER USO DE LA OBRA O PRESTACIÓN DIFERENTE A LO AUTORIZADO BAJO ESTA LICENCIA O LO DISPUESTO EN LA LEY DE PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL. 
MEDIANTE EL EJERCICIO DE CUALQUIER DERECHO SOBRE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN, USTED ACEPTA Y CONSIENTE LAS LIMITACIONES Y OBLIGACIONES DE ESTA LICENCIA, SIN PERJUICIO DE LA NECESIDAD DE CONSENTIMIENTO EXPRESO EN CASO DE VIOLACIÓN PREVIA DE LOS TÉRMINOS DE LA MISMA.

1. Definiciones 
La obra es la creación literaria, artística o científica ofrecida bajo los términos de esta licencia. 
En esta licencia se considera una prestación cualquier interpretación, ejecución, fonograma, grabación audiovisual, emisión o transmisión, mera fotografía u otros objetos protegidos por la legislación de propiedad intelectual vigente aplicable. 
La aplicación de esta licencia a una colección (definida más adelante) afectará únicamente a su estructura en cuanto forma de expresión de la selección o disposición de sus contenidos, no siendo extensiva a éstos. En este caso la colección tendrá la consideración de obra a efectos de esta licencia. 
El titular originario es: 
En el caso de una obra literaria, artística o científica, la persona natural o grupo de personas que creó la obra. 
En el caso de una obra colectiva, la persona que la edite y divulgue bajo su nombre, salvo pacto contrario. 
En el caso de una interpretación o ejecución, el actor, cantante, músico, o cualquier otra persona que represente, cante, lea, recite, interprete o ejecute en cualquier forma una obra. 
En el caso de un fonograma, el productor fonográfico, es decir, la persona natural o jurídica bajo cuya iniciativa y responsabilidad se realiza por primera vez una fijación exclusivamente sonora de la ejecución de una obra o de otros sonidos. 
En el caso de una grabación audiovisual, el productor de la grabación, es decir, la persona natural o jurídica que tenga la iniciativa y asuma la responsabilidad de las fijaciones de un plano o secuencia de imágenes, con o sin sonido. 
En el caso de una emisión o una transmisión, la entidad de radiodifusión. 
En el caso de una mera fotografía, aquella persona que la haya realizado. 
En el caso de otros objetos protegidos por la legislación de propiedad intelectual vigente, la persona que ésta señale. 
Se considerarán obras derivadas aquellas obras creadas a partir de la licenciada, como por ejemplo: las traducciones y adaptaciones; las revisiones, actualizaciones y anotaciones; los compendios, resúmenes y extractos; los arreglos musicales y, en general, cualesquiera transformaciones de una obra literaria, artística o científica. Para evitar la duda, si la obra consiste en una composición musical o grabación de sonidos, la sincronización temporal de la obra con una imagen en movimiento (synching) será considerada como una obra derivada a efectos de esta licencia. 
Tendrán la consideración de colecciones la recopilación de obras ajenas, de datos o de otros elementos independientes como las antologías y las bases de datos que por la selección o disposición de sus contenidos constituyan creaciones intelectuales. La mera incorporación de una obra en una colección no dará lugar a una derivada a efectos de esta licencia. 
El licenciador es la persona o la entidad que ofrece la obra o prestación bajo los términos de esta licencia y le concede los derechos de explotación de la misma conforme a lo dispuesto en ella. 
Usted es la persona o la entidad que ejercita los derechos concedidos mediante esta licencia y que no ha violado previamente los términos de la misma con respecto a la obra o la prestación, o que ha recibido el permiso expreso del licenciador de ejercitar los derechos concedidos mediante esta licencia a pesar de una violación anterior. 
La transformación de una obra comprende su traducción, adaptación y cualquier otra modificación en su forma de la que se derive una obra diferente. La creación resultante de la transformación de una obra tendrá la consideración de obra derivada. 
Se entiende por reproducción la fijación directa o indirecta, provisional o permanente, por cualquier medio y en cualquier forma, de toda la obra o la prestación o de parte de ella, que permita su comunicación o la obtención de copias. 
Se entiende por distribución la puesta a disposición del público del original o de las copias de la obra o la prestación, en un soporte tangible, mediante su venta, alquiler, préstamo o de cualquier otra forma. 
Se entiende por comunicación pública todo acto por el cual una pluralidad de personas, que no pertenezcan al ámbito doméstico de quien la lleva a cabo, pueda tener acceso a la obra o la prestación sin previa distribución de ejemplares a cada una de ellas. Se considera comunicación pública la puesta a disposición del público de obras o prestaciones por procedimientos alámbricos o inalámbricos, de tal forma que cualquier persona pueda acceder a ellas desde el lugar y en el momento que elija. 
La explotación de la obra o la prestación comprende la reproducción, la distribución, la comunicación pública y, en su caso, la transformación. 
Los elementos de la licencia son las características principales de la licencia según la selección efectuada por el licenciador e indicadas en el título de esta licencia: Reconocimiento, CompartirIgual.

Permite explícitamente que las obras derivadas de obras sujetas a ella puedan ser distribuidas mediante esta licencia, la licencia de Creative Commons no adaptada a ninguna jurisdicción (Unported) o una licencia de cualquier otra jurisdicción reconocida por Creative Commons, con sus mismos elementos de licencia. 
2. Límites de los derechos. Nada en esta licencia pretende reducir o restringir cualesquiera límites legales de los derechos exclusivos del titular de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de acuerdo con la Ley de propiedad intelectual o cualesquiera otras leyes aplicables, ya sean derivados de usos legítimos, tales como la copia privada o la cita, u otras limitaciones como la resultante de la primera venta de ejemplares (agotamiento). 
3. Concesión de licencia. Conforme a los términos y a las condiciones de esta licencia, el licenciador concede, por el plazo de protección de los derechos de propiedad intelectual y a título gratuito, una licencia de ámbito mundial no exclusiva que incluye los derechos siguientes:

Derecho a extraer y reutilizar la obra o la prestación de una base de datos. 
Para evitar cualquier duda, el titular originario: 
Conserva el derecho a percibir las remuneraciones o compensaciones previstas por actos de explotación de la obra o prestación, calificadas por la ley como irrenunciables e inalienables y sujetas a gestión colectiva obligatoria. 
Renuncia al derecho exclusivo a percibir, tanto individualmente como mediante una entidad de gestión colectiva de derechos, cualquier remuneración derivada de actos de explotación de la obra o prestación que usted realice. 
Estos derechos se pueden ejercitar en todos los medios y formatos, tangibles o intangibles, conocidos en el momento de la concesión de esta licencia. Los derechos mencionados incluyen el derecho a efectuar las modificaciones que sean precisas técnicamente para el ejercicio de los derechos en otros medios y formatos. Todos los derechos no concedidos expresamente por el licenciador quedan reservados, incluyendo, a título enunciativo pero no limitativo, los derechos morales irrenunciables reconocidos por la ley aplicable. En la medida en que el licenciador ostente derechos exclusivos previstos por la ley nacional vigente que implementa la directiva europea en materia de derecho sui generis sobre bases de datos, renuncia expresamente a dichos derechos exclusivos. 
4. Restricciones. La concesión de derechos que supone esta licencia se encuentra sujeta y limitada a las restricciones siguientes: 
Usted puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra o prestación solamente bajo los términos de esta licencia y debe incluir una copia de la misma, o su Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI). Usted no puede ofrecer o imponer ninguna condición sobre la obra o prestación que altere o restrinja los términos de esta licencia o el ejercicio de sus derechos por parte de los concesionarios de la misma. Usted no puede sublicenciar la obra o prestación. Usted debe mantener intactos todos los avisos que se refieran a esta licencia y a la ausencia de garantías. Usted no puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra o prestación con medidas tecnológicas que controlen el acceso o el uso de una manera contraria a los términos de esta licencia. Esta sección 4.a también afecta a la obra o prestación incorporada en una colección, pero ello no implica que ésta en su conjunto quede automáticamente o deba quedar sujeta a los términos de la misma. En el caso que le sea requerido, previa comunicación del licenciador, si usted incorpora la obra en una colección y/o crea una obra derivada, deberá quitar cualquier crédito requerido en el apartado 4.c, en la medida de lo posible. 
Usted puede distribuir o comunicar públicamente una obra derivada en el sentido de esta licencia solamente bajo los términos de la misma u otra licencia equivalente. Si usted utiliza esta misma licencia debe incluir una copia o bien su URI, con cada obra derivada que usted distribuya o comunique públicamente. Usted no puede ofrecer o imponer ningún término respecto a la obra derivada que altere o restrinja los términos de esta licencia o el ejercicio de sus derechos por parte de los concesionarios de la misma. Usted debe mantener intactos todos los avisos que se refieran a esta licencia y a la ausencia de garantías cuando distribuya o comunique públicamente la obra derivada. Usted no puede ofrecer o imponer ningún término respecto de las obras derivadas o sus transformaciones que alteren o restrinjan los términos de esta licencia o el ejercicio de sus derechos por parte de los concesionarios de la misma. Usted no puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra derivada con medidas tecnológicas que controlen el acceso o uso de la obra de una manera contraria a los términos de esta licencia. Si utiliza una licencia equivalente debe cumplir con los requisitos que ésta establezca cuando distribuya o comunique públicamente la obra derivada. Todas estas condiciones se aplican a una obra derivada en tanto que incorporada a una colección, pero no implica que ésta tenga que estar sujeta a los términos de esta licencia. 
Si usted reproduce, distribuye o comunica públicamente la obra o la prestación, una colección que la incorpore o cualquier obra derivada, debe mantener intactos todos los avisos sobre la propiedad intelectual e indicar, de manera razonable conforme al medio o a los medios que usted esté utilizando: 
El nombre del autor original, o el seudónimo si es el caso, así como el del titular originario, si le es facilitado. 
El nombre de aquellas partes (por ejemplo: institución, publicación, revista) que el titular originario y/o el licenciador designen para ser reconocidos en el aviso legal, las condiciones de uso, o de cualquier otra manera razonable. 
El título de la obra o la prestación si le es facilitado. 
El URI, si existe, que el licenciador especifique para ser vinculado a la obra o la prestación, a menos que tal URI no se refiera al aviso legal o a la información sobre la licencia de la obra o la prestación. 
En el caso de una obra derivada, un aviso que identifique la transformación de la obra en la obra derivada (p. ej., "traducción castellana de la obra de Autor Original," o "guión basado en obra original de Autor Original"). 
Este reconocimiento debe hacerse de manera razonable. En el caso de una obra derivada o incorporación en una colección estos créditos deberán aparecer como mínimo en el mismo lugar donde se hallen los correspondientes a otros autores o titulares y de forma comparable a los mismos. Para evitar la duda, los créditos requeridos en esta sección sólo serán utilizados a efectos de atribución de la obra o la prestación en la manera especificada anteriormente. Sin un permiso previo por escrito, usted no puede afirmar ni dar a entender implícitamente ni explícitamente ninguna conexión, patrocinio o aprobación por parte del titular originario, el licenciador y/o las partes reconocidas hacia usted o hacia el uso que hace de la obra o la prestación. 
Para evitar cualquier duda, debe hacerse notar que las restricciones anteriores (párrafos 4.a, 4.b y 4.c) no son de aplicación a aquellas partes de la obra o la prestación objeto de esta licencia que únicamente puedan ser protegidas mediante el derecho sui generis sobre bases de datos recogido por la ley nacional vigente implementando la directiva europea de bases de datos 
5. Exoneración de responsabilidad 
A MENOS QUE SE ACUERDE MUTUAMENTE ENTRE LAS PARTES, EL LICENCIADOR OFRECE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN TAL CUAL (ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS) Y NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA DE CUALQUIER TIPO RESPECTO DE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN O DE LA PRESENCIA O AUSENCIA DE ERRORES QUE PUEDAN O NO SER DESCUBIERTOS. ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE TALES GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PUEDE NO SER DE APLICACIÓN A USTED. 
6. Limitación de responsabilidad. SALVO QUE LO DISPONGA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE LA LEY APLICABLE, EN NINGÚN CASO EL LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSABLE ANTE USTED POR CUALESQUIERA DAÑOS RESULTANTES, GENERALES O ESPECIALES (INCLUIDO EL DAÑO EMERGENTE Y EL LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUITOS O CAUSALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENCIA O EL USO DE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN, INCLUSO SI EL LICENCIADOR HUBIERA SIDO INFORMADO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE TALES DAÑOS. 
7. Finalización de la licencia 
Esta licencia y la concesión de los derechos que contiene terminarán automáticamente en caso de cualquier incumplimiento de los términos de la misma. Las personas o entidades que hayan recibido de usted obras derivadas o colecciones bajo esta licencia, sin embargo, no verán sus licencias finalizadas, siempre que tales personas o entidades se mantengan en el cumplimiento íntegro de esta licencia. Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 permanecerán vigentes pese a cualquier finalización de esta licencia. 
Conforme a las condiciones y términos anteriores, la concesión de derechos de esta licencia es vigente por todo el plazo de protección de los derechos de propiedad intelectual según la ley aplicable. A pesar de lo anterior, el licenciador se reserva el derecho a divulgar o publicar la obra o la prestación en condiciones distintas a las presentes, o de retirar la obra o la prestación en cualquier momento. No obstante, ello no supondrá dar por concluida esta licencia (o cualquier otra licencia que haya sido concedida, o sea necesario ser concedida, bajo los términos de esta licencia), que continuará vigente y con efectos completos a no ser que haya finalizado conforme a lo establecido anteriormente, sin perjuicio del derecho moral de arrepentimiento en los términos reconocidos por la ley de propiedad intelectual aplicable. 
8. Miscelánea 
Cada vez que usted realice cualquier tipo de explotación de la obra o la prestación, o de una colección que la incorpore, el licenciador ofrece a los terceros y sucesivos licenciatarios la concesión de derechos sobre la obra o la prestación en las mismas condiciones y términos que la licencia concedida a usted. 
Cada vez que usted realice cualquier tipo de explotación de una obra derivada, el licenciador ofrece a los terceros y sucesivos licenciatarios la concesión de derechos sobre la obra objeto de esta licencia en las mismas condiciones y términos que la licencia concedida a usted.

No se entenderá que existe renuncia respecto de algún término o disposición de esta licencia, ni que se consiente violación alguna de la misma, a menos que tal renuncia o consentimiento figure por escrito y lleve la firma de la parte que renuncie o consienta. 
Esta licencia constituye el acuerdo pleno entre las partes con respecto a la obra o la prestación objeto de la licencia. No caben interpretaciones, acuerdos o condiciones con respecto a la obra o la prestación que no se encuentren expresamente especificados en la presente licencia. El licenciador no estará obligado por ninguna disposición complementaria que pueda aparecer en cualquier comunicación que le haga llegar usted.

DEBEKATURIK DAGO LAN EDO PRESTAZIO HAU ERABILTZEA BAIMEN HONETAN ONETSITAKOAZ EDOTA JABETZA INTELEKTUALAREN LEGEETAN XEDATUTAKOAZ KANPOKO BESTE EZERTARAKO.

BAIMENDUNAK BAIMEN HONEN MENDE DIREN ESKUBIDEAK LAGATZEN DIZKIZU, ZUK BALDINTZA ETA BETEBEHAR HAUEK ONARTZEN BADITUZU.
1. Definizioak
Lana da baimen honen baldintzapean eskaintzen den literatur, arte edo zientzia sorkaria.
Baimen honetan prestaziotzat jotzen da edozein interpretazio, joaldi, fonograma, ikus-entzunezko grabazio, emanaldi, transmisio, argazki edota jabetza intelektualaren legeak babestutako beste edozein objektu.
Baimen hau bilduma batean (aurrerago dago definizioa) ezartzean denean, edukien antolaera edo hautapena adierazteko eraren egiturari eragingo dio, baina ez die edukiei eragingo. Halakoetan, bilduma hartuko da lantzat baimen honen ondorioetarako.
Jatorrizko jabea da:
literatur, arte edo zientzia sorkarien kasuan, lana sortu zuen gizabanakoa edo pertsona multzoa.
lan kolektiboen kasuan, bere izenpean editatu eta hedatzen duen pertsona, besterik ituntzen ez bada.
interpretazio edo joaldi baten kasuan, antzezlaria, musikaria edo obra bat edozein eratan antzeztu, abestu, irakurri, interpretatu edo jotzen duen pertsona.
fonograma baten kasuan, ekoizle fonografikoa, hau da, lan baten edo era guztietako hotsen joaldi baten finkatze soilik soinuduna lehen aldiz egiteko ekimena eta erantzukizuna hartu duen pertsona natural edo juridikoa.
ikus-entzunezko grabazioen kasuan, grabazioaren ekoizlea, hau da, plano bat edo irudi sekuentzia bat, soinuaz edo soinurik gabe, finkatzeko ekimena eta erantzukizuna hartu duen pertsona natural edo juridikoa.
emanaldi edo transmisioen kasuan, irrati emailea.
argazki hutsen kasuan, egilea den pertsona.
jabetza intelektualaren legeak babestutako beste edozein objekturen kasuan, legeak xedatzen duen pertsona.
Lan eratorritzat joko dira lan baimendunetik abiatuta sortutakoak, besteak beste: itzulpenak eta egokitzapenak; berrikuspenak, eguneratzeak eta oharpenak; bildumak, laburpenak eta aterakinak; musika moldaketak eta, orobat, literatur, arte edo zientzia lan baten eraldaketa oro. Zalantzarik egon ez dadin, lana baldin bada musika konposizioa eta soinu grabaketa, lan hori mugimenduzko irudiekin denboraz sinkronizatzea lan eratorritzat joko da baimen honen ondorioetarako.
Bildumatzat hartuko dira besteren lanen bildumak, datuzkoak edo bestelako elementu lokabezkoak, hala nola antologiak edota datu baseak, edukien hautapenagatik edo antolaeragatik sorkari intelektualak baldin badira. Lan bat bilduma baten barruan sartze hutsak ez du lan eratorririk sortuko baimen honen.
Baimenduna da lana edo prestazioa baimen honen baldintzapean eskaintzen duen pertsona edo erakundea, eta ustiapen-eskubideak lagatzen dituena hemen xedatutakoaren arabera.
Zu zara baimen honen bitartez lagatako eskubideak erabiltzen dituen pertsona edo erakundea eta aurrez lanari edo prestazioari buruz baimenaren baldintzak urratu ez dituena, edota baimendunaren berariazko onespena jaso duena baimen honen bitartez lagatako eskubideak erabiltzeko, nahiz aurretik urraketa egina izan.
Lanaren eraldatzea da itzultzea, egokitzea edota forma beste edonola aldatzea, nondik sortzen baita beste lan berri bat. Lan baten eraldaketa bidez gauzatzen den sorkaria lan eratorritzat joko da.
Erreprodukziotzat hartuko da lana edo prestazioa hedatzeko edo kopiak egiteko aukera ematen duen euskarri batean zuzenean nahiz zeharka finkatzea, behin-behin-behinekoz edo betirako, edozein bitarteko edo formatan delarik ere.
Banaketatzat hartzen da jendearen eskura jartzea lanaren edo prestazioaren jatorrizkoa nahiz kopiak, euskarri ukigai batean, salmenta, alokatze, mailegu edo beste edozein bidez.
Jendaurreko hedapentzat hartuko dira lana edo prestazioa jendaurrean, hedapena egiten duen pertsonaren etxekoen aurrean ez bada erakusteko egintza guztiak, pertsona bakoitzari lanaren edo prestazioaren ale bana aurrez eman behar izanik gabe. Jendaurreko hedapentzat joko da lana edo prestazioa jendearen eskura ipintzea bitarteko haridun nahiz hari gabekoen bidez, eta horren barnean izango da lana jendearen esku jartzea, jendeak nahi duen lekutik eta nahi duenean eskuratzeko moduan.
Lana edo prestazioa ustiatzea da erreproduzitzea, banatzea, jendaurrean hedatzea eta eraldatzea.

Haien mende diren lanetatik eratorritako lanak berariaz baimentzen ditu baimen honen edota Creative Commons-en lege testua eskumen jakin batera egokitu gabekoa (Unported) eta Creative Commons-ek onartutako edozein eskumenek emandako baimen osagai berberak dituenaren bitartez hedatuak izan daitezen.
2. Eskubideen mugak. Baimen honetan ez dira ezertan mugatu edo gutxitu nahi jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen jabeak, Jabetza Intelektualaren Legearen arabera edota aplikagarri den beste edozein legeren arabera, bereak baino ez dituen eskubideen legezko mugak, berdin dio muga horiek erabilera zilegien ondorio izan, adibidez kopia pribatuaren eskubidearena edo aipamen eskubidearena, edo bestelako mugakizunen ondorio izan, hala nola aleen lehen salmentarena (agortzea).
3. Baimen ematea. Baimen honetan adierazten diren betebehar eta baldintzen arabera, baimendunak mundu osoaren esparruko baimen ez esklusiboa ematen du, jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen indarraldi osorako eta trukean ordainsari gabe, eskubide hauen lagapena eginez:
Lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzeko eskubidea.
Lana edo prestazioa bilduma batean nahiz gehiagotan txertatzeko eskubidea.
Baimen batean legez txertatutako lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzeko eskubidea.
Lana eraldatzeko eskubidea lan eratorri bat sortzeko, betiere lan eratorrian azaltzen baldin bada egindako eraldaketa edo aldaketaren berri.
Baimendutako lanetik abiatuta sortuako lan eratorriak erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzeko eskubidea.
Lana edo prestazioa datu base batetik erauzi eta berrerabitzeki eskubidea
Zalantzarik egon ez dadin, jatorrizko jabeak:
lana edo prestazioa ustiatzeko ekintzen truke dagozkion ordainsariak edo kalte-ordainak jasotzeko eskubidea gordetzeko du, legeak lagaezintzat eta besterenezintzat jotzen dituen guztietan, eta nahitaezko kudeaketa kolektiboaren mende daudenetan.
uko egiten dio lanaz edo prestazioaz zuk egiten dituzun ustiapen ekintzen truke inolako ordainsaririk jasotzeko bakarreko eskubideari, nahiz bakarka, nahiz eskubideen kudeatze kolektiboko entitateen bitartez.
Adierazitako eskubide horiek bitarteko eta formatu guztien bidez erabil daitezke, ukigarriak nahiz ukiezinak izan, baimen hau ematerakoan ezagun direnen arabera. Aipatutako eskubide horien barruan dago behar diren aldaketa teknikoak egiteko eskubidea, beste bitarteko eta formatuetan erabili ahal izateko eskubideok. Baimendunak berariaz lagatzen ez dituen eskubide guztiak erreserbatu egiten dira, barne direla, azalpen gisara baina ez hartara mugatuta, legeetan aitortutako eskubide moral lagaezinak. Datu baseen gaineki sui generis eskubideei buruzko Europako arteztaraua gauzatzen duen lege nazionalaren arabera, bakarreko eskubideak badagozkio baimendunari, uko egiten eskubide horiei.
4. Murrizketak. Baimen honek ematen duen eskubide-lagapena murrizketa hauen mende dago mugatua:
Baimen honen baldintzen pean soilik erreproduzitu, banatu edo jendaurrean hedatu dezakezu lana edo prestazioa, eta baimenaren kopia edota URIa (Uniform Resource Identifier) erantsi behar diozu. Ezin duzu lanaren edo prestazioaren gainean baldintzarik eskani edo ezarri, baimen honetako baldintzak edot lagapen-hartzaileen eskubide erabilera ezertan aldatu edo murrizten baditu. Ezin duzu lana edo prestazioa birbaimendu. Oso-osorik gorde behar dituzu baimen honi buruzko eta berme ezari buruzko ohar guztiak. Ezin duzu lana edo prestazioa erreproduzitu, banatu edo jendaurrean hedatu lanaren eskuratzea edo erabilera baimen honetako baldintzen aurka kontrolatzen duten bitarteko teknologikoez. Bilduma batean txertatutako lanari edo prestazioari ere eragiten dio 4.a atal honek, baina horrek ez du esan nahi bilduma osorik baimen honen mende gelditzen edo gelditu behar besterik gabe. Eskatzen bazaizu, baimendunak hala adierazita, lana edo prestazioa bilduma batean txertatzen baduzu edota lan eratorri bat sortzen baduzu, kendu beharko dituzu 4.c paragrafoan eskatzen diren kredituak, ahal duzun neurrian.
Lan eratorri bat banatu edo jendaurrean hedatu dezakezu, baimen honen ildoan, soil-soilik baimen honen edota bere baliokideren baten pean. Baimen hau bera erabiltzen baduzu, kopia bat edo bere URIa sartu behar duzu, banatzen edo jendaurrean hedatzen duzun lan eratorri bakoitzarekin batera. Ezin duzu lan eratorriaren gainean baldintzarik eskaini edo ezarri, baimen honetako baldintzak edota lagapen-hartzaileen eskubide erabilera ezertan aldatu edo murrizten baditu. Oso-osorik gorde behar dituzu baimen honi buruzko eta berme ezari buruzko ohar guztiak, lan eratorria banatu edo jendaurrean hedatzen duzunean. Ezin duzu lan eratorrien edo eraldatuen gainean baldintzarik eskaini edo ezarri, baimen honetako baldintzak edota lagapen-hartzaileen eskubide erabilera ezertan aldatu edo murrizten baditu. Ezin duzu lan eratorria erreproduzitu, banatu edo jendaurrean hedatu lanaren eskuratzea edo erabilera baimen honetako baldintzen aurka kontrolatzen duten bitarteko teknologikoez. Baimen baliokide bat erabiltzen baduzu, haren baldintzak bete behar dituzu lan eratorria banatu edo jendaurrean hedatzen duzunean. Baldintza horiek guztiak lan eratorri bati aplikatzen zaizkio bilduma baten parte den heinean, baina horrek ez du esan nahi bilduma baimen honen mende gelditu behar denik.
Lana edo prestazioa, nahiz hura jasotzen duen bilduma bat edo eratorriako lanen bat erreproduzitu, banatu eta jendaurrean hedatzen baduzu, ukitu gabe gorde behar dituzu jabetza intelektuari buruzko ohar guztiak, eta erabitzen ari zaren bitartekoen arabera, arrazoizko eran adierazi:
jatorrizko egilearen izena, edo goitizen behar bada, baita jatorrizko jabearena ere, horren berri ematen badizute;
jatorrizko jabeak edo baimendunak lege-oharrean, erabilera baldintzetan edota beste arrazoizko atalen batean jaso beharrekotzat izendatzen dituzten aldeen izenak (adibidez: erakundea, argitalpena, aldizkaria);
lanaren edo prestazioaren izenburua, horren berri ematen badizute;
baimendunak zehaztutakoaren arabera, lanari edo prestazioari estekatzeko URIa, non eta URI horrek ez duen zer ikusirik lege-oharrarekin edo lanaren edo prestazioaren baimen argibideekin;
lan eratorrian kasuan, lanak izandako eraldaketa zehazten duen oharra (adibidez, «Jatorrizko Egilearen lana euskaratuta» edo «Jatorrizko Egilearen lanean oinarritutako gidoia»).
Aitorpen hori zentzuzko eran egin behar da. Lan eratorrietan edo bilduma batean txertatua denean, aitorpena agertu behar da, gutxienik, beste egile edo jabeen aipamenak ageri diren leku berean eta era berdintsuan. Zalantzarik ez izateko, atal honetan eskatzen diren kredituak erabili behar dira, soil-solik, lanaren edo prestazioaren aitorpena egiteko, arestian zehaztutako eran. Aldez aurretik idatzko baimena izan ezik, zuk ezin duzu baieztatu edo era inplizitu nahiz esplizituan aditzera eman jatorrizko jabearekiko, baimendunarekiko edota aitortutako aldeekiko inolako lotura, babes edo onarpenik duzunik, ez zuk, ez lanaz edo prestazioaz egiten duzun erabilerak.
Zalantzarik ez izateko, nabarmendu behar da aurreko murrizketak (4.a, 4.b eta 4.c atalak) ez zaizkiela aplikatzen datu basen gaineko sui generis eskubideei buruzko Europako arteztaraua gauzatzen duen lege nazionalaren indarrez baskarrik babes daitezkeen lanaren edo prestazioaren zatiei.
5. Erantzukizunei uko egitea
BAIMENDUNAK LANA EDO PRESTAZIOA DAGOEN-DAGOEN ESKAINTZEN DU, ALDEEK BESTERIK ELKAR HARTZEN EZ DUTEN BITARTEAN, ETA EZ DU INOLAKO BERMERIK EMATEN LANARI EDO PRESTAZIOARI BURUZ EDOTA BERTAN EGON DAITEZKEEN AKATSEZ, ATZEMANAK IZAN EDO EZ. JURISDIKZIO BATZUETAN EZIN DIRA BERME HORIEK SALBUETSI, ETA AGIAN SALBUESPEN HORI EZ DA ZURETZAT APLIKAGARRI IZANGO.
6. Erantzukizuna mugatzea.
APLIKATZEKOA DEN LEGEAK BERARIAZ ETA AGINDUZ HALA XEDATZEN EZ BADU, BAIMENDUNA EZ DA ZUREKIKO ERANTZULE IZANGO SORTUTAKO KALTEENGATIK, DIRELA OROKORRAK, DIRELA BEREZIAK (BARNE DIRA SORTUTAKO KALTEAK ETA ESKURATU GABEKO IRABAZIAK), HALABEHARREZKOAK ZEIN USTEKABEKOAK, ZUZENEKOAK NAHIZ ZEHARKAKOAK, BAIMEN HONI EDO LANAREN EDO PRESTAZIOAREN ERABILERARI LOTURIK SORTUTAKOAK, ARE BAIMENDUNARI KALTE HORIEN AUKERAREN BERRI EMANA BALDIN BAZAIO ERE.
7. Baimen amaiera
Baimen hau eta beraren ondorioz lagatako eskubideak beste gabe amaituko dira baimenaren baldintza guztiak betetzen ez badira. Baimen honen mende zuregandik lan eratorriak edo bildumak jaso dituzten pertsonen edo erakundeen baimenak, ordea, ez dira amaituko pertsona edo erakunde horiek baimen honen baldintza guztiak betetzen jarraitzen badute. Baimen honetako 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 eta 8. atalek indarrean jarraituko dute baimen honen indarraldia amaitu arren.
Aurreko baldintza eta betebeharren arabera, baimen honen eskubide-lagapena jabetza intelektualaren eskubideen indarraldi osorako da, legeen arabera. Aurrekoa hala izanik ere, baimendunak beretzat gordetzen du lana beste baldintza batzuetan hedatu edo argitaratzeko eskubidea, eta noiznahi aldaratzekoa. Nolanahi den ere, horrek ez du baimen hau amaitutzat harraraziko (ez eta baimen honen baldintzapean emandako edo eman beharreko beste baimenik ere), indarrean jarraituko baitu ondorio guztietarako, aurrez xedatutakoaren arabera amaitzen den arte, jabetza intelektualaren legeak aitortzen duen damuaren eskubide morala baztertu gabe.
8. Orotarikoa
Zuk lana edo prestazioa, edota hura erantsita duen bilduma bat, ustiatzen duzun bakoitzean, jatorrizko baimendunak hirugarren eta hurrengo baimen hartzaileei eskaintzen die lanaren edo prestazioaren gaineko eskubide-lagapena, zuri emandako baimenaren betebehar eta baldintza berberetan.
Zuk lan eratorria nolabait ustiatzen duzun bakoitzean, jatorrizko baimendunak hirugarren eta hurrengo baimen hartzaileei eskaintzen die jatorrizko lanaren edo prestazioaren gaineko eskubide-lagapena, zuri emandako baimenaren betebehar eta baldintza berberetan.
Baimen honetan jasotako xedapenen bat baliogabea edo aplikaezina baldin bada legearen arabera, horrek ez dio eragingo baimen honetako gainerako baldintzen balioari edo aplikagarritasunari, eta hitzarmen honen aldeek beste ezer egin behar izanik gabe, xedapen hori ezinbestekoa den neurrian birmoldatutzat joko da baliozkoa eta betebeharrekoa izan dadin.
Ez da onartuko baimen honen xedapen edo baldintzaren bati uko egiterik, edo hura urratzeko onespenik, uko egite hori edo urratze-onespen hori ez badago idatziz emana, eta uko egiten duen edo onesten duen aldeak izenpetua.
Baimen hau aldeen orobateko hitzarmena da, baimenaren gai den lanari edo prestazioari dagokionez. Ez dago lanaren edo prestazioaren gaineko interpretaziorik, adostasunik edo baldintzarik ezartzerik, ez badaude baimen honetan berariaz zehaztuta. Baimenduna ez da zuk berari bidalitako jakinarazpenetan ager daitezkeen xedapen osagarrien mende egongo. Baimen hau ezin da aldatu baimendunaren eta zure arteko adostasun idatziaz ez bada.
Creative Commons-en oharra
Creative Commons ez da baimen honen partaide eta ez du inolako bermerik eskaintzen lanari edo prestazioari buruz. Creative Commons ez da zurekiko nahiz besterekiko erantzule izango, edozein teoria legalen arabera, sortutako kalteengatik, barne direlarik, baina ez bakarrik, kalte orokor zein bereziak (barne dira sortutako kalteak eta eskuratu gabeko irabaziak), halabeharrezkoak zein ustekabekoak, baimen honi loturik sortutakoak. Aurreko bi (2) perpausetan adierazitakoa hala izanik ere, Creative Commons berariazko baimendun gisa identifikatua baldin bada, baimendunaren eskubide eta betebehar guztiak izango ditu.
Lana edo prestazioa Creative Commons-en baimen publikoaren mende baimenduta dagoela jendeari adierazteko xede mugatuaz gain, inork ez du erabiliko «Creative Commons» marka erregistraturik, edo «Creative Commons»-ekin lotutako beste marka erregistratu edo ezaugarririk, hark berariaz onespenik eman gabe. Baimendutako erabilera guztiak «Creative Commons» marka erregistratua erabiltzeko une bakoitzean indarrean diren jarraibideen arabera egingo dira, haren webgunean argitaratu edo aurrez eskaturik ematen diren neurrian. Zalantzarik ez izateko, marka erabiltzeko murrisketa horiek ez dira baimenaren zati.

1. Definicións
A obra é a creación literaria, artística ou científica ofrecida nos termos desta licenza.
Nesta licenza considérase unha prestación calquera interpretación, execución, fonograma, gravación audiovisual, emisión ou transmisión, simple fotografía ou outros obxectos protexidos pola lexislación de propiedade intelectual vixente aplicábel.
A aplicación desta licenza a unha colección (definida máis adiante) afectaralle unicamente á súa estrutura en canto forma de expresión da selección ou disposición dos seus contidos, mais non é extensiva a estes. Neste caso a colección terá a consideración de obra para os efectos desta licenza.
O titular orixinario é:
No caso dunha obra literaria, artística ou científica, a persoa natural ou grupo de persoas que creou a obra.
No caso dunha obra colectiva, a persoa que a edite e divulgue baixo o seu nome, salvo pacto contrario.
No caso dunha interpretación ou execución, o actor, cantante, músico, ou calquera outra persoa que represente, cante, lea, recite, interprete ou execute de calquera forma unha obra.
No caso dun fonograma, o produtor fonográfico, é dicir, a persoa natural ou xurídica baixo a iniciativa e responsabilidade da cal se realiza por primeira vez unha fixación exclusivamente sonora da execución dunha obra ou doutros sons.
No caso dunha gravación audiovisual, o produtor da gravación, é dicir, a persoa natural ou xurídica que teña a iniciativa e asuma a responsabilidade das fixacións dun plano ou secuencia de imaxes, con ou sen son.
No caso dunha emisión ou dunha transmisión, a entidade de radiodifusión.
No caso dunha simple fotografía, aquela persoa que a realizou.
No caso doutros obxectos protexidos pola lexislación de propiedade intelectual vixente, a persoa que esta indique.
Consideraranse obras derivadas aquelas obras creadas a partir da licenciada, como por exemplo: as traducións e adaptacións; as revisións, actualizacións e anotacións; os compendios, resumos e extractos; os arranxos musicais e, en xeral, calquera transformación dunha obra literaria, artística ou científica. Para evitar a dúbida, se a obra consiste nunha composición musical ou gravación de sons, a sincronización temporal da obra cunha imaxe en movemento (synching) será considerada como unha obra derivada para os efectos desta licenza.
Terán a consideración de coleccións a compilación de obras alleas, de datos ou doutros elementos independentes como as antoloxías e as bases de datos que pola selección ou disposición dos seus contidos constitúan creacións intelectuais. A simple incorporación dunha obra nunha colección non dará lugar a unha derivada para os efectos desta licenza.
O licenciador é a persoa ou a entidade que ofrece a obra ou prestación nos termos desta licenza e lle concede os seus dereitos de explotación conforme o disposto nela.
Vostede é a persoa ou a entidade que exerce os dereitos concedidos mediante esta licenza e que non violou previamente os seus termos con respecto á obra ou á prestación, ou que recibiu o permiso expreso do licenciador para exercer os dereitos concedidos mediante esta licenza a pesar dunha violación anterior.
A transformación dunha obra comprende a súa tradución, adaptación e calquera outra modificación na súa forma da que se derive unha obra diferente. A creación resultante da transformación dunha obra terá a consideración de obra derivada.
Enténdese por reprodución a fixación directa ou indirecta, provisional ou permanente, por calquera medio e en calquera forma, de toda a obra ou a prestación ou de parte dela, que permita a súa comunicación ou a obtención de copias.
Enténdese por distribución a posta a disposición do público do orixinal ou das copias da obra ou da prestación, nun soporte tanxible, mediante a súa venda, alugueiro, préstamo ou de calquera outra forma.
Enténdese por comunicación pública todo acto polo cal unha pluralidade de persoas, que non pertenzan ao ámbito doméstico de quen a leva a cabo, poida ter acceso á obra ou á prestación sen previa distribución de exemplares a cada unha delas. Considérase comunicación pública a posta a disposición do público de obras ou prestacións por procedementos con fíos ou sen fíos, de tal forma que calquera persoa poida acceder a elas dende o lugar e no momento que elixa.
A explotación da obra ou a prestación comprende a reprodución, a distribución, a comunicación pública e, no seu caso, a transformación.

Todos os dereitos non concedidos expresamente polo licenciador quedan reservados, incluíndo a título enunciativo pero non limitativo, os dereitos morais irrenunciábeis recoñecidos pola lei aplicábel. Na medida en que o licenciador teña dereitos exclusivos previstos pola lei nacional vixente que implementa a directiva europea en materia de dereito sui generis sobre bases de datos, renuncia expresamente aos devanditos dereitos exclusivos.
4. Restricións. A concesión de dereitos que supón esta licenza atópase suxeita e limitada ás restricións seguintes:
Vostede pode reproducir, distribuír ou comunicar publicamente a obra ou prestación soamente baixo os termos desta licenza e debe incluír unha copia dela, ou o seu Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI). Vostede non pode ofrecer ou impoñer ningunha condición sobre a obra ou prestación que altere ou restrinxa os termos desta licenza ou o exercicio dos seus dereitos por parte dos seus concesionarios. Vostede non pode sublicenciar a obra ou prestación. Vostede debe manter intactos todos os avisos que se refiran a esta licenza e á ausencia de garantías. Vostede non pode reproducir, distribuír ou comunicar publicamente a obra ou prestación con medidas tecnolóxicas que controlen o acceso ou o uso dun xeito contrario aos termos desta licenza. Esta sección 4.a tamén afecta á obra ou prestación incorporada nunha colección, pero iso non implica que esta no seu conxunto quede automaticamente ou deba quedar suxeita aos seus termos. No caso que lle sexa requirido, logo de comunicación do licenciador, se vostede incorpora a obra nunha colección e/ou crea unha obra derivada, deberá quitar calquera crédito requirido no apartado 4.c, na medida do posíbel.
Vostede pode distribuír ou comunicar publicamente unha obra derivada no sentido desta licenza soamente baixo os seus termos ou outra licenza equivalente. Se vostede emprega esta mesma licenza debe incluír unha copia ou ben o seu URI, con cada obra derivada que vostede distribúa ou comunique publicamente. Vostede non pode ofrecer ou impoñer ningún termo respecto á obra derivada que altere ou restrinxa os termos desta licenza ou o exercicio dos seus dereitos por parte dos seus concesionarios.

Se emprega unha licenza equivalente debe cumprir cos requisitos que esta estableza cando distribúa ou comunique publicamente a obra derivada. Todas estas condicións aplícanse a unha obra derivada en tanto que incorporada a unha colección, pero non implica que esta teña que estar suxeita aos termos desta licenza.
Se vostede reproduce, distribúe ou comunica publicamente a obra ou a prestación, unha colección que a incorpore ou calquera obra derivada, debe manter intactos todos os avisos sobre a propiedade intelectual e indicar, de xeito razoábel conforme ao medio ou aos medios que vostede estea a empregar:
O nome do autor orixinal, ou o pseudónimo se é o caso, así como o do titular orixinario, se lle é facilitado.
O nome daquelas partes (por exemplo: institución, publicación, revista) que o titular orixinario e/ou o licenciador designen para ser recoñecidos no aviso legal, as condicións de uso, ou de calquera outro xeito razoábel.
O título da obra ou da prestación se lle é facilitado.

Para evitar calquera dúbida, debe facerse notar que as restricións anteriores (parágrafos 4.a, 4.b e 4.c) non son de aplicación a aquelas partes da obra ou a prestación obxecto desta licenza que unicamente poidan ser protexidas mediante o dereito sui generis sobre bases de datos recollido pola lei nacional vixente que transpoña a directiva europea de bases de datos.
5. Ausencia de responsabilidade

ALGUNHAS XURISDICIÓNS NON PERMITEN A EXCLUSIÓN DAS DITAS GARANTÍAS, POLO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PODE NON SERLLE DE APLICACIÓN A VOSTEDE.
6. Limitación de responsabilidade. SALVO QUE O DISPOÑA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE A LEI APLICÁBEL, EN NINGÚN CASO O LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSÁBEL ANTE VOSTEDE POR CALQUERA DANO RESULTANTE, XERAL OU ESPECIAL (INCLUÍDO O DANO EMERXENTE E O LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUÍTOS OU CAUSAIS, DIRECTOS OU INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENZA OU O USO DA OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN, MESMO SE O LICENCIADOR FOSE INFORMADO DA POSIBILIDADE DE TALES DANOS.
7. Finalización da licenza
Esta licenza e a concesión dos dereitos que contén rematarán automaticamente en caso de calquera incumprimento dos seus termos. As persoas ou entidades que recibiran de vostede obras derivadas ou coleccións baixo esta licenza, non obstante, non verán as súas licenzas finalizadas, sempre que tales persoas ou entidades se manteñan no cumprimento íntegro desta licenza.

Conforme ás condicións e termos anteriores, a concesión de dereitos desta licenza é vixente por todo o prazo de protección dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual segundo a lei aplicábel. Malia o anterior, o licenciador resérvase o dereito a divulgar ou publicar a obra ou a prestación en condicións distintas ás presentes, ou de retirar a obra ou a prestación en calquera momento. Non obstante, iso non suporá dar por concluída esta licenza (ou calquera outra licenza que fose concedida, ou sexa necesario ser concedida, baixo os termos desta licenza), que continuará vixente e con efectos completos a non ser que finalizara conforme ao establecido anteriormente, sen prexuízo do dereito moral de arrepentimento nos termos recoñecidos pola Lei de Propiedade Intelectual aplicábel.

Cada vez que vostede realice calquera tipo de explotación da obra ou a prestación, ou dunha colección que a incorpore, o licenciador ofrece aos terceiros e sucesivos licenciatarios a concesión de dereitos sobre a obra ou a prestación nas mesmas condicións e termos que a licenza concedida a vostede.
Cada vez que vostede realice calquera tipo de explotación dunha obra derivada, o licenciador ofrécelle aos terceiros e sucesivos licenciatarios a concesión de dereitos sobre a obra obxecto desta licenza nas mesmas condicións e termos que a licenza concedida a vostede.
Se algunha disposición desta licenza resulta inválida ou inaplicábel segundo a Lei vixente, iso non afectará a validez ou aplicabilidade do resto dos termos desta licenza e, sen ningunha acción adicional por calquera das partes deste acordo, tal disposición entenderase reformada no estritamente necesario para facer que tal disposición sexa válida e executiva.
Non se entenderá que existe renuncia respecto de ningún termo ou disposición desta licenza, nin que se consente ningunha violación desta, a menos que tal renuncia ou consentimento figure por escrito e leve a sinatura da parte que renuncie ou consinta.

L'ŒUVRE (TELLE QUE DEFINIE CI-DESSOUS) EST MISE A DISPOSITION SELON LES TERMES DE CETTE LICENCE PUBLIQUE CREATIVE COMMONS (CI-APRES DENOMMEE « LPCC » OU « LICENCE »). L'ŒUVRE EST PROTEGEE PAR LE DROIT DE LA PROPRIETE LITTERAIRE ET ARTISTIQUE OU TOUTE AUTRE LOI APPLICABLE. TOUTE UTILISATION DE L'ŒUVRE AUTRE QUE CELLE AUTORISEE PAR CETTE LICENCE EST RÉSERVÉE.
L’EXERCICE DE TOUT DROIT SUR L’ŒUVRE MISE A DISPOSITION EMPORTE ACCEPTATION DES TERMES DE LA LICENCE. EN RAISON DU CARACTERE CONTRACTUEL DE LA LICENCE, L’OFFRANT ACCORDE A L’ACCEPTANT LES DROITS CONTENUS DANS CETTE LICENCE EN CONTREPARTIE DE SON ACCEPTATION.
1. Définitions
Adaptation : œuvre créée soit à partir de l’Œuvre seule, soit à partir de l’Œuvre et d’autres œuvres préexistantes. Constituent notamment des Adaptations, les traductions, adaptations, œuvres composites, arrangements ou modifications d’une œuvre littéraire et artistique, d’un phonogramme, d’un vidéogramme ou d’une interprétation d’une œuvre, y compris les adaptations cinématographiques ou toute autre forme dans laquelle l’Œuvre est susceptible d’être refondue, transformée ou adaptée, notamment toute forme dérivée de l’original de manière identifiable. Il est toutefois entendu qu’une Œuvre qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence. Au cas où l’Œuvre serait une création musicale, une interprétation ou un phonogramme, la synchronisation de l’Œuvre avec une image animée sera considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence.
Collection : recueil d’œuvres qui, en raison de la sélection et de l’arrangement de son contenu, constitue une création intellectuelle dans laquelle chaque Œuvre se trouve incluse dans son ensemble, sous une forme non modifiée, avec une ou plusieurs autres contributions, chacune d’elles constituant des œuvres en elles-mêmes indépendantes et distinctes qui sont rassemblées pour former cet ensemble. Constituent notamment des Collections, les encyclopédies, anthologies, interprétations, phonogrammes, vidéogrammes ou émissions, ou toute œuvre autre que celles désignées à l’article 1(h). Aux fins de la présente Licence, une création qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation (telle que définie ci-dessus).
Distribution : mise à disposition du public de la version originale ou des copies de l'Œuvre ou d'une Adaptation, par la vente ou tout autre transfert de propriété ou par tout mode de communication au public dans la mesure où ces activités sont sources de droits exclusifs (location, prêt, etc).
Éléments de la Licence : attributs de la Licence tels qu'ils ont été choisis par l'Offrant et qui figurent dans le titre de cette Licence : Attribution – Partage à l'Identique.
Licence Compatible Creative Commons : licence qui est listée à https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses qui a été approuvée par Creative Commons substantiellement équivalente à cette Licence, parce que, au minimum, cette licence : (i) contient des conditions qui ont le même objectif, la même signification et le même effet que les Éléments de la Licence de cette Licence; et, (ii) permet explicitement de re-licencier les adaptations d'œuvres mises à disposition selon les termes de cette licence, sous cette Licence ou une licence Creative Commons d'une juridiction qui comporte les mêmes Éléments que cette Licence.
Offrant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou la ou les entité(s) qui mettent l’Œuvre à la disposition du public selon les termes de la présente Licence.
Titulaire de Droits Originaire : dans l’hypothèse d’une œuvre littéraire ou artistique, l’Auteur, entendu comme la ou les personnes physiques ou morales ou les entités qui ont créé l'Œuvre; et en outre, le cas échéant, (i) dans l’hypothèse d’une interprétation, les acteurs, chanteurs, musiciens, danseurs, ou toute autre personne qui joue, chante, déclame ou interprète l’œuvre littéraire, artistique ou folklorique; (ii) dans l’hypothèse d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme, le producteur, entendu comme la personne physique ou morale qui procède à la première fixation de l’interprétation sur un support; (iii) dans l’hypothèse d’une émission, l’entreprise de communication audiovisuelle qui procède à la diffusion de l’émission; (iv) dans l’hypothèse d’une base de données, le producteur.
Œuvre : création protégeable par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique (droits d'auteur, droits voisins et droits sui generis des producteurs de bases de données) mise à disposition selon les termes de la Licence. Peuvent notamment constituer une Œuvre toute création dans le domaine littéraire, scientifique et artistique, quel qu'en soit le mode ou la forme d'expression, y compris sous forme numérique, telle qu’un livre, un pamphlet et autres écrits ; une conférence, une allocution, une plaidoirie, un cours ou un sermon ou d'autres œuvres de même nature ; une œuvre dramatique ou une comédie musicale ; une œuvre chorégraphique ou un pantomime ; une composition musicale avec ou sans paroles ; une œuvre cinématographique à laquelle sont assimilées des œuvres exprimées par un procédé analogue à la cinématographie ; un dessin, une peinture, une création architecturale, une sculpture, une gravure ou une lithographie ; une création photographique à laquelle sont assimilées des œuvres exprimées par un procédé analogue à la photographie ; une œuvre des arts appliqués ; une œuvre graphique et typographique ; une illustration, une carte, un plan, un croquis ou une œuvre tridimensionnelle relative à la géographie, la topographie, l'architecture ou aux sciences ; une interprétation, une émission ; un phonogramme ou un vidéogramme ; une anthologie ou un recueil d’œuvres ou de données diverses ou une base de données dans la mesure où elle est protégée par le droit d’auteur ou le droit des producteurs de bases de données à la condition que celles-ci soient protégées par le droit applicable qui ne couvre pas seulement les bases de données protégées par le droit d'auteur (pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les sections 3(a), 3(b) et 3(c) ne s'appliqueront pas quand seul le droit des producteurs de bases de données s'applique); une interprétation réalisée par un artiste de cirque ou de variété ; les créations des industries saisonnières de l'habillement et de la parure.
Acceptant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou entité(s) qui exercent sur l’Œuvre les droits accordés par cette Licence et qui n’ont pas précédemment violé les conditions de cette Licence ou qui ont reçu l’autorisation expresse de la part de l’Offrant d’exercer les droits conférés par cette licence malgré une violation précédente.
Représentation : représentation de l’Œuvre et communications au public de ces représentations publiques par un procédé quelconque, quelque soit le type de transmission, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d’exploitation prévus par le droit applicable. Constitue également notamment une communication au public, la mise à disposition d’Œuvres protégées de manière à ce que le public puisse y avoir accès de l’endroit et au moment qu’il choisit individuellement, les interprétations et communications au public des interprétations de l'Œuvre y compris les interprétations publiques au format numérique ainsi qu’une diffusion ou une rediffusion de l’Œuvre par tout moyen, notamment par des signes, des sons ou des images.
Reproduction : toute copie de l'Œuvre de quelque manière et sous quelque forme que ce soit, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d'exploitation prévus par le droit applicable. Constitue aussi notamment une Reproduction, un enregistrement sonore ou visuel, une fixation ou une reproduction de fixations de l'Œuvre, y compris le stockage d'une interprétation, d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme au format numérique ou sur tout autre support électronique.
2. Exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs. Les exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs prévues par la loi applicable ne sont pas affectées par la présente Licence.
3. Étendue de l’autorisation. Sous réserve des conditions de la présente Licence, l’Offrant autorise l’Acceptant à exercer à titre gratuit, non-exclusif, pour la durée de protection des droits applicables et pour le monde entier, les droits de :
Reproduire, Distribuer et Représenter l'Œuvre, incorporer l'Œuvre dans une ou plusieurs Collections et reproduire l'Œuvre même incorporée dans lesdites Collections ;
Créer, Reproduire, Distribuer et Représenter des Adaptations, à la condition que ces Adaptations, notamment toute traduction sur tout support, soient accompagnées des mentions appropriées par étiquetage, démarcation ou identification de manière à faire apparaître clairement que des modifications ont été apportées à l’Œuvre. Par exemple, une traduction pourrait porter la mention « L’œuvre originaire a été traduite du français à l’anglais » ou en cas de modification « L’œuvre originaire a été modifiée » ;
Lorsque l'Œuvre est une base de données soumise au droit des producteurs de bases de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté :
Régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire.  Dans les cas où des utilisations de l'Œuvre seraient soumises à un régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire (auquel le droit ne permet pas de renoncer), l'Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances par l'intermédiaire de la société de perception et de répartition des droits compétente. Sont notamment concernés la radiodiffusion et la communication dans un lieu public de phonogrammes publiés à des fins de commerce, certains cas de retransmission par câble et satellite, la copie privée d'Œuvres fixées sur phonogrammes ou vidéogrammes, la reproduction par reprographie, le prêt en bibliothèque ;
Régime de gestion collective obligatoire assorti de possibilité de renonciation.  Dans les juridictions où il est possible de renoncer au droit de percevoir des redevances au titre d'un quelconque régime de licence légale ou de gestion collective obligatoire, l’Offrant renonce au droit exclusif de percevoir lesdites redevances découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits consentis en vertu de la présente Licence ;
Régime de gestion collective facultative.  L’Offrant renonce au droit de percevoir des redevances (que ce soit à titre individuel ou, au cas où l’Offrant serait membre d’un organisme de gestion collective facultative, par le biais de cet organisme) découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits accordés par la présente Licence.
Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous supports, médias, procédés, techniques et dans tous formats, incluant, dans la mesure du possible, les futurs médias et formats. Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus incluent le droit d'effectuer les modifications techniquement nécessaires à leur exercice sur d’autres supports, médias, procédés, techniques et formats. Les droits qui ne sont pas expressément accordés par l’Offrant à l’Acceptant par la présente Licence sont réservés. Dans le cas où l'Offrant est titulaire de droits sui generis sur les bases de données conformément à la loi nationale transposant la Directive Européenne sur les bases de données, l'Offrant renonce à ce droit.
4. Restrictions. L'autorisation accordée par l'Article 3 est expressément soumise et limitée par les restrictions suivantes :
L'Acceptant peut Distribuer ou Représenter l'Œuvre uniquement selon les termes de cette licence. Il doit inclure une copie de la Licence, ou son Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource (URI), à toute copie de l'Œuvre qu'il Distribue ou Représente. L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation sur l'Œuvre qui restreignent les termes de la Licence ou la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur d'exercer les droits qui lui sont accordés par cette Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut consentir de sous-licence sur l'Œuvre. Il doit conserver intacts tous les avertissements qui se réfèrent à cette Licence et l’avertissement sur les garanties avec chaque copie de l’Œuvre qu’il distribue ou représente. Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre, il ne doit pas imposer de mesure technique de protection susceptible de restreindre la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur à exercer les droits conférés par la présente Licence. L’article 4(a) s’applique à l’Œuvre telle qu’incorporée dans une Collection, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que la Collection soit soumise aux conditions de la Licence. Si l'Acceptant crée une Collection, il doit, à la demande de tout Offrant et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de la Collection toute référence audit Offrant, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(c), et ce conformément à la demande. Si l'Acceptant crée une Adaptation, il doit, à la demande de tout Offrant et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de l'Adaptation toute référence audit Offrant, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(c), et ce conformément à la demande.
L'Acceptant peut distribuer ou représenter une Adaptation uniquement sous les conditions : (i) de cette Licence ; (ii) d'une version ultérieure de cette Licence comprenant les mêmes Éléments de la Licence ; (iii) d'une licence Creative Commons non transposée or transposée dans une juridiction (dans cette version ou dans une version ultérieure de la licence) comprenant les mêmes Elements de la Licence (par exemple la licence « Attribution - Partage à l'Identique 3.0 Japon » (la « Licence Applicable ») ; (iv) d'une Licence Creative Commons Compatible. L'Acceptant peut distribuer une Adaptation selon l'une des licences mentionnées dans (iv) à la condition de respecter les conditions de cette licence. L'Acceptant doit distribuer l'Adaptation selon l'une des licences mentionnées dans (i), (ii) ou (iii) (la “Licence Applicable”) à la condition de respecter les termes de la Licence Applicable d'une manière générale et les dispositions suivantes : L'Acceptant doit inclure une copie, ou l'URI, de la Licence Applicable à toute copie de chaque Adaptation qu'il Reproduit, Distribue ou Représente. L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation sur l'Adaptation qui restreignent les termes de la Licence Applicable, ou l'exercice des droits accordés au bénéficiaire de l'Adaptation par la Licence Applicable. Il doit conserver intacts tous les avertissements qui se réfèrent à la Licence Applicable et à l’avertissement sur les garanties avec chaque copie de l’œuvre telle qu’incluse dans l’Adaptation que l’Acceptant distribue ou représente. Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente une Adaptation, il ne doit pas imposer de mesure technique de protection sur l’Adaptation susceptible de restreindre la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur d’exercer les droits accordés par la Licence Applicable. Le présent article 4(b) s’applique à l’Adaptation telle qu’incorporée dans une collection, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que la collection en dehors de l’Adaptation elle-même soit soumise aux conditions de la Licence Applicable.
Sauf introduction d’une demande prévue à l’Article 4(a), l'Acceptant doit, lorsqu'il distribue ou représente l'Œuvre, ou toute Adaptation ou Collection, garder intacts tous les avertissements sur les droits d’auteur concernant l’Œuvre et fournir, de manière appropriée au support ou au média qu'il utilise : (i) le nom du Titulaire de Droits Originaire (ou le pseudonyme, le cas échéant) s'il est mentionné, et/ou si le Titulaire de Droits Originaire et/ou l’Offrant désigne une ou des parties (par exemple un organisme de financement, un éditeur ou un journal) à attribuer (« les Parties à Attribuer ») dans l’avertissement sur les droits d’auteur de l’Offrant, les conditions d’utilisation ou, par un autre moyen approprié, le nom de la Partie ou des Parties à Attribuer ; (ii) le titre de l’Œuvre, s’il est mentionné ; (iii) dans la mesure du possible, l’URI que l'Offrant spécifie comme étant associée à l’Œuvre, sauf si ledit URI ne fait pas référence à l’avertissement sur les droits ou aux informations sur la licence relative à l’Œuvre ; et, (iv) conformément à l’Article 3(b), dans le cas d’une Adaptation, une mention identifiant l’utilisation de l'Œuvre dans l’Adaptation (par exemple « traduction française de l’Œuvre par le Titulaire de Droits Originaire » ou « scénario fondé sur l’Œuvre du Titulaire de Droits Originaire »). Les crédits requis par cet article 4(c) pourront être mis en œuvre par tout moyen approprié, sous réserve, toutefois, qu’en cas d’Adaptation ou de Collection, ces crédits figurent d’une manière au moins aussi visible que les crédits relatifs aux autres auteurs y ayant contribué, si de tels crédits apparaissent. A toutes fins utiles, l'Acceptant ne pourra utiliser les crédits requis par cet Article qu'à des fins d’attribution, de la manière susmentionnée et en exerçant les droits accordés par la Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut, implicitement ou explicitement, affirmer ou laisser supposer une quelconque relation, parrainage ou aval par le Titulaire de Droits Originaire, l'Offrant, la ou les Parties à Attribuer selon le cas, et l’Acceptant ou son utilisation de l’Œuvre, sans avoir l’autorisation distincte, expresse, écrite et préalable du Titulaire de Droits Originaire, de l'Offrant et/ou des Parties à Attribuer.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les restrictions accordées par l’article 3 et les articles 4(a) et 4(b) ne sont pas applicables à la partie de l’œuvre qui est soumise uniquement aux droits des producteurs de bases de données.
A moins d’une limitation aux droits exclusifs prévue par la loi applicable, si l’Acceptant Reproduit, Distribue ou Représente l’Œuvre en elle-même, ou au sein d’une Adaptation ou d’une Collection, il doit respecter les droits moraux du Titulaire de Droits Originaire dans la mesure où ce Titulaire en bénéficie (comme les auteurs et les artistes-interprètes) et ne peut y renoncer.
5. Représentation, Garanties et Avertissement
SAUF ACCORD CONTRAIRE CONVENU PAR ECRIT ENTRE LES PARTIES ET DANS LA LIMITE DU DROIT APPLICABLE, L’OFFRANT MET L’ŒUVRE A DISPOSITION DE L’ACCEPTANT EN L’ETAT, SANS DECLARATION OU GARANTIE D’AUCUNE SORTE, EXPRESSE, IMPLICITE, LÉGALE OU AUTRE. SONT NOTAMMENT EXCLUES LES GARANTIES CONCERNANT LA COMMERCIABILITE, LA CONFORMITE, LES VICES CACHES ET LES VICES APPARENTS.
6. Limitation de responsabilité. A l'exception des garanties d'ordre public imposées par la loi applicable, l'Offrant ne sera en aucun cas tenu responsable vis-à-vis de l'Acceptant, sur la base d'aucune théorie juridique ni en raison d'aucun préjudice direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, résultant de l'exécution du présent Contrat ou de l'utilisation de l'Œuvre, y compris dans l'hypothèse où l'Offrant avait connaissance de la possible existence d'un tel préjudice.
7. Résiliation
Toute violation par l'Acceptant des clauses de cette Licence entraînera sa résiliation automatique et la fin des droits qui en découlent. Les Licences accordées aux personnes physiques ou morales qui ont reçu de la part de l'Acceptant des Adaptations ou des Collections dans le cadre de la présente Licence ne seront pas résiliées, à condition que lesdites personnes physiques ou morales respectent pleinement leurs obligations. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 de la présente Licence continuent à s'appliquer après la résiliation de celle-ci.
Sous réserve des conditions mentionnées ci-dessus, la présente Licence est accordée pour toute la durée du droit d'auteur ou tout autre droit applicable à l'Œuvre. Néanmoins, l'Offrant se réserve à tout moment le droit d'exploiter l'Œuvre sous une autre Licence ou d'en cesser la Distribution à tout moment. Cependant, cette décision ne devra pas conduire à retirer cette Licence (ou toute autre Licence qui a été accordée, ou doit être accordée en application de la présente Licence) qui continuera à s'appliquer dans tous ses effets à moins qu'elle ne soit résiliée dans les conditions décrites ci-dessus.
8. Divers
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre ou une Collection, l’Offrant accorde au bénéficiaire suivant, une licence sur l’Œuvre avec les mêmes termes et conditions que celle accordée à l’Acceptant.
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente une Adaptation, l’Offrant accorde au bénéficiaire une licence sur l’œuvre dans des conditions identiques à celles accordées à l’Acceptant.
Si en vertu de la loi applicable, une quelconque disposition de la présente Licence était déclarée nulle, non valide ou inapplicable, cela n'aurait pas pour effet d'annuler ou de rendre inapplicables les autres dispositions de la Licence. Sans action ultérieure des parties, ladite disposition sera modifiée dans la mesure minimum nécessaire à sa validité et son applicabilité.
Aucune des conditions ou des dispositions de la présente Licence ne sera réputée comme ayant fait l'objet d'une renonciation, et aucune violation comme ayant été acceptée, sans le consentement écrit et signé de la partie concernée.
La présente Licence représente l'intégralité de l'accord conclu entre les parties à propos de l'Œuvre, objet de la présente Licence. Il n'existe aucun élément annexe, accord ou mandat portant sur cette Œuvre qui ne soit mentionné ci-dessus. L'Offrant ne sera tenu par aucune disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une communication provenant de l'Acceptant. La présente Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord écrit de l'Offrant et de l'Acceptant.
Avertissements de Creative Commons

Creative Commons décline toute responsabilité à l'égard de l'Acceptant ou de toute autre partie, quel que soit le fondement légal de cette responsabilité et quel que soit le préjudice subi, direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, qui surviendrait du fait de cette Licence. Cependant, si Creative Commons s'est expressément identifié comme Offrant pour mettre une Œuvre à disposition selon les termes de cette Licence, Creative Commons jouira de tous les droits et obligations d'un Offrant.

Στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι δικαιούχος του δικαιώματος ειδικής φύσης (sui generis) του κατασκευαστή βάσης δεδομένων σύμφωνα με τον Ελληνικό νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας, όπως αυτό ισχύει κατ’ εφαρμογή στο Ελληνικό Δίκαιο της Οδηγίας 96/9/ΕΟΚ για τη νομική προστασία των βάσεων δεδομένων, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια παραιτείται αυτού του δικαιώματός του.

Σε κάθε διανομή ή δημόσια παρουσίαση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης, δεν επιτρέπετε να κάνετε χρήση οποιουδήποτε τεχνολογικού μέτρου επί του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που έχει ως αποτέλεσμα τον περιορισμό της άσκησης από τον λήπτη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης των δικαιωμάτων που παρέχονται σ’ αυτόν υπό τους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Η παρούσα Ρήτρα 4(α) ισχύει για το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης που είναι ενσωματωμένο σε Συλλογικό Έργο, αλλά δεν απαιτείται το Συλλογικό Έργο ξεχωριστά από το ίδιο το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης να υπόκειται στους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας.

Αν δημιουργείτε Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση), εφόσον γίνει γνωστοποίηση από τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια πρέπει, στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατόν, να αφαιρέσετε από το Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση) κάθε αναφορά σε δικαιούχο όπως αυτό απαιτείται από τη Ρήτρα 4(δ).

Attribution—NonCommercial—ShareAlike 3 U.S.) (Εφαρμοστέα Άδεια). Είστε υποχρεωμένοι να περιλάβετε ένα αντίγραφο της Εφαρμοστέας Άδειας ή το Κανονιστικό Αναγνωριστικό Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier) αυτής της Εφαρμοστέας Άδειας με κάθε αντίγραφο του Παράγωγου Έργου (τροποποίησης) το οποίο διανέμετε, ή παρουσιάζετε στο κοινό.

Πρέπει να τηρείτε άθικτες όλες τις γνωστοποιήσεις που αφορούν την Εφαρμοστέα Άδεια και τους περιορισμούς της ευθύνης σε κάθε αντίγραφο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης όπως περιέχονται στο Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση) που διανέμετε ή παρουσιάζετε δημόσια. Σε κάθε διανομή ή δημόσια παρουσίαση του Παράγωγου Έργου (τροποποίησης), δεν επιτρέπετε να κάνετε χρήση οποιουδήποτε τεχνολογικού μέτρου επί του Παράγωγου Έργου (τροποποίησης) που έχει ως αποτέλεσμα τον περιορισμό της άσκησης από τον λήπτη του Παράγωγου Έργου (τροποποίησης) των δικαιωμάτων που παρέχονται σ’ αυτόν υπό τους όρους της Εφαρμοστέας Άδειας. Η παρούσα Ρήτρα 4(β) ισχύει για το Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση) ως ενσωματωμένο σε Συλλογικό Έργο, αλλά δεν απαιτείται το Συλλογικό Έργο ξεχωριστά από το ίδιο το Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση) να υπόκειται στους όρους της Εφαρμοστέας Άδειας.
γ.
Αν διανείμετε, ή παρουσιάζετε στο κοινό το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης ή το Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση) ή το Συλλογικό Έργο, πρέπει, εφόσον δεν έχει υποβληθεί αίτημα σχετικό με τη Ρήτρα 4(α), να κρατήσετε άθικτες όλες τις πληροφορίες για το δικαιούχο πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας και να παρέχετε, ανάλογα με το μέσον ή τα μέσα που χρησιμοποιείτε: (1) το όνομα (ή το ψευδώνυμο) του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή του Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων αν υπάρχει και/ή (2) αν ο Πρώτος Δημιουργός (Αρχικός Δικαιούχος) ή ο Δικαιούχος Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων και/ή ο Χορηγών την Άδεια ορίσει, στους όρους χρήσης ή σε άλλο σχετικό μέσο, άλλον ή άλλους (π.χ. ένα ινστιτούτο, εκδότη, περιοδικό) αναφορικά με τις πληροφορίες για τα δικαιώματα πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας όσον αφορά τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, το όνομα αυτού ή αυτών («Δικαιούχοι»). Επίσης, τον τίτλο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης αν υπάρχει, και (3) στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατό, το Κανονιστικό Αναγνωριστικό Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier), αν υπάρχει, το οποίο ο Χορηγών την Άδεια προσδιορίζει συνδεόμενο με το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, εκτός αν αυτό το Κανονιστικό Αναγνώρισης Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier) δεν αναφέρεται στις πληροφορίες για την πνευματική ιδιοκτησία ή στις πληροφορίες χορήγησης άδειας για το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης. Επίσης, (4) υπόψη της Ρήτρας 3(β), στην περίπτωση του Παράγωγου Έργου (τροποποίησης), μία αναφορά που βεβαιώνει τη χρήση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης στο Παράγωγο Έργο (π.χ. «Γαλλική μετάφραση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων» ή «Σενάριο βασισμένο στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων»). Αυτή η αναφορά που απαιτείται σύμφωνα με τη Ρήτρα 4(δ) μπορεί να γίνει με οποιονδήποτε εύλογο τρόπο, υπό τον όρο, όμως, ότι στην περίπτωση Παράγωγου Έργου (τροποποίησης) ή Συλλογικού Έργου, κατ’ ελάχιστη προϋπόθεση αυτή η αναφορά θα φαίνεται όπου εμφανίζεται οποιαδήποτε άλλη ανάλογη αναφορά δικαιούχου για συγγραφικό δικαίωμα και κατά τρόπο τουλάχιστον τόσο εμφανή όπως αυτή η άλλη ανάλογη αναφορά δικαιούχου για συγγραφικό δικαίωμα. Για την άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, μπορείτε να χρησιμοποιήσετε τις αναφορές που απαιτούνται από αυτή τη Ρήτρα για το σκοπό της πληροφόρησης περί το δικαιούχο πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας όπως ορίζεται παραπάνω, και επιπλέον κατά την άσκηση των δικαιωμάτων Σας υπό τους όρους αυτής της Άδειας, δεν μπορείτε έμμεσα ή άμεσα να επικαλεστείτε ή εννοήσετε την ύπαρξη οποιασδήποτε σχέσης ή έγκρισης από τον Πρώτο Δημιουργό (Αρχικό Δικαιούχο) ή το Δικαιούχο Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων, τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, ή το Δικαιούχο που αφορά Εσάς ή τις χρήσεις του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης από Εσάς, χωρίς ταυτόχρονα να την αποδεικνύετε με ξεχωριστή, έγγραφη άδεια του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή του Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων, του Χορηγούντα την Άδεια ή του Δικαιούχου.
δ.
Προς άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, οι περιορισμοί που αναφέρονται παραπάνω [4(α), 4(β), 4(γ)] δεν εφαρμόζονται σ’ αυτά τα μέρη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που περιλαμβάνονται στον ορισμό «Αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης» αυτής της Άδειας αποκλειστικά επειδή συνιστούν αντικείμενο του δικαιώματος ειδικής φύσης (sui generis) του κατασκευαστή βάσης δεδομένων σύμφωνα με τον Ελληνικό νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας κατ’ εφαρμογή της Οδηγίας 96/9/ΕΟΚ.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE A SOLICITOR-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT, RELATED RIGHTS, SUI GENERIS DATABASE RIGHT, AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
This Licence enables You (all capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and Distribute the Work worldwide provided that You credit the Original Author and comply with the other terms and conditions of this Licence.
'The Licensor' (one or more natural or legal persons offering the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence)
and
'You' (the natural or legal person acquiring rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.)
agree as follows:
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole, which by reason of the selection and arrangement of its contents constitutes an intellectual creation.
"Creative Commons Compatible Licence" means a licence that is listed at https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this Licence, including, at a minimum, because that licence: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the Licence Elements of this Licence; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of derivatives of works made available under that licence, under this Licence, under a Creative Commons Unported licence or under a Creative Commons jurisdiction licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence.
"Derivative Work" means any work created by the editing, modification, adaptation or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Derivative Work, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"Licence Elements" means the following high-level licence attributes indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution, ShareAlike.
"Original Author" means the natural or legal person or persons that created the Work.
"Performance" means (i) a performance of any actors, singers, musicians, dancers or other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works or expressions of works of folklore, which is a live performance given by one or more individuals, and shall include a performance of a variety act or any similar presentation or (ii) a broadcast or rebroadcast of the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. A performance of a literary work includes a reading or recitation and a performance of a dramatic work includes a choreographic work or a work of mime. “Perform” shall be construed accordingly.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
"Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. For the purposes of this Licence a Work shall also be taken to mean a live Performance or a database insofar as these are protected under the applicable law within Your jurisdiction.
For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number.
2. Fair Dealing Rights Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses or rights permitted under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.
3. Licence Grant Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, the Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below for the duration of copyright, related right and/or sui generis database right in the Work.
to Reproduce the Work;
to create one or more Derivative Works; provided that any such Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works;
to Reproduce Derivative Works or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work;
to Distribute or Perform the Work, Derivative Works, or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work to the public in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter created.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d) and Section 6.
Where the Licensor is the owner of the sui generis database rights under national law implementing Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases, the Licensor waives these rights.
4. Restrictions The Licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence. You must make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and Collective Works Distributed or Performed by You. You may not offer or impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work that restrict the terms of this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to the recipient under the terms of the Licence. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. When You Distribute or Perform the Work, You must not impose any effective technological measures on the Work or the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Licence. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
You may Distribute or Perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of (i) this Licence; (ii) a later version of this Licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence; (iii) either the Creative Commons Unported licence or a Creative Commons jurisdiction licence (either this or a later licence version) that contains the same Licence Elements as this Licence (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported) ("Applicable Licence"); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible Licence. If You license the Derivative Work under one of the licences mentioned in (iv), You must comply with the terms of that licence. If You license the Derivative Work under the terms of any of the licences mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the “Applicable Licence”), You must comply with the terms of the Applicable Licence and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable Licence with every copy of each Derivative Work You Distribute, display or Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Work that restrict the terms of the Applicable Licence or the ability of the recipient of the Derivative Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable Licence; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Derivative Work You Distribute or Perform; (IV) When You Distribute or Perform the Derivative Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Derivative Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable Licence. This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a collective work, but this does not require the collective work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable Licence.
If You Distribute, or Perform the Work or any Derivative Work or Collective Work, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilising: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the work by original author," or "Screenplay based on original work by original author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this Licence, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and not waivable by applicable law.
For the avoidance of doubt: The restrictions mentioned above (4(a) to 4(c)) do not apply to those parts of the Work considered to fall within the definition of a "Work" under this Licence exclusively because they meet the criteria of the sui generis database right under national law implementing Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases.
Additional Provisions for recipients making use of the Work
5. Further licence from the Licensor
Each time You Distribute or Perform the Work, Collective Work, or a Derivative Work, the Licensor offers to the relevant recipient a licence to use the Work (or the original Work in case of a Derivative Work) on the same terms and conditions as the Licence granted to You hereunder.
6. Reservation and Waiver of Rights
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory Licence Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence;
Waivable Compulsory Licence Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence; and,
Voluntary Licence Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
7. Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as required by law, the Work is licensed by the Licensor on an "as is" and "as available" basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
8. Limit of Liability
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.
9. Termination
This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Natural or legal persons who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such natural or legal persons remain in full compliance with those Licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this Licence.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright, related right and/or sui generis database right in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
10. General
The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this Licence is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or unenforceable.
This Licence constitutes the entire licence between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication in any form.
No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
Creative Commons Notice
Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this Licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

L'ASSOCIAZIONE CREATIVE COMMONS (DI SEGUITO "CREATIVE COMMONS") NON È UNO STUDIO LEGALE E NON FORNISCE SERVIZI DI CONSULENZA LEGALE. LA DISTRIBUZIONE DI QUESTO MODELLO DI CONTRATTO DI LICENZA NON INSTAURA UN RAPPORTO AVVOCATO-CLIENTE. CREATIVE COMMONS FORNISCE INFORMAZIONI DA CONSIDERARSI "COSÌ COME SONO". CREATIVE COMMONS NON PRESTA ALCUNA GARANZIA PER LE INFORMAZIONI FORNITE E SI ESIME DA OGNI RESPONSABILITÀ PER I DANNI DERIVANTI DALL'USO DELLE STESSE.
La Licenza
L'OPERA (COME SOTTO DEFINITA) È MESSA A DISPOSIZIONE SULLA BASE DEI TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA "CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE" ("CCPL" O "LICENZA"). L'OPERA È PROTETTA DAL DIRITTO D'AUTORE, DAGLI ALTRI DIRITTI ATTRIBUITI DALLA LEGGE SUL DIRITTO D'AUTORE (DIRITTI CONNESSI, DIRITTI SULLE BANCHE DATI, ECC.) E/O DALLE ALTRE LEGGI APPLICABILI. OGNI UTILIZZAZIONE DELL'OPERA CHE NON SIA AUTORIZZATA AI SENSI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA E/O DELLE ALTRE LEGGI APPLICABILI È PROIBITA.
CON IL SEMPLICE ESERCIZIO SULL'OPERA DI UNO QUALUNQUE DEI DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI, TU ACCETTI E TI OBBLIGHI A RISPETTARE INTEGRALMENTE I TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA. IL LICENZIANTE CONCEDE A TE I DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI A CONDIZIONE CHE TU ACCETTI DI RISPETTARE I TERMINI E LE CONDIZIONI DI CUI ALLA PRESENTE LICENZA.
Art. 1 - Definizioni
Ai fini e per gli effetti della presente licenza, si intende per
"Collezione di Opere", un'opera, come un numero di un periodico, un'antologia o un'enciclopedia, nella quale l'Opera nella sua interezza e forma originale, unitamente ad altri contributi costituenti loro stessi opere distinte ed autonome, sono raccolti in un'unità collettiva. Un'opera che costituisce Collezione di Opere non verrà considerata Opera Derivata (come sotto definita) ai fini della presente Licenza;
"Opera Derivata", un'opera basata sull'Opera ovvero sull'Opera insieme con altre opere preesistenti, come una traduzione, un arrangiamento musicale, un adattamento teatrale, narrativo, cinematografico, una registrazione di suoni, una riproduzione d'arte, un digesto, una sintesi, o ogni altra forma in cui l'Opera possa essere riproposta, trasformata o adattata. Nel caso in cui un'Opera tra quelle qui descritte costituisca già Collezione di Opere, essa non sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini della presente Licenza. Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, quando l'Opera sia una composizione musicale o registrazione di suoni, la sincronizzazione dell'Opera in relazione con un'immagine in movimento ("synching") sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini di questa Licenza;
"Licenziante", l'individuo, gli individui, l'ente o gli enti che offre o offrono l'Opera secondo i termini e le condizioni della presente Licenza;
"Autore Originario", il soggetto o i soggetti che ha o hanno creato l'Opera;
"Opera", l'opera dell'ingegno o, comunque, qualsiasi bene o prestazione suscettibile di protezione in forza delle leggi sul diritto d'autore (diritto d'autore, diritti connessi, diritto sui generis sulle banche dati, ecc.), la cui utilizzazione è offerta nel rispetto dei termini della presente Licenza;
"Tu"/"Te", l'individuo o l'ente che esercita i diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza e che non abbia precedentemente violato i termini della presente Licenza relativi all'Opera o che, nonostante una precedente violazione degli stessi, abbia ricevuto espressa autorizzazione dal Licenziante all'esercizio dei diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza;
"Elementi della Licenza", gli attributi fondamentali della Licenza scelti dal Licenziante ed indicati nel titolo della Licenza: Attribuzione, Condividi allo stesso modo;
"Licenza Compatibile con Creative Commons", una licenza elencata presso https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, che Creative Commons abbia riconosciuto come essenzialmente equivalente a questa Licenza, poiché tale licenza presenta almeno le seguenti caratteristiche: (i) le sue condizioni hanno lo stesso scopo, significato ed effetto degli Elementi della Licenza di questa Licenza; e (ii) tale licenza permette esplicitamente di licenziare le Opere Derivate dalle opere, che sono state rese disponibili tramite tale licenza, nei termini di questa Licenza o di una licenza Creative Commons "Unported" (non adattata) con gli stessi Elementi della Licenza di questa Licenza o di una licenza nazionale Creative Commons con gli stessi Elementi della Licenza di questa Licenza.
Art. 2 - Libere Utilizzazioni
La presente Licenza non intende in alcun modo ridurre, limitare o restringere alcuna utilizzazione non protetta dal diritto d'autore o alcun diritto di libera utilizzazione o l'operare della regola dell'esaurimento del diritto o altre limitazioni dei diritti sull'Opera derivanti dalle leggi applicabili.
Art. 3 - Concessione della Licenza
Nel rispetto dei termini e delle condizioni contenute nella presente Licenza, il Licenziante concede a Te una licenza per tutto il mondo, gratuita, non esclusiva e perpetua (per la durata del diritto d'autore applicabile) che autorizza ad esercitare i diritti sull'Opera qui di seguito elencati:
riproduzione dell'Opera, incorporazione dell'Opera in una o più Collezioni di Opere e riproduzione dell'Opera come incorporata nelle Collezioni di Opere;
creazione e riproduzione di un'Opera Derivata, a condizione che l'Opera Derivata (ivi incluse le traduzioni, con qualsiasi mezzo esse siano realizzate) contenga, nei modi appropriati alla forma dell'Opera Derivata, una chiara indicazione del fatto che sono state effettuate delle modifiche rispetto all'Opera originaria. Per esempio, una traduzione potrebbe contenere l'indicazione "questa è la traduzione in spagnolo dell'opera originaria, scritta in inglese"; una modifica potrebbe contenere l'indicazione "l'opera originaria è stata modificata";
distribuzione di copie dell'Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera è registrata, noleggio e prestito di copie dell'Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale dell'Opera, e ciò anche quando l'Opera sia incorporata in Collezioni di Opere;
distribuzione di copie dell'Opera Derivata o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera Derivata è registrata, noleggio e prestito di copie dell'Opera Derivata o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera Derivata è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale di Opere Derivate.
Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, se l'Opera sia di tipo musicale:
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione o esecuzione di opere incluse in repertori. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione o esecuzione, anche in forma digitale (ad es. tramite webcast) dell'Opera.
Compensi per versioni cover. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per ogni disco che Tu crei e distribuisci a partire dall'Opera (versione cover).
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico dell'Opera mediante fonogrammi. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che se l'Opera è una registrazione di suoni, il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. IMAIE), per la comunicazione al pubblico dell'Opera, anche in forma digitale.
Altri compensi previsti dalla legge italiana. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere i compensi a lui attribuiti dalla legge italiana sul diritto d'autore (ad es. per l'inserimento dell'Opera in un'antologia ad uso scolastico ex art. 70 l. 633/1941). Al Licenziante spettano in ogni caso i compensi irrinunciabili a lui attribuiti dalla medesima legge (ad es. l'equo compenso spettante all'autore di opere musicali, cinematografiche, audiovisive o di sequenze di immagini in movimento nel caso di noleggio ai sensi dell'art. 18-bis l. 633/1941).
I diritti sopra descritti potranno essere esercitati con ogni mezzo di comunicazione e in tutti i formati. Tra i diritti di cui sopra si intende compreso il diritto di apportare all'Opera le modifiche che si rendessero tecnicamente necessarie per l'esercizio di detti diritti tramite altri mezzi di comunicazione o su altri formati. Tutti i diritti non espressamente concessi dal Licenziante rimangono riservati. Tutti i diritti morali irrinunciabili riconosciuti dalla legge applicabile rimangono riservati.
Qualora l'Opera concessa in licenza includa una o più banche dati sulle quali il Licenziante è titolare di un diritto sui generis ai sensi delle norme nazionali di attuazione della Direttiva 96/9/CE sulle banche dati, il Licenziante rinuncia a far valere il diritto corrispondente.
Art. 4 - Restrizioni
La Licenza concessa in conformità al precedente punto 3 è espressamente assoggettata a, e limitata da, le seguenti restrizioni:
Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l'Opera, anche in forma digitale, solo alle condizioni della presente Licenza e, insieme ad ogni copia dell'Opera (o supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l'Opera) che distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi proporre o imporre alcuna condizione relativa all'Opera che restringa i termini della presente Licenza o la capacità da parte di chi riceve l'Opera di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la presente Licenza. Non puoi concedere l'Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all'esclusione delle garanzie. Quando distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico l'Opera, non puoi utilizzare alcuna misura tecnologica tale da limitare la capacità di chiunque riceva l'Opera da Te di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la presente licenza. Questo art. 4.a si applica all'Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di per sé ed indipendentemente dall'Opera stessa debba essere soggetta ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante, devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente possibile, ogni riferimento in accordo con quanto previsto dall'art. 4.c, come da richiesta. Qualora Tu crei un'Opera Derivata, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall'Opera Derivata stessa, nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento in accordo con quanto previsto dall'art. 4.c, come da richiesta.
Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico un'Opera Derivata, anche in forma digitale, solo alle condizioni (i) della presente Licenza, (ii) di una versione successiva di questa Licenza dotata degli stessi Elementi della Licenza di questa Licenza, (iii) della licenza Creative Commons "Unported" (non adattata) o di una licenza Creative Commons di un'altra giurisdizione (sia la presente versione 3.0 che una successiva) che contenga gli stessi Elementi della Licenza di questa Licenza (ad es. Attribuzione-Condividi allo stesso modo 3.0 "Unported") (la "Licenza Applicabile"), (iv) di una Licenza Compatibile con Creative Commons. Se Tu concedi in licenza un'Opera Derivata con una delle licenze di cui a questo punto (iv) devi rispettare i termini di tale licenza. Se Tu concedi in licenza un'Opera Derivata con una delle licenze di cui ai punti (i), (ii) o (iii) (la "Licenza Applicabile") Tu devi rispettare tutte le condizioni della Licenza Applicabile oltre alle seguenti condizioni. Insieme ad ogni copia dell'Opera Derivata (o supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l'Opera Derivata) che distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, Tu devi includere una copia della Licenza Applicabile, o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi proporre o imporre alcuna condizione relativa all'Opera Derivata che restringa i termini della Licenza Applicabile o la capacità di chiunque riceva l'Opera Derivata da Te di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la Licenza Applicabile. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative che si riferiscono alla Licenza Applicabile ed all'esclusione delle garanzie. Quando Tu distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico l'Opera Derivata, non puoi utilizzare sull'Opera Derivata alcuna misura tecnologica tale da limitare la capacità di chiunque riceva l'Opera Derivata da Te di esercitare i diritti concessi a tale soggetto in forza della Licenza Applicabile. Questo art.4.b si applica all'Opera Derivata anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione di Opere, ma ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di per sé ed indipendentemente dall'Opera Derivata debba esser soggetta ai termini ed alle condizioni della Licenza Applicabile.
Qualora Tu distribuisca, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegua, reciti o esponga in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, l'Opera (come definita dal succitato art. 1) o qualsiasi Opera Derivata (come definita dal succitato art. 1) o Collezione di Opere (come definita dal succitato art. 1), a meno che sia stata avanzata una richiesta ai sensi dell'art. 4.a, devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative sul diritto d'autore sull'Opera. Devi riconoscere una menzione adeguata rispetto al mezzo di comunicazione o supporto che utilizzi: (i) all'Autore Originario citando il suo nome (o lo pseudonimo, se del caso), ove fornito; e/o (ii) alle terze parti designate, se l'Autore Originario e/o il Licenziante hanno designato una o più terze parti (ad esempio, una istituzione finanziatrice, un ente editoriale, un giornale) ("Parti Designate") perché siano citate nell'informativa sul diritto d'autore del Licenziante o nei termini di servizio o con altri mezzi ragionevoli; (iii) il titolo dell'Opera, se indicato; (iv) nella misura in cui sia ragionevolmente possibile, l'Uniform Resource Identifier, che il Licenziante specifichi dover essere associato con l'Opera, salvo che tale URI non faccia alcun riferimento alla informativa sul diritto d'autore o non dia informazioni sulla licenza dell'Opera; (v) inoltre, in conformità a quanto previsto dall'art. 3.b, in caso di Opera Derivata, devi menzionare l'uso dell'Opera nell'Opera Derivata (ad esempio, "traduzione francese dell'Opera dell'Autore Originario", o "sceneggiatura basata sull'Opera originaria dell'Autore Originario"). La menzione richiesta dal presente art. 4.c può essere realizzata in qualsiasi maniera ragionevole possibile; in ogni caso, in ipotesi di Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, qualora compaia una menzione di tutti i coautori dell'Opera Derivata o della Collezione di Opere, allora essa deve essere parte di tale menzione e deve apparire con lo stesso risalto concesso alla menzione degli altri coautori. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che la menzione di cui al presente articolo ha lo scopo di riconoscere la paternità dell'Opera nei modi sopra indicati e che, esercitando i Tuoi diritti ai sensi della presente Licenza, Tu non puoi implicitamente o esplicitamente affermare o fare intendere un qualsiasi collegamento con l'Autore Originario, il Licenziante e/o le Parti Designate, o che l'Autore Originario, il Licenziante e/o le Parti Designate sponsorizzino o avallino Te o il Tuo utilizzo dell'Opera, a meno che non sussista un apposito, espresso e preventivo consenso scritto dell'Autore Originario, del Licenziante e/o delle Parti Designate.
Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che le restrizioni di cui ai precedenti punti 4.a, 4.b e 4.c non si applicano a quelle parti dell'opera che siano da considerarsi Opera ai sensi della presente Licenza solo in quanto protette dal diritto sui generis su banca dati ai sensi delle norme nazionali di attuazione della Direttiva 96/9/CE sulle banche dati.
Art. 5 - Dichiarazioni, Garanzie ed Esonero da responsabilità
SALVO CHE SIA ESPRESSAMENTE CONVENUTO ALTRIMENTI PER ISCRITTO FRA LE PARTI, IL LICENZIANTE OFFRE L'OPERA IN LICENZA "COSÌ COM'È" E NON FORNISCE ALCUNA DICHIARAZIONE O GARANZIA DI QUALSIASI TIPO CON RIGUARDO ALL'OPERA, SIA ESSA ESPRESSA O IMPLICITA, DI FONTE LEGALE O DI ALTRO TIPO, ESSENDO QUINDI ESCLUSE, FRA LE ALTRE, LE GARANZIE RELATIVE AL TITOLO, ALLA COMMERCIABILITÀ, ALL'IDONEITÀ PER UN FINE SPECIFICO E ALLA NON VIOLAZIONE DI DIRITTI DI TERZI O ALLA MANCANZA DI DIFETTI LATENTI O DI ALTRO TIPO, ALL'ESATTEZZA O ALLA PRESENZA DI ERRORI, SIANO ESSI ACCERTABILI O MENO. ALCUNE GIURISDIZIONI NON CONSENTONO L'ESCLUSIONE DI GARANZIE IMPLICITE E QUINDI TALE ESCLUSIONE PUÒ NON APPLICARSI A TE.
Art. 6 - Limitazione di Responsabilità
SALVI I LIMITI STABILITI DALLA LEGGE APPLICABILE, IL LICENZIANTE NON SARÀ IN ALCUN CASO RESPONSABILE NEI TUOI CONFRONTI A QUALUNQUE TITOLO PER ALCUN TIPO DI DANNO, SIA ESSO SPECIALE, INCIDENTALE, CONSEQUENZIALE, PUNITIVO O ESEMPLARE, DERIVANTE DALLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DALL'USO DELL'OPERA, ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL LICENZIANTE SIA STATO EDOTTO SULLA POSSIBILITÀ DI TALI DANNI. NESSUNA CLAUSOLA DI QUESTA LICENZA ESCLUDE O LIMITA LA RESPONSABILITÀ NEL CASO IN CUI QUESTA DIPENDA DA DOLO O COLPA GRAVE.
Art. 7 - Risoluzione
La presente Licenza si intenderà risolta di diritto e i diritti con essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente, senza necessità di alcuna comunicazione in tal senso da parte del Licenziante, in caso di qualsivoglia inadempimento dei termini della presente Licenza da parte Tua, ed in particolare delle disposizioni di cui ai punti 4.a, 4.b e/o 4.c, essendo la presente Licenza condizionata risolutivamente al verificarsi di tali inadempimenti. In ogni caso, la risoluzione della presente Licenza non pregiudicherà i diritti acquisiti da individui o enti che abbiano acquisito da Te Opere Derivate o Collezioni di Opere, ai sensi della presente Licenza, a condizione che tali individui o enti continuino a rispettare integralmente le licenze di cui sono parte. Le sezioni 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 rimangono valide in presenza di qualsiasi risoluzione della presente Licenza.
Sempre che vengano rispettati i termini e le condizioni di cui sopra, la presente Licenza è perpetua (e concessa per tutta la durata del diritto d'autore applicabile sull'Opera). Nonostante ciò, il Licenziante si riserva il diritto di rilasciare l'Opera sulla base dei termini di una differente licenza o di cessare la distribuzione dell'Opera in qualsiasi momento; fermo restando che, in ogni caso, tali decisioni non comporteranno recesso dalla presente Licenza (o da qualsiasi altra licenza che sia stata concessa, o che sia richiesto che venga concessa, ai termini della presente Licenza), e la presente Licenza continuerà ad avere piena efficacia, salvo che vi sia risoluzione come sopra indicato.
Art. 8 - Varie
Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti pubblicamente in forma digitale l'Opera o una Collezione di Opere, il Licenziante offre al destinatario una licenza per l'Opera nei medesimi termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi tramite la presente Licenza.
Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti pubblicamente in forma digitale un'Opera Derivata, il Licenziante offre al destinatario una licenza per l'Opera originaria nei medesimi termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi tramite la presente Licenza.
L'invalidità o l'inefficacia, secondo la legge applicabile, di una o più fra le disposizioni della presente Licenza, non comporterà l'invalidità o l'inefficacia dei restanti termini e, senza bisogno di ulteriori azioni delle parti, le disposizioni invalide o inefficaci saranno da intendersi rettificate nei limiti della misura che sia indispensabile per renderle valide ed efficaci.
In nessun caso i termini e le disposizioni di cui alla presente Licenza possono essere considerati rinunciati, né alcuna violazione può essere considerata consentita, salvo che tale rinuncia o consenso risultino per iscritto da una dichiarazione firmata dalla parte contro cui operi tale rinuncia o consenso.
La presente Licenza costituisce l'intero accordo tra le parti relativamente all'Opera qui data in licenza. Non esistono altre intese, accordi o dichiarazioni relative all'Opera che non siano quelle qui specificate. Il Licenziante non sarà vincolato ad alcuna altra disposizione addizionale che possa apparire in alcuna comunicazione da Te proveniente. La presente Licenza non può essere modificata senza il mutuo consenso scritto del Licenziante e Tuo.
La presente licenza è stata redatta sulla base della legge italiana, in particolare del Codice Civile del 1942 e della legge 22 Aprile 1941, n. 633 e successive modificazioni sulla protezione del diritto d'autore e di altri diritti connessi al suo esercizio.

1. Definities
'Verzamelwerk' een werk waarin het Werk, in zijn geheel en in ongewijzigde vorm, samen met een of meer andere werken, die elk een afzonderlijk en zelfstandig werk vormen, tot een geheel is samengevoegd. Voorbeelden van een verzamelwerk zijn een tijdschrift, een bloemlezing of een encyclopedie. Een Verzamelwerk zal voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk (als hieronder omschreven) worden beschouwd.
'Afgeleid werk' een werk dat is gebaseerd op het Werk of op het Werk en andere reeds bestaande werken. Voorbeelden van een Afgeleid werk zijn een vertaling, een muziekschikking (arrangement), een toneelbewerking, een literaire bewerking, een verfilming, een geluidsopname, een kunstreproductie, een verkorte versie, een samenvatting of enig andere bewerking van het Werk, met dien verstande dat een Verzamelwerk voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk zal worden beschouwd. Indien het Werk een muziekwerk betreft, zal de synchronisatie van de tijdslijnen van het Werk en een bewegend beeld ('synching') voor de toepassing van deze Licentie als een Afgeleid Werk worden beschouwd.
'Creative Commons compatibele licentie' een licentie die voorkomt op de lijst van licenties (beschikbaar op https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicences) die door Creative Commons aangemerkt worden als zijnde vrijwel gelijk aan deze Licentie en die in ieder geval de volgende bepalingen bevatten: (i) bepalingen met overeenkomstige doeleinden, betekenis en gevolgen als de Licentiebepalingen van deze Licentie; en (ii) bepalingen krachtens deze licentie die uitdrukkelijk ruimte bieden voor het herlicenseren van afgeleide werken van werken die beschikbaar zijn krachtens (a) die Licentie, (b) een (Unported) Creative Commons licentie of (c) een Creative Commons jurisdictie-licentie met overeenkomstige Licentie-elementen.

'Licentiegever' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/rechtspersonen die het Werk volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie aanbiedt/aanbieden.
'Maker' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/personen die het oorspronkelijke werk gemaakt heeft/hebben. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder de Maker mede verstaan de uitvoerende kunstenaar, film- en fonogramproducent en omroeporganisaties in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de producent van een databank in de zin van de Databankenwet.
'Werk' het auteursrechtelijk beschermde werk dat volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie wordt aangeboden. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder het Werk mede verstaan het fonogram, de eerste vastlegging van een film en het (omroep)programma in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de databank in de zin van de Databankenwet, voor zover dit fonogram, deze eerste vastlegging van een film, dit (omroep)programma en deze databank beschermd wordt krachtens de toepasselijke wet in de jurisdictie van de Gebruiker.
'Gebruiker' de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon die rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uitoefent en die de voorwaarden van deze Licentie met betrekking tot het Werk niet eerder geschonden heeft, of die van de Licentiegever uitdrukkelijke toestemming gekregen heeft om rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uit te oefenen ondanks een eerdere schending.
2. Beperkingen van de uitsluitende rechten. Niets in deze Licentie strekt ertoe om de rechten te beperken die voortvloeien uit de beperkingen en uitputting van de uitsluitende rechten van de rechthebbende krachtens het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het databankenrecht of enige andere toepasselijke rechten.
3. Licentieverlening. Met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie verleent de Licentiegever hierbij aan de Gebruiker een wereldwijde, niet-exclusieve licentie om de navolgende rechten met betrekking tot het Werk vrij van royalty's uit te oefenen voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten:
het reproduceren van het Werk, het opnemen van het Werk in een of meerdere Verzamelwerken, en het reproduceren van het in de Verzamelwerken opgenomen Werk;
het maken en reproduceren van Afgeleide werken met dien verstande dat met betrekking tot het Afgeleide werk, met inbegrip van welke vertaling in welk medium dan ook, duidelijk wordt gemaakt dat er wijzigingen in het oorspronkelijke Werk zijn aangebracht. Bijvoorbeeld, aan een vertaling kan worden toegevoegd dat 'het oorspronkelijke Werk is van het Engels in het Spaans vertaald', of in geval van een verandering kan worden aangegeven dat 'het oorspronkelijke werk is veranderd';
het verspreiden van exemplaren van het Werk, het in het openbaar tonen, op- en uitvoeren en het on-line beschikbaar stellen van het Werk, afzonderlijk en als deel van een Verzamelwerk;
het verspreiden van exemplaren van Afgeleide werken, het in het openbaar te tonen, op- en uitvoeren en het on-line beschikbaar stellen van Afgeleide werken;
het opvragen en hergebruiken van het Werk;
Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat:
Niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen. in het geval van niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot thuiskopieën) de Licentiegever zich het recht voorbehoudt om dergelijke heffingen te innen (al dan niet door middel van een auteursrechtenorganisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk;
Voor afstand vatbare heffingsregeling. in het geval van voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot leenrechten) de Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om dergelijke heffingen te innen bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk;
Collectief rechtenbeheer. de Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om vergoedingen te innen (zelfstandig of, indien de Licentiegever lid is van een auteursrechtenorganisatie, door middel van die organisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk.
De Gebruiker mag deze rechten uitoefenen met behulp van alle thans bekende media, dragers en formats. De Gebruiker is tevens gerechtigd om technische wijzigingen aan te brengen die noodzakelijk zijn om de rechten met behulp van andere media, dragers en formats uit te oefenen. Alle niet uitdrukkelijk verleende rechten zijn hierbij voorbehouden aan de Licentiegever, met inbegrip van maar niet beperkt tot de rechten die in artikel 4(e) worden genoemd. Voor zover de Licentiegever op basis van het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn over uitsluitende rechten beschickt doet de Licentiegever afstand van deze rechten.
4. Beperkingen. De in artikel 3 verleende Licentie is uitdrukkelijk gebonden aan de volgende beperkingen:
De Gebruiker mag het Werk uitsluitend verspreiden, in het openbaar tonen, op- of uitvoeren of on-line beschikbaar stellen met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie, en de Gebruiker dient een exemplaar van, of de Uniform Resource Identifier voor, deze Licentie toe te voegen aan elk exemplaar van het Werk dat de Gebruiker verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert, of on-line beschikbaar stelt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk onder enige afwijkende voorwaarden aan te bieden waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk in sublicentie te geven. De Gebruiker dient alle vermeldingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie dan wel naar de uitsluiting van garantie te laten staan. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk te verspreiden, in het openbaar te tonen, op- of uit te voeren of on-line beschikbaar te stellen met toepassing van technologische voorzieningen waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het voorgaande is tevens van toepassing op het Werk dat deel uitmaakt van een Verzamelwerk, maar dat houdt niet in dat het Verzamelwerk, afgezien van het Werk zelf, gebonden is aan de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. Indien de Gebruiker een Verzamelwerk maakt, dient deze, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, de op grond van artikel 4(c) vereiste naamsvermelding uit het Verzamelwerk te verwijderen, voor zover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek. Indien de Gebruiker een Afgeleid werk maakt, dient hij, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, de op grond van artikel 4(c) vereiste naamsvermelding uit het Afgeleide werk te verwijderen, voorzover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek.
De Gebruiker mag het Afgeleide werk uitsluitend verspreiden, in het openbaar tonen, op- of uitvoeren of on-line beschikbaar stellen met inachtneming van (i) de voorwaarden van deze Licentie; (ii) een latere versie van deze Licentie met overeenkomstige Licentie-elementen; (iii) de (Unported) Creative Commons Licentie of een Creative Commons jurisdictie-licentie (deze versie of een latere versie) met overeenkomstige Licentie-elementen (bv. een Naamsvermelding-GelijkDelen Licentie 3.0 (VS)) ('Toepasbare licentie'); (iv) een Creative Commons compatibele licentie. Indien de Gebruiker het Afgeleide werk in licentie geeft krachtens een van de onder (iv) genoemde licenties, dient de Gebruiker te voldoen aan de bepalingen van die licentie. Indien de Gebruiker het Afgeleide werk in licentie geeft krachtens de bepalingen van een van de onder (i), (ii) of (iii) genoemde licenties ('Toepasbare licentie'), dient de Gebruiker te voldoen aan de bepalingen van de Toepasbare licentie en aan de volgende voorwaarden: (I) De Gebruiker dient een exemplaar van, of de Uniform Resource Identifier voor, de Toepasbare licentie toe te voegen aan elk exemplaar of elke geluidsopname van het Afgeleide werk dat de Gebruiker verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert, of on-line beschikbaar stelt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om de Afgeleide werken onder enige afwijkende voorwaarden aan te bieden waardoor de voorwaarden van de Toepasbare licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers om de rechten krachtens de Toepasbare licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. De Gebruiker dient alle vermeldingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie dan wel naar de uitsluiting van garantie te laten staan. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om de Afgeleide werken te verspreiden, in het openbaar te tonen, op of uit te voeren of on-line beschikbaar te stellen met toepassing van technologische voorzieningen waardoor de voorwaarden van de Toepasbare licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van de Afgeleide werken om de rechten krachtens de Toepasbare licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het voorgaande is tevens van toepassing op het Afgeleide werk dat deel uitmaakt van een Verzamelwerk, maar dat houdt niet in dat het Verzamelwerk, afgezien van het Afgeleide werk zelf, gebonden is aan de voorwaarden van de Toepasbare licentie.
Indien de Gebruiker het Werk, Afgeleide Werken of Verzamelwerken verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert of on-line beschikbaar stelt, dient de Gebruiker, tenzij er sprake is van een verzoek als vermeld in lid 4(a), alle auteursrechtvermeldingen met betrekking tot het Werk te laten staan. Tevens dient de Gebruiker, op een wijze die redelijk is in verhouding tot het gebruikte medium, de naam te vermelden van (i) de Maker (of zijn/haar pseudoniem indien van toepassing) indien deze wordt vermeld; en/of (ii) van (een) andere partij(en) (b.v. sponsor, uitgeverij, tijdschrift) indien de naamsvermelding van deze partij(en) ("Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden") in de auteursrechtvermelding of algemene voorwaarden van de Licentiegever of op een andere redelijke wijze verplicht is gesteld door de Maker en/of de Licentiegever; de titel van het Werk indien deze wordt vermeld; voorzover redelijkerwijs toepasbaar de Uniform Resource Identifier, indien aanwezig, waarvan de Licentiegever heeft aangegeven dat deze bij het Werk hoort, tenzij de URI niet verwijst naar de auteursrechtvermeldingen of de licentie-informatie betreffende het Werk; in overeenstemming met artikel 3(b) in geval van een Afgeleid werk, door te verwijzen naar het gebruik van het Werk in het Afgeleide werk (bijvoorbeeld: 'De Franse vertaling van het Werk van de Maker' of 'Scenario gebaseerd op het Werk van de Maker'). De Gebruiker dient op redelijke wijze aan de in dit artikel genoemde vereisten te voldoen; echter, met dien verstande dat, in geval van een Afgeleid werk of een Verzamelwerk, de naamsvermeldingen in ieder geval geplaatst dienen te worden, indien er een naamsvermelding van alle makers van het Afgeleide werk of het Verzamelwerk geplaatst wordt dan als deel van die naamsvermeldingen, en op een wijze die in ieder geval even duidelijk is als de naamsvermeldingen van de overige makers.

4. Restrições. A licença concedida na Secção 3 supra está expressamente sujeita e limitada pelas seguintes restrições:
O Utilizador apenas pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho sob os termos desta Licença. O Utilizador deve incluir, em cada cópia do Trabalho que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, uma cópia desta Licença ou o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI). O Utilizador não pode propor ou impor quaisquer termos que alterem ou restrinjam os termos desta Licença ou o exercício, por parte do destinatário, dos direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. O Utilizador não pode sub-licenciar o Trabalho. O Utilizador deve manter intactas, em cada cópia do Trabalho que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, todos os avisos que se referem a esta Licença e à exclusão de garantias. O Utilizador não pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público nenhuma cópia do Trabalho com qualquer medida tecnológica que restrinja a possibilidade do destinatário exercer os direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. Esta Secção 4(a) aplica-se ao Trabalho quando incorporado em Coleções, mas isto não requer que a Coleção, independente do próprio Trabalho, esteja sujeita aos termos desta Licença. Se o Utilizador criar uma Coleção ou um Trabalho Derivado e for notificado pelo Licenciante para remover da Coleção ou do Trabalho Derivado qualquer crédito inserido em conformidade com o estipulado na Secção 4(c), deve, na medida do razoável, agir de acordo com o solicitado.
O Utilizador apenas pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público Trabalhos Derivados sob os termos (i) desta Licença, (ii) de uma versão posterior desta Licença que contenha os mesmos Elementos da Licença que a presente Licença, (iii) de uma licença Creative Commons Unported ou de Jurisdição (seja a versão atual ou uma versão posterior) que contenha os mesmos Elementos da Licença que a presente Licença (por exemplo: Atribuição – CompartilhaIgual 3.0 Espanha), ou (iv) de uma Licença Compatível Creative Commons. Se o Utilizador licenciar o Trabalho Derivado sob os termos de uma das licenças mencionadas em (iv), deve cumprir com os termos dessa licença. Se o Utilizador licenciar o Trabalho Derivado sob os termos de qualquer uma das licenças mencionadas em (i), (ii) ou (iii) (“Licença Aplicável”), deve cumprir com os termos da Licença Aplicável em geral e com as seguintes disposições: (I) O Utilizador deve incluir, em cada cópia do Trabalho Derivado que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, uma cópia da Licença Aplicável ou o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI); (II) O Utilizador não pode propor ou impor quaisquer termos que alterem ou restrinjam os termos da Licença Aplicável ou o exercício, por parte do destinatário do Trabalho Derivado, dos direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos da Licença Aplicável; (III) O Utilizador deve manter intactas, em cada cópia do Trabalho Derivado que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, todas as informações que se referem à Licença Aplicável e à exclusão de garantias; (IV) O Utilizador não pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público nenhuma cópia do Trabalho Derivado com qualquer medida tecnológica que restrinja a possibilidade do destinatário do Trabalho Derivado exercer os direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos da Licença Aplicável. Esta Secção 4(b) aplica-se ao Trabalho Derivado quando incorporado em Coleções, mas isto não requer que a Coleção, independente do próprio Trabalho Derivado, esteja sujeita aos termos da Licença Aplicável.
Se o Utilizador Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho ou qualquer Trabalho Derivado ou Coleção, deve – a menos que o Licenciante o tenha notificado em sentido contrário nos termos da Secção 4(a) parte final – manter intactos todos os avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, e exibir, de forma razoável em relação ao meio ou meios por si empregues: (i) o nome ou o pseudónimo, se fornecidos, do Titular Originário, nos avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, nos termos de serviço ou através de outros meios razoáveis; e/ou (ii) o nome da parte ou partes (por exemplo, um instituto, uma editora, uma revista) que o Titular Originário e/ou o Licenciante tiverem designado para atribuição (“Partes de Atribuição”), nos avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, nos termos de serviço ou através de outros meios razoáveis; e (iii) o título do Trabalho, se fornecido; e (iv) o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante tenha especificado para estar associado ao Trabalho, se o houver, exceto se o URI não disser respeito ao aviso referente ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento do Trabalho; e (v) no caso de Trabalho Derivado, em conformidade com a Secção 3(b), um crédito identificando a transformação do Trabalho num Trabalho Derivado (por exemplo: "Tradução Portuguesa da Obra original do Autor” ou "Guião baseado na Obra original do Autor"). Os créditos exigidos por esta Secção 4(c) podem ser implementados de qualquer forma, desde que razoável. No caso de um Trabalho Derivado ou Coleção, exibindo-se os créditos de todos os autores participantes do Trabalho Derivado ou Coleção, os créditos ora exigidos devem fazer parte daqueles e devem aparecer de modo pelo menos tão proeminente quanto os créditos dados aos demais autores participantes. De modo a evitar dúvidas, o Utilizador apenas poderá fazer uso dos créditos exigidos por esta Secção 4(c) para o propósito de atribuição na forma estabelecida acima. Ao exercer os seus direitos sob esta Licença, o Utilizador não poderá implícita ou explicitamente afirmar ou sugerir qualquer vínculo, patrocínio ou apoio do Titular Originário, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição a si ou ao seu uso do Trabalho, a menos que tenha obtido prévia e expressamente autorização daqueles.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se que as restrições acima mencionadas [4(a), 4(b) e 4(c)] não se aplicam àquelas partes do Trabalho que apenas sejam protegidas pelo direito especial do fabricante de base de dados previsto no art. 12.º do Decreto-Lei n.º 122/2000 de 4 de Julho, que implementou para a ordem jurídica portuguesa a Diretiva n.º 96/9/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 11 de Março, relativa à proteção jurídica de bases de dados.
Nada nesta Licença poderá afetar quaisquer dos direitos morais assegurados ao Autor ou ao Artista pela Legislação Aplicável, incluindo, sem limitação, o direito de oposição a toda e qualquer mutilação, deformação ou outra modificação do Trabalho e, de um modo geral, a todo e qualquer ato que a desvirtue e possa afetar a honra e reputação do Autor ou do Artista.

EXCETO QUANDO EXPRESSAMENTE ACORDADO PELAS PARTES POR ESCRITO EM SENTIDO CONTRÁRIO E NA MEDIDA PERMITIDA PELA LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL, O LICENCIANTE DISPONIBILIZA O TRABALHO “NO ESTADO EM QUE SE ENCONTRA” (“AS-IS BASIS”), E NÃO FAZ QUAISQUER DECLARAÇÕES OU PRESTA GARANTIAS DE QUALQUER TIPO EM RELAÇÃO AO TRABALHO, SEJAM EXPRESSAS OU IMPLÍCITAS, LEGAIS OU OUTRAS, INCLUINDO, SEM LIMITAÇÃO, QUAISQUER GARANTIAS SOBRE A TITULARIDADE DO TRABALHO, POTENCIALIDADE COMERCIAL, ADEQUAÇÃO A UM FIM ESPECÍFICO, LEGALIDADE, AUSÊNCIA DE DEFEITOS LATENTES OU OUTROS, EXATIDÃO, EXISTÊNCIA OU AUSÊNCIA DE ERROS, SEJAM ELES APARENTES OU OCULTOS. ALGUMAS JURISDIÇÕES NÃO ADMITEM A EXCLUSÃO DE GARANTIAS IMPLÍCITAS, PELO QUE TAL EXCLUSÃO PODERÁ NÃO SER APLICÁVEL AO UTILIZADOR.
6. Limitação de Responsabilidade. EXCETO NA EXTENSÃO EXIGIDA PELA LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL, EM NENHUMA CIRCUNSTÂNCIA O LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PARA COM O UTILIZADOR, COM BASE EM NENHUMA TEORIA JURÍDICA, POR QUAISQUER DANOS, GERAIS OU ESPECIAIS (INCLUINDO DANOS EMERGENTES E LUCROS CESSANTES), INCIDENTAIS OU CONSEQUENCIAIS, PUNITIVOS OU EXEMPLARES, QUE RESULTEM DA PRESENTE LICENÇA OU DA UTILIZAÇÃO DO TRABALHO, AINDA QUE O LICENCIANTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO SOBRE A POSSIBILIDADE DE OCORRÊNCIA DE TAIS DANOS.
7. Cessação
A presente Licença e os direitos concedidos pela mesma cessarão automaticamente em caso de qualquer violação dos termos desta Licença pelo Utilizador. Os indivíduos ou entidades que tenham recebido do Utilizador Trabalhos Derivados ou Coleções sob esta Licença, não terão, no entanto, as suas licenças cessadas, se permanecerem em total cumprimento com os termos dessas licenças. As Secções 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 subsistirão a qualquer cessação desta Licença.
Sujeita aos termos e condições acima expostos, a presente Licença é válida pelo período de duração do direito de autor ou do direito conexo aplicável ao Trabalho previsto na Legislação Aplicável. Sem prejuízo do disposto na frase anterior, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito de divulgar ou publicar o Trabalho sob termos e condições de licenciamento diferentes dos da presente Licença, ou de deixar, a qualquer momento, de Distribuir o Trabalho; desde que, no entanto, quaisquer dessas ações não sirva como meio de fazer cessar esta Licença (ou qualquer outra licença que tenha sido ou que deva ser concedida sob os termos desta Licença), a qual continuará plenamente válida e eficaz, a não ser que seja terminada de acordo com o acima disposto.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se que nada no disposto nas Secções 7(a) 7(b) poderá afetar o direito moral de retirada de circulação da obra literária ou artística assegurado ao Autor pela Legislação Aplicável, o qual só poderá, no entanto, ser exercido sob os termos e condições previstos nessa Legislação.
8. Outras Disposições
Cada vez que o Utilizador distribua ou apresente ao público o Trabalho, ou uma Coleção, o Licenciante concederá ao destinatário uma licença de utilização do Trabalho objeto desta Licença com os mesmos termos e condições que foram concedidos ao Utilizador sob a presente Licença.

Creative Commons Cod Juridic
Atribuire–Distribuire în Condiţii Identice 3.0 România
 
Organizaţia Creative Commons (denumită în continuare „Creative Commons”) nu este o firmă de avocatură şi nu acordă servicii de asistenţă juridică. Distribuirea acestei licenţe nu creează o relaţie de tip Avocat-Client. Creative Commons oferă această formă de licenţă, aşa cum este aceasta prezentată în cele ce urmează. Creative Commons nu îşi asumă răspunderea pentru daunele rezultate din conţinutul sau utilizarea acestei licenţe.
Licenţa
Opera (aşa cum este definită mai jos) este furnizată în condiţiile acestei Licenţe Publice Creative Commons (denumită în continuare „LPCC” sau „licenţă”). Opera este protejată de legea privind drepturile de autor şi drepturile conexe şi de celelalte norme de drept aplicabile. Orice utilizare a Operei în afara celei autorizate prin această licenţă sau prin legislaţia în vigoare este interzisă.
Exercitarea oricăror drepturi prevăzute de prezenta licenţă asupra Operei presupune acceptarea licenţei. Conform termenilor şi obligaţiilor din prezenta licenţă, în măsura în care prezenta licenţă poate fi considerată un contract, Licenţiatorul propune Licenţiatului exercitarea drepturilor menţionate mai jos, iar Licenţiatul este de acord cu termenii şi condiţiile licenţei.
1. Definiţii
"Opera" desemnează opera originală de creaţie intelectuală susceptibilă de protecţie prin dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe, furnizată în condiţiile prezenţei licenţe. În cadrul acestei licenţe, prin Operă se înţelege şi o fonogramă (culegere de opere fixate pe fonogramă), o videogramă (culegere de opere fixate pe o videogramă), un program de radiodifuziune ori de televiziune, precum şi o bază de date în conformitate cu definiţiile din legislaţia în vigoare privind drepturile de autor şi drepturile conexe, cu condiţia ca o asemenea fonogramă, videogramă, program de radiodifuziune ori de televiziune sau bază de date să fie protejate de legea aplicabilă.
"Adaptare" desemnează o Operă creată pe baza unei alte Opere sau pe baza unei Opere şi a unor alte Opere preexistente, aşa cum sunt traducerile, adaptările, operele derivate, aranjamentele muzicale sau alte alterări ale unor opere literare sau artistice sau ale unor fonograme sau comunicări publice, incluzând adaptările cinematografice sau orice alte adaptări prin care Opera poate fi modificată, transformată sau adaptată, incluzând, în orice formă, părţi uşor de recunoscut ale originalului. Fac excepţie Colecţiile, care nu vor fi considerate Adaptări potrivit scopului prezentei licenţe. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, atunci când Opera este o creaţie muzicală, interpretare muzicală sau fonogramă, sincronizarea acesteia în relaţie temporală cu o imagine aflată în mişcare ("sincronizare") va fi considerată Adaptare potrivit prezentei licenţe.
"Colecţie" desemnează un cumul de Opere literare sau artistice, aşa cum sunt enciclopediile şi antologiile, precum şi orice alte Opere sau subiecte, altele decât Operele enumerate la articolul 1 litera (a). Acestea, prin selecţia şi aranjamentul conţinutului lor, constituie creaţii intelectuale în care o Operă este inclusă în integralitatea ei în noua Operă, alături de una sau mai multe contribuţii, fiecare reprezentând Opere separate şi independente, care împreună dobândesc o formă colectivă. În sensul acestui contract, o Operă care constituie o Colecţie nu va fi considerată Adaptare.
"Autorul" desemnează, în cazul unei Opere literare sau artistice, persoana sau persoanele fizice care au creat Opera.
"Titularul de drepturi conexe" desemnează persoana fizică sau juridică, titular de drepturi conexe dreptului de autor, care poate fi: (i) artisti interpret sau executant, în cazul execuţiei sau interpretării; (ii) producător de înregistrări sonore şi de înregistrări audiovizuale, în cazul unei fonograme sau respectiv videograme; sau (iii) organism de radiodifuziune şi televiziune, în cazul programelor de radiodifuziune şi televiziune. În cadrul acestei licenţe, prin titular de drepturi conexe se va înţelege şi fabricantul unei baze de date.
"Licenţiatorul" desemnează persoana sau persoanele fizice şi/sau juridice care pun la dispoziţie Opera, în condiţiile prezentei licenţe.
"Licenţiatul" desemnează persoana fizică şi/sau persoana juridică care acceptă prezenta licenţă şi exercită drepturile acordate, fără să fi încălcat în prealabil termenii licenţei, sau care a primit permisiunea expresă a Licenţiatorului de a exercita drepturile conferite prin prezenta licenţă, în pofida unei încălcări anterioare a prevederilor acesteia.
"Comunicare publică" desemnează orice comunicare a unei Opere, realizată direct sau prin orice mijloace tehnice, făcută într-un loc accesibil publicului sau în orice loc în care se adună un număr de persoane care depăşeşte cercul normal al membrilor unei familii şi al cunoştinţelor acesteia, inclusiv reprezentarea scenică, recitarea sau orice altă modalitate publică de execuţie ori de prezentare directă a Operei, expunerea publică a Operelor de artă plastică, de artă aplicată, fotografică şi de arhitectură, proiecţia publică a Operelor cinematografice şi a altor Opere audiovizuale, inclusiv a Operelor de artă digitală, prezentarea într-un loc public, prin intermediul înregistrărilor sonore sau audiovizuale, precum şi prezentarea într-un loc public, prin intermediul oricăror mijloace, a unei Opere radiodifuzate. De asemenea, se consideră publică orice comunicare a unei Opere, prin mijloace cu fir sau fără fir, realizată prin punerea la dispoziţia publicului, inclusiv prin Internet sau alte reţele de calculatoare, astfel încât oricare dintre membrii publicului să poată avea acces la aceasta din orice loc sau în orice moment ales în mod individual.
"Distribuire" desemnează orice mod de transmitere a originalului sau a copiilor unei Opere sau Adaptări, precum şi oferirea publică a acestora.
"Reproducere" desemnează realizarea, integrală sau parţială, a uneia ori a mai multor copii ale unei Opere, direct sau indirect, temporar ori permanent, prin orice mijloc şi sub orice formă, inclusiv realizarea oricărei înregistrări sonore sau audiovizuale a unei Opere, precum şi stocarea permanentă ori temporară a acesteia prin mijloace electronice.
"Opţiunile licenţei" desemnează următoarele atribute importante ale licenţei, aşa cum au fost acestea selectate de către Licenţiator şi cum sunt indicate în titlul prezentei licenţe: Atribuire–Distribuire în Condiţii Identice.
„Licenţă compatibilă Creative Commons”desemnează o licenţă care este publicată la https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses şi care a fost aprobată de Creative Commons ca fiind în fond echivalentă cu această licenţă pentru ca acea licenţă: (i) conţine termeni care au acelasi scop, semnificaţie şi efect ca şi Opţiunile acestei licenţe; şi, (ii) permite în mod explicit relicenţierea, sub această licenţă sau o licenţă Creative Commons din altă jurisdicţie cu aceleaşi Opţiuni ca şi prezenta, a adaptărilor operelor făcute publice sub acea licenţă.
2. Limitele exercitării dreptului de autor. Nicio prevedere a acestei licenţe nu are scopul de a reduce, de a limita sau de a restrânge drepturile rezultate din aplicarea normelor legale cu privire la limitele exercitării dreptului de autor prevăzute de legislaţia privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe sau de alte legi aplicabile.
3. Autorizare. În condiţiile definite prin prezenta licenţă şi pe întreaga durată de protecţie a Operei prevăzută de legislaţia privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe, Licenţiatorul acordă Licenţiatului în mod neexclusiv, nelimitat teritorial şi cu titlu gratuit autorizarea de a exercita următoarele drepturi:
dreptul de a reproduce Opera, de a o încorpora într-una sau mai multe Colecţii şi de a reproduce Opera aşa cum a fost aceasta încorporată într-o Colecţie;
dreptul de a crea şi de a reproduce Adaptări;
dreptul de a distribui şi comunica public Opera, inclusiv încorporată în Colecţii;
dreptul de a distribui şi comunica public Adaptări;
în cazul în care opera este o bază de date, dreptul de a extrage şi/sau a reutiliza părţi substanţiale din Operă;
Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, trebuie să notam:  
Regim legal obligatoriu de gestiune colectivă. În cazul în care un tip de utilizare a Operei ar fi supus unui regim legal obligatoriu de gestiune colectivă (de ex. dreptul la remuneraţie compensatorie pentru copia privată), Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul exclusiv de a colecta remuneraţiile respective prin intermediul organismului de gestiune colectivă competent, atât în cazul utilizării comerciale, cât şi în cazul utilizării necomerciale a Operei;
Regim legal facultativ de gestiune colectivă. În cazul în care un tip de utilizare a Operei ar fi supus unui regim legal facultativ de gestiune colectivă (de ex. dreptul de împrumut), Licenţiatorul renunţă la dreptul de a colecta aceste remuneraţii pentru orice exercitare de către Licenţiat a drepturilor obţinute prin prezenta licenţă;
Gestiunea colectivă a drepturilor. Licenţiatorul renunţă, acolo unde legea permite, la dreptul de a colecta remuneraţiile (independent sau, când Licenţiatorul este un membru al unui organism de gestiune colectivă, prin acesta) pentru orice exercitare de către Licenţiat a drepturilor obţinute prin prezenta licenţă.
Drepturile menţionate mai sus pot fi exercitate în cazul tuturor mediilor de stocare şi formatelor cunoscute. Drepturile menţionate mai sus includ şi dreptul de a face modificările tehnice corespunzătoare necesare exercitării acestora în cazul altor medii de stocare sau formate. Toate drepturile care nu sunt expres acordate de Licenţiator sau asupra cărora Licenţiatorul nu are dreptul de gestiune rămân rezervate, în special în cazurile de gestiune colectivă obligatorie aplicabile menţionate la articolul 4 litera (d). Daca Licenţiatorul este titularul drepturilor sui-generis asupra unei baze de date, în conformitate cu legea naţională care implementează Directiva Europeană privind Bazele de Date, Licenţiatorul va renunţa la aceste drepturi.
4. Restricţii. Licenţa, acordată în conformitate cu articolul 3, se încheie sub condiţia respectării următoarelor restricţii:
Licenţiatul poate distribui sau comunica public Opera numai în condiţiile prezentei licenţe. Licenţiatul este obligat să includă o copie a licenţei sau adresa acesteia pe Internet (U.R.I. - Uniform Resource Identifier) împreună cu fiecare copie a Operei care este distribuită sau comunicată public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a oferi sau impune nicio condiţie asupra Operei, care să modifice sau să restricţioneze prevederile acestei licenţe sau exercitarea drepturilor terţilor dobânditori, aşa cum sunt acestea prevăzute în prezenta licenţă. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a sublicenţia Opera. Licenţiatul este obligat să păstreze intacte toate notificările care se referă la prezenta licenţă şi la exonerarea de răspundere din fiecare copie a Operei pe care o distribuie sau comunică public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a distribui sau de a comunica public Opera folosind măsuri tehnice de protecţie care restrâng posibilitatea terţilor dobânditori de a-şi exercita drepturile obţinute în condiţiile prezentei licenţe. Prezenta literă (a) se aplică Operei încorporate într-o Colecţie, dar nu se extinde în mod obligatoriu asupra celorlalte Opere conţinute în Colecţie. Dacă Licenţiatul creează o Colecţie, acesta este obligat, la notificarea oricărui Licenţiator, în măsura în care este posibil, să înlăture din Colecţie orice referinţă la respectivul Licenţiator, la Titularul de drepturi conexe sau la Autorul Operei, astfel cum se specifică la articolul 4 litera (c). Dacă Licenţiatul creează o Adaptare, acesta este obligat, la notificarea oricărui Licenţiator, în măsura în care este posibil, să înlăture din Adaptare orice referinţă la respectivul Licenţiator, la Titularul de drepturi conexe sau la Autorul Operei , astfel cum se specifică la articolul 4 litera (c).
Licenţiatul poate distribui sau comunica public o Adaptare numai cu respectarea Licenţei Aplicabile, care poate fi: (i) această licenţă; sau (ii) o versiune ulterioară a acestei licenţe având aceleaşi Opţiuni; (iii) o licenţă Creative Commons (prezenta sau o versiune ulterioară a prezentei) dintr-o altă jurisdicţie sau versiunea Ne-adaptată, care conţine aceleaşi Opţiuni ca această licenţă (ex. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 SUA); sau (iv) o Licenţă Compatibilă Creative Commons. Dacă Licenţiatul licenţiează Adaptarea printr-una din licenţele menţionate la punctul (iv), acesta trebuie să se îndeplinească termenii acelei licenţe. În cazul în care Licenţiatul licenţiează Adaptarea printr-una din licenţele menţionate la punctele (i), (ii) sau (iii), aceasta este obligat să includă o copie a Licenţei Aplicabile sau adresa pe Internet (U.R.I.) împreună cu fiecare copie a fiecărei Adaptări pe care o distribuie sau o comunică public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a oferi sau impune nicio condiţie asupra Adaptării care să modifice sau să restricţioneze prevederile Licenţei Aplicabile sau exercitarea drepturilor terţilor dobânditori, astfel cum sunt acestea prevăzute de Licenţa Aplicabilă. Licenţiatul este obligat să păstreze intacte toate notificările care se referă la Licenţa Aplicabilă şi la exonerarea de răspundere cu fiecare copie a Operei incluse în Adaptarea pe care o distribuie sau o comunică public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a distribui sau de a comunica public Adaptarea folosind măsuri tehnice de protecţie care restrâng posibilitatea terţilor dobânditori de a-şi exercita drepturile asupra Adaptării în condiţiile Licenţei Aplicabile. Prezenta literă (b) se aplică şi Adaptării încorporate într-o Colecţie, dar nu se extinde în mod obligatoriu asupra celorlalte Opere conţinute în Colecţie.
În cazul în care Licenţiatul distribuie sau comunică public Opera sau orice Adaptare sau Colecţie, Licenţiatul este obligat, cu excepţia cererilor făcute în baza articolului 4 litera (a), să păstreze intacte toate informaţiile sau notificările privind drepturile de autor sau conexe asupra Operei şi să furnizeze următoarele informaţii, în funcţie de mediul sau mijloacele utilizate: (i) numele Autorului şi/sau al Titularului de drepturi conexe (sau pseudonimul, după caz), dacă acesta a fost adus la cunoştinţă, şi/sau numele părţii desemnate de Autor, Titular de Drepturi Conexe şi/sau de Licenţiator pentru atribuirea Operei, în notificările Licenţiatorului privind drepturile de autor, condiţiile de utilizare sau alte menţiuni disponibile; (ii) titlul Operei, dacă este furnizat; (iii) în măsura în care este posibil şi dacă există, adresa pe Internet (U.R.I.) pe care Licenţiatorul o desemnează pentru a fi asociată cu Opera, cu excepţia cazului în care această adresă nu se referă la informaţiile privind paternitatea Operei şi condiţiile de utilizare a Operei; şi (iv) în conformitate cu articolul 3 litera (b), în cazul unei Adaptări, o menţiune care să identifice utilizarea Operei în Adaptare (de ex. „traducere în limba romană a Operei Autorului” sau „scenariu bazat pe Opera originală a Autorului”). Menţiunea cerută la prezenta literă (d) poate fi introdusă în orice modalitate adecvată; cu toate acestea, în cazul unei Adaptări sau Colecţii, dacă apar menţiuni similare pentru toţi Autorii care contribuie la Adaptare sau Colecţie, cel puţin o astfel de menţiune este necesar a fi introdusă alături de celelalte menţiuni şi în aceeaşi măsură ca pentru ceilalţi Autori. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, Licenţiatul poate folosi menţiunea cerută în această secţiune doar în scopul atribuirii în modalitatea prevăzută anterior, iar în scopul exercitării drepturilor în condiţiile prezentei licenţe, Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a susţine sau a sugera, direct sau indirect, orice legătură, finanţare sau susţinere din partea Autorului, Titularului de Drepturi Conexe, Licenţiatorului şi/sau părţii desemnate de aceştia pentru atribuire, după caz, pentru Licenţiat sau utilizarea Operei de către Licenţiat, cu excepţia permisiunilor separate, exprese, acordate în scris şi anterior de către Autor, Titularul de drepturi conexe, Licenţiator şi/sau partea desemnată de aceştia pentru atribuire.
Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri: Restricţiile menţionate la literele (a), (b) şi (c) nu se aplică acelor Opere care îndeplinesc doar criteriul dreptului sui generis asupra unei baze de date în conformitate cu legea română privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe.
Drepturile morale rămân nemodificate, în măsura în care sunt recunoscute şi nu pot face obliectul unor renunţări în conformitate cu legea aplicabilă.
5. Garanţie şi exonerarea de răspundere 
Prin punerea Operei la dispoziţia publicului în conformitate cu dispoziţiile prezentei licenţe, Licenţiatorul declară de bună credinţă că, în conformitate cu ceea ce cunoaşte şi în limite rezonabile:  
Licenţiatorul a obţinut toate drepturile necesare asupra Operei pentru a putea autoriza exerciţiul drepturilor acordate prin prezenta licenţă şi a permite utilizarea netulburată şi exerciţiul licit al acestor drepturi, aceasta fără ca Licenţiatul să aibă o obligaţie de a plăti vreo remuneraţie, cu excepţia celor prevăzute de mecanismele de gestiune colectivă obligatorie descrise la articolul 3 litera (f);
Opera nu dă naştere vreunei încălcări a drepturilor unor terţe persoane, în special drepturi de autor sau drepturi conexe, drepturi privind mărcile, drepturi privind informaţia, drepturi patrimoniale sau oricare alte drepturi, şi nici vreunei defăimări, violări a dreptului la viaţa privată sau vreunui alt fapt ilicit cu privire la oricare altă terţă parte.
Cu excepţia cazurilor prevăzute expres în prezenta licenţă sau într-un alt acord scris, sau cerute de legea aplicabilă, Opera este pusă la dispoziţie fără vreo garanţie de orice fel, expresă sau tacită, inclusiv în ceea ce priveşte conţinutul Operei sau exactitatea acesteia.
6. Limitarea răspunderii. Cu excepţia răspunderii cerută de normele imperative ale legii aplicabile şi a reparării prejudiciilor impuse de răspunderea faţă de terţi generată de încălcarea garanţiilor prevăzute la articolul 5, Licenţiatorul nu va fi responsabil faţa de Licenţiat, în temeiul niciunei doctrine juridice, pentru orice prejudicii directe, indirecte, materiale sau morale care decurg din această licenţă sau din utilizarea Operei, chiar dacă Licenţiatorul a fost avertizat asupra posibilităţii producerii unor asemenea prejudicii.
7. Rezilierea licenţei
Această licenţă este reziliată de plin drept, iar drepturile acordate prin intermediul său vor înceta în mod implicit în cazul în care Licenţiatul săvârşeşte orice fel de încălcare a condiţiilor licenţei. Licenţele prin care persoane fizice sau persoane juridice au dobândit de la Licenţiat Adaptări sau Colecţii, în condiţiile acestei licenţe, nu vor fi reziliate, atât timp cât respectivii dobânditori vor respecta condiţiile sub care le-au fost acordate drepturile respective. Articolele 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 şi 8 rămân aplicabile chiar după rezilierea prezentei licenţe.
În limitele indicate mai sus, prezenta licenţă se aplică pe întreaga durată de protecţie a Operei conform legii aplicabile. Cu toate acestea, Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul de a exploata Opera şi în alte condiţii contractuale sau de a înceta oricând distribuirea Operei; totuşi, utilizarea acestei opţiuni a Licenţiatorului nu va conduce la restrângerea efectelor prezentei licenţe (sau a oricărei alte licenţe care a fost sau trebuie să fie acordată conform condiţiilor prezentei licenţe), iar licenţa va continua să producă efecte depline, până la rezilierea sa în baza prevederilor menţionate mai sus.
8. Alte prevederi
Cu fiecare reproducere sau comunicare publică în format digital de către Licenţiat a Operei sau a unei Colecţii, Licenţiatorul face primitorului o ofertă de licenţă având ca obiect Opera, conţinând aceleaşi condiţii ca şi prezenta licenţă încheiată cu Licenţiatul.
Cu fiecare reproducere sau comunicare publică în format digital de către Licenţiat a Adaptării, Licenţiatorul face primitorului o ofertă de licenţă având ca obiect Opera originală, conţinând aceleaşi condiţii ca şi prezenta licenţă încheiată cu Licenţiatul.
Dacă o prevedere a prezentei licenţe este nulă sau inaplicabilă conform legislaţiei în vigoare, validitatea sau aplicabilitatea celorlalte dispoziţii ale licenţei nu va fi afectată. Fără a fi necesare alte acţiuni ale părţilor la prezenta licenţă, prevederile nule sau inaplicabile vor fi interpretate în măsura minimă necesară pentru a deveni valide şi aplicabile.
Nu se va considera că s-a renunţat la vreo prevedere a prezentei licenţe sau la invocarea încălcării acesteia, cu excepţia cazului în care o astfel de renunţare este în scris şi semnată de partea care suportă consecinţele renunţării sau invocării încălcării.
Prezenta licenţă constituie convenţia părţilor în întregul său asupra Operei astfel licenţiate. Nu există alte înţelegeri, acorduri sau dispoziţii privind Opera care să nu fie specificate prin prezenta licenţă. Licenţiatorul nu va fi subiect al niciunei dispoziţii suplimentare comunicate de către Licenţiat. Prezenta licenţă nu poate fi modificată fără acordul mutual scris al Licenţiatorului şi al Licenţiatului.
Dreptul aplicabil este dreptul român.
Notă privind Creative Commons
Creative Commons nu este parte a prezentei licenţe şi nu acordă nicio garanţie legată de Operă. Creative Commons nu este răspunzătoare faţă de Licenţiat sau faţă de orice altă persoană, în conformitate cu nicio doctrină juridică, pentru niciun fel de prejudicii, inclusiv, cu titlu exemplificativ, pentru orice prejudicii directe, indirecte, materiale sau morale produse în legătură cu prezenta licenţă. Prin excepţie de la cele două teze anterioare, dacă Creative Commons s-a identificat în mod expres ca fiind Licenţiator în accepţiunea prezentei licenţe, atunci va avea toate drepturile şi obligaţiile Licenţiatorului.
Cu excepţia scopului limitat de a indica publicului că Opera este licenţiată conform LPCC (Licenţa Publică Creative Commons), Creative Commons nu autorizează utilizarea de către niciuna dintre părţi a mărcii „Creative Commons” sau a oricărei alte mărci sau însemne ale Creative Commons fără consimţământul prealabil exprimat în scris al Creative Commons.

Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, limitarea dreptului de a folosi marca Creative Commons nu face parte din prezenţa licenţă.

1. Definiciones
"Obra Derivada" es una obra basada en la Obra licenciada, o en ésta y otras obras preexistentes, tales como traducciones, adaptaciones, trabajos derivativos, arreglos musicales u otras alteraciones de una obra literaria o artística, fonogramas o actuaciones, incluyendo las adaptaciones cinematográficas o cualquier otra forma en la que la Obra pueda ser reformulada, transformada o adaptada incluyendo cualquier forma reconociblemente derivada del original, excepto aquellas obras que constituyan una Colección, las cuales no serán consideradas Obras Derivadas a los fines de esta Licencia. Para evitar cualquier duda, cuando se trate de una obra musical, interpretación o fonograma, la sincronización de la Obra en relación temporal con una imagen en movimiento (sincronización) será considerada como una Obra Derivada para los efectos de esta Licencia.

El crédito requerido por esta Sección 4 (c) puede ser implementado de cualquier forma razonable, prevista, sin embargo, que en el caso de una Obra Derivada o de una Colección, tal crédito debe aparecer, como mínimo, como parte de los créditos correspondientes a los demás autores que contribuyeron, y de una manera igual de destacada. Para evitar dudas, el Licenciatario sólo podrá utilizar el crédito requerido por esta Sección 4 (c) con el propósito de la atribución en la manera anteriormente descrita y, al ejercer los derechos otorgados bajo esta Licencia, el Licenciatario no podrá implícita o explícitamente afirmar o implicar ninguna conexión, patrocinio o respaldo por parte del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Partes Reconocidas, según corresponda, del uso de la Obra, sin el permiso independiente, expreso, previo y por escrito del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Partes Reconocidas.

Ninguna de las disposiciones de esta Licencia se considerará renunciable, ni se consentirá violación alguna de ellas, a menos que tal renuncia o consentimiento sea por escrito y firmado por las partes que serán afectadas por tal renuncia o consentimiento.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.
Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.
Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
Section 1 – Definitions.
Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.
License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 – License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
Attribution.
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
ShareAlike.
In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.
This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

License
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:
Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;
The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.

Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised.

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform.

Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

DAS URHEBERRECHTLICH GESCHÜTZTE WERK ODER DER SONSTIGE SCHUTZGEGENSTAND (WIE UNTEN BESCHRIEBEN) WIRD UNTER DEN BEDINGUNGEN DIESER CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" ODER "LIZENZVERTRAG") ZUR VERFÜGUNG GESTELLT. DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER EINSCHLÄGIGE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT.
DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINER DURCH DIESEN LIZENZVERTRAG ERTEILTEN BEFUGNIS ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH EINVERSTANDEN. DER LIZENZGEBER ERTEILT IHNEN DIE HIER BESCHRIEBENE NUTZUNGSBEWILLIGUNG UNTER DER VORAUSSETZUNG, DASS SIE SICH MIT DIESEN VERTRAGSBEDINGUNGEN EINVERSTANDEN ERKLÄREN.
1. Definitionen
Unter einer "Bearbeitung" wird eine Übersetzung oder andere Bearbeitung des Werkes verstanden, die eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung von Ihnen ist bzw eine Übersetzung oder andere Bearbeitung eines anderen urheberrechtlichen Schutzgegenstandes als einem Werk, wenn diese zu einem eigenen Schutzrecht führt. Eine freie Benutzung eines Werkes wird nicht als Bearbeitung angesehen.
Unter den "Lizenzelementen" werden die folgenden Lizenzcharakteristika verstanden, die vom Lizenzgeber ausgewählt und in der Bezeichnung der Lizenz genannt werden: "Namensnennung", "Nicht-kommerziell", "Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen".
Unter dem "Lizenzgeber" wird die natürliche oder juristische Person verstanden, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet.
Unter einem "Sammelwerk" wird eine Sammlung verstanden, die infolge der Zusammenstellung einzelner Beiträge zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung darstellt. Darunter fallen auch Sammlungen von Werken, Daten oder anderen unabhängigen Elementen, die systematisch oder methodisch angeordnet und einzeln mit elektronischen Mitteln oder auf andere Weise zugänglich sind, wenn sie infolge der Auswahl oder Anordnung des Stoffes eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung sind (Datenbankwerke). Ein Sammelwerk wird im Zusammenhang mit dieser Lizenz nicht als Bearbeitung (wie oben beschrieben) angesehen.
Mit "SIE" und "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die die in dieser Lizenz erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung (Befugnisse) ausübt und die zuvor die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz im Hinblick auf das Werk nicht verletzt hat, oder die die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung trotz einer vorherigen Verletzung auszuüben.
Unter dem "Schutzgegenstand" wird das Werk oder Sammelwerk oder das Schutzobjekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts verstanden, das Ihnen unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird.
Unter dem "Urheber" wird die natürliche Person verstanden, die das Werk geschaffen hat.
Unter einem "verwandten Schutzrecht" wird das Recht an einem anderen urheberrechtlichen Schutzgegenstand als einem Werk verstanden, zum Beispiel einem nachgelassenen Werk, einem Lichtbild, einer Datenbank, einem Schallträger, einer Rundfunksendung, einem Laufbild oder einer Darbietung eines ausübenden Künstlers.
Unter dem "Werk" wird eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung verstanden, die Ihnen unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird.
2. Schranken des Urheberrechts.  Diese Lizenz lässt sämtliche Rechte unberührt, die sich aus den Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte, aus dem Erschöpfungsgrundsatz oder anderen Beschränkungen der Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers durch die Anwendung findenden Gesetze ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung.  Unter den Bedingungen dieses Lizenzvertrages erteilt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber eine unentgeltliche, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts) unbeschränkte, nicht-ausschließliche Nutzungsbewilligung, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art und Weise zu nutzen:
den Schutzgegenstand in körperlicher Form zu verwerten, insbesondere zu vervielfältigen und zu verbreiten;
den Schutzgegenstand in unkörperlicher Form öffentlich wiederzugeben, insbesondere zu senden, weiterzusenden, vorzutragen, aufzuführen, vorzuführen und öffentlich zur Verfügung zu stellen;
den Schutzgegenstand auf Bild- oder Schallträger festzuhalten und mit dem Bild- oder Schallträger auf die in 3 a., b. oder d. erlaubte Weise zu verfahren;
den Schutzgegenstand zu übersetzen oder in anderer Weise zu bearbeiten und die Übersetzungen oder anderen Bearbeitungen zu veröffentlichen und in dem in 3 a. bis c. genannten Umfang zu verwerten.
Die in diesem Lizenzvertrag erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung kann für alle bekannten Nutzungsarten ausgeübt werden. Die genannte Nutzungsbewilligung beinhaltet die Befugnis, solche Veränderungen an dem Werk vorzunehmen, die technisch erforderlich sind, um die Nutzungsbewilligung für alle Nutzungsarten wahrzunehmen. Insbesondere sind davon die Anpassung an andere Medien und auf andere Dateiformate umfasst.
4. Beschränkungen.  Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Ziffer 3 erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder im Sinne von Ziffer 3.b. dieses Vertrags öffentlich wiedergeben und Sie müssen stets eine Kopie oder die vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) dieser Lizenz beifügen, wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder im Sinne von Ziffer 3.b. dieses Vertrags öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie dürfen keine Vertragsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Befugnisse ändern oder beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Sie müssen alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungs- und/oder Gewährleistungsausschluss hinweisen. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand mit keinen technischen Schutzmaßnahmen versehen, die den Zugang oder den Gebrauch des Schutzgegenstandes in einer Weise kontrollieren, die mit den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz im Widerspruch stehen. Die genannten Beschränkungen gelten auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet; sie verlangen aber nicht, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt zum Gegenstand dieser Lizenz gemacht wird. Wenn Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Aufforderung eines Lizenzgebers oder Urhebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk jeglichen Hinweis auf diesen Lizenzgeber oder diesen Urheber entfernen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand bearbeiten, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Aufforderung eines Rechtsinhabers hin von der Bearbeitung jeglichen Hinweis auf diesen Rechtsinhaber entfernen.
Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand oder eine Bearbeitung oder ein Sammelwerk vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder im Sinne von Ziffer 3.b. dieses Vertrags öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Urhebervermerke für den Schutzgegenstand unverändert lassen und die Urheberschaft oder Rechtsinhaberschaft in einer der von Ihnen vorgenommenen Nutzung angemessenen Form anerkennen, indem Sie den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Urhebers oder Rechtsinhabers nennen, wenn dieser angegeben ist. Dies gilt auch für den Titel des Schutzgegenstandes, wenn dieser angegeben ist, sowie - in einem vernünftigerweise durchführbaren Umfang - für die mit dem Schutzgegenstand zu verbindende vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI), wie sie der Lizenzgeber angegeben hat, sofern dies geschehen ist, es sei denn, diese Internetadresse verweist nicht auf den Urhebervermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zu dem Schutzgegenstand. Bei einer Bearbeitung ist ein Hinweis darauf aufzuführen, in welcher Form der Schutzgegenstand in die Bearbeitung eingegangen ist (z.B. "Französische Übersetzung des... (Werk) durch... (Urheber)" oder "Das Drehbuch beruht auf dem Werk des ... (Urheber)"). Ein solcher Hinweis kann in jeder angemessenen Weise erfolgen, wobei jedoch bei einer Bearbeitung, einer Datenbank oder einem Sammelwerk der Hinweis zumindest an gleicher Stelle und in ebenso auffälliger Weise zu erfolgen hat wie vergleichbare Hinweise auf andere Rechtsinhaber.
Obwohl die gemäß Ziffer 3 erteilten Befugnisse in umfassender Weise ausgeübt werden dürfen, findet diese Erlaubnis ihre gesetzliche Grenze in den Persönlichkeitsrechten sowie im Schutz der berechtigten geistigen Interessen der Urheber und ausübenden Künstler, die nicht dadurch gefährdet werden dürfen, dass ein Schutzgegenstand über das gesetzlich zulässige Maß hinaus beeinträchtigt wird.
5. Gewährleistung. Sofern dies von den Vertragsparteien nicht schriftlich anders vereinbart wurde, bietet der Lizenzgeber keine Gewährleistung für die in diesem Lizenzvertrag erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung. Für Mängel anderer Art, insbesondere bei der mangelhaften Lieferung von Verkörperungen des Schutzgegenstandes, richtet sich die Gewährleistung nach der Regelung, die die Person, die Ihnen den Schutzgegenstand zur Verfügung stellt, mit Ihnen außerhalb der Lizenz vereinbart, oder - wenn eine solche Regelung nicht getroffen wurde - nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften.
6. Haftung.  Über die in Ziffer 5 genannte Gewährleistung hinaus haftet Ihnen der Lizenzgeber bezüglich Schäden, die in Verbindung mit der Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung entstehen, nur für Vorsatz. Für Geschäfte zwischen Unternehmern und Verbrauchern im Sinne des österreichischen Konsumentenschutzgesetzes gilt die Abweichung, dass nur die Haftung für leichte Fahrlässigkeit bei anderen Schäden als Personenschäden ausgeschlossen ist.
7. Vertragsende
Dieser Lizenzvertrag und die durch diesen erteilten Befugnisse enden automatisch bei jeder Verletzung der Vertragsbedingungen durch Sie. Für natürliche und juristische Personen, die von Ihnen eine Bearbeitung, eine Datenbank oder ein Sammelwerk unter diesen Lizenzbedingungen erhalten haben, gilt die Lizenz jedoch weiter, vorausgesetzt, diese natürlichen oder juristischen Personen erfüllen sämtliche Vertragsbedingungen. Die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 und 8 gelten bei einer Vertragsbeendigung fort.
Unter den oben genannten Bedingungen erfolgt die Lizenz dauerhaft (für die Dauer des Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts). Dennoch behält sich der Lizenzgeber das Recht vor, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen zu nutzen oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit zu beenden, vorausgesetzt, dass solche Handlungen nicht dem Widerruf dieser Lizenz dienen (oder jeder anderen Lizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz erfolgt ist oder erfolgen muss) und diese Lizenz wirksam bleibt, bis sie unter den oben genannten Voraussetzungen endet.
8. Schlussbestimmungen
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder im Sinne von Ziffer 3.b. dieses Vertrags öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Erwerber eine Lizenz für den Schutzgegenstand unter denselben Vertragsbedingungen an, unter denen er Ihnen die Lizenz erteilt hat.
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder im Sinne von Ziffer 3.b. dieses Vertrags öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Erwerber eine Lizenz für den ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand unter denselben Vertragsbedingungen an, unter denen er Ihnen die Lizenz erteilt hat.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieses Lizenzvertrages unwirksam sein, so wird die Wirksamkeit der übrigen Lizenzbestimmungen dadurch nicht berührt und an die Stelle der unwirksamen Bestimmung tritt die wirksame Bestimmung, die dem mit der unwirksamen Bestimmung angestrebten Zweck am nächsten kommt.
Nichts soll dahingehend ausgelegt werden, dass auf eine Bestimmung dieses Lizenzvertrages verzichtet oder einer Vertragsverletzung zugestimmt wird, so lange ein solcher Verzicht oder eine solche Zustimmung nicht schriftlich vorliegt und von der verzichtenden oder zustimmenden Vertragspartei unterschrieben ist.
Dieser Lizenzvertrag stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen den Vertragsparteien hinsichtlich des Schutzgegenstandes dar. Es gibt keine weiteren ergänzenden Vereinbarungen oder mündlichen Abreden im Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand. Der Lizenzgeber ist an keine zusätzlichen Abreden gebunden, die aus irgendeiner Absprache mit Ihnen entstehen könnten. Der Lizenzvertrag kann nicht ohne eine übereinstimmende schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen abgeändert werden.
Auf diesen Lizenzvertrag findet das Recht der Bundesrepublik Österreich Anwendung.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE AND/OR APPLICABLE LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopaedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this Licence.
"Derivative Work" means a work that reproduces a substantial part of the Work, or of the Work and other pre-existing works protected by copyright, or that is an adaptation of a Work that is a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work. Derivative Works include a translation, musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this Licence.
"Moral rights law" means laws under which an individual who creates a work protected by copyright has rights of integrity of authorship of the work, rights of attribution of authorship of the work, rights not to have authorship of the work falsely attributed, or rights of a similar or analogous nature in the work anywhere in the world.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the work or other subject-matter protected by copyright that is offered under the terms of this Licence, which may include (without limitation) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, a sound recording, cinematograph film, a published edition of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or a television or sound broadcast.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
"Licence Elements" means the following high-level licence attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution, NonCommercial, NoDerivatives, ShareAlike.
2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights. Nothing in this Licence excludes or modifies, or is intended to exclude or modify, (including by reducing, limiting, or restricting) the rights of You or others to use the Work arising from fair dealings or other limitations on the rights of the copyright owner or the Original Author under copyright law, moral rights law or other applicable laws.
3. Licence Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to publish, communicate to the public, distribute copies or records of, exhibit or display publicly, perform publicly and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
to publish, communicate to the public, distribute copies or records of, exhibit or display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor under this Licence are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(c) and 4(d).
4. Restrictions. The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy or record of the Work You publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that exclude, alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of representations and warranties. You may not publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
If you publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work. You must also give the Original Author clear and reasonably prominent credit, and (if applicable) that credit must be given in the particular way made known by the Original Author and otherwise as reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing, by conveying the identity (such as by name or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licences. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the communication to the public, broadcast, public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency, designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency) or a music publisher, royalties for any record You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory licence created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or an equivalent statutory licence under the Australian Copyright Act or in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory licence created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
False attribution prohibited. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor, if You publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works in accordance with this Licence, You must not falsely attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author.
Prejudice to honour or reputation prohibited. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor, if you publish, communicate to the public, distribute, publicly exhibit or display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must not do anything that results in a material distortion of, the mutilation of, or a material alteration to, the Work that is prejudicial to the Original Author's honour or reputation, and You must not do anything else in relation to the Work that is prejudicial to the Original Author's honour or reputation.
5. Disclaimer.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENCE OR OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, AND TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK "AS-IS" AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK, OR OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
6. Limitation on Liability.
TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM CONTRARY MUTUAL AGREEMENT AS REFERRED TO IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) LOSS OF PRODUCTION OR OPERATION TIME, LOSS, DAMAGE OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR RECORDS; OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, OPPORTUNITY, REVENUE, PROFIT OR GOODWILL, OR OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS; OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENCE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
If applicable legislation implies warranties or conditions, or imposes obligations or liability on the Licensor in respect of this Licence that cannot be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified, the Licensor's liability is limited, to the full extent permitted by the applicable legislation, at its option, to:
in the case of goods, any one or more of the following:
the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
the repair of the goods;
the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;
the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
in the case of services:
the supplying of the services again; or
the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
7. Termination.
This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this Licence.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous.
Each time You publish, communicate to the public, distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You under this Licence.
Each time You publish, communicate to the public, distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You under this Licence.
If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, there are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by the laws in force in New South Wales, Australia.
Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, makes no representation or warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

Licence
L’OEUVRE (TELLE QUE DEFINIE CI-DESSOUS) EST MISE A DISPOSITION SELON LES TERMES DE CETTE CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (CI-APRES « CCPL » OU « LICENCE»). L’OEUVRE EST PROTEGEE PAR LE DROIT D’AUTEUR, ET/OU, SI PERTINENT, PAR LES DROITS VOISINS, OU LE DROIT SUI GENERIS SUR LES BASES DE DONNEES ET/OU TOUT AUTRE DROIT APPLICABLE. CONFORMEMENT AUX LOIS EN VIGUEUR. TOUTE UTILISATION DE L’OEUVRE QUI N’EST PAS EXPLICITEMENT AUTORISEE PAR CETTE LICENCE EST INTERDITE.
TOUTE UTILISATION DE L’OEUVRE D’UNE MANIERE COUVERTE PAR UN DROIT VISE PAR CETTE LICENCE VAUT ACCEPTATION DE CETTE LICENCE. PAR LA PRESENTE LICENCE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE VOUS OCTROIE LES DROITS DEFINIS CI-APRES SUITE A VOTRE ACCEPTATION DES TERMES ET CONDITIONS SUIVANTES.
1. Définitions
Par «Oeuvre Collective» on entend une œuvre dans laquelle l’Oeuvre, dans sa forme intégrale et non modifiée, est assemblée en un tout collectif avec une série d’autres contributions qui constituent en elles-mêmes des œuvres séparées et indépendantes. Constituent notamment des Oeuvres Collectives les œuvres de compilation, les publications périodiques, les anthologies ou les encyclopédies. Une Oeuvre qui constitue une Oeuvre Collective ne sera pas considérée comme une Oeuvre Dérivée (telle que définie ci-après) aux termes de cette Licence.
Par « Oeuvre Dérivée » on entend une oeuvre créée à partir de l’Oeuvre ou à partir de l’Oeuvre et d’autres oeuvres préexistantes, telle qu’une traduction, un arrangement musical, une adaptation théâtrale, littéraire ou cinématographique, un enregistrement sonore, une reproduction artistique, un résumé ou abrégé, ou toute autre forme sous laquelle l’Oeuvre peut être remaniée, modifiée, transformée ou adaptée, à l’exception des Oeuvres Collectives, qui ne seront pas considérées comme des Oeuvres Dérivées aux termes de la présente Licence. Afin d’éviter toute interprétation contraire, lorsque l’Oeuvre est une composition musicale ou un phonogramme, la synchronisation de cette Oeuvre à une image en mouvement (« synching ») sera considérée comme une Oeuvre Dérivée aux termes de la présente Licence.
Par « Donneur de Licence » on entend la personne physique ou morale qui accorde les droits sur l’Oeuvre selon les termes de la présente Licence.
Par « Auteur originaire » on entend la personne physique qui a créé l’Oeuvre ou, dans le cas d’un objet protégé par un droit voisin, le titulaire originaire du droit voisin.
Par « Oeuvre » on entend l’Oeuvre littéraire et artistique protégée par un droit d'auteur et faisant l’objet de la présente licence. Pour les besoins de la présente Licence, l’ « Oeuvre » inclut également les objets protégés par un droit voisin, tels qu’une interprétation, un phonogramme, une première fixation de film ou une émission de radiodiffusion, ainsi que les bases de données protégées par un droit sui generis, dans la mesure où ceux-ci forment l’objet de la présente licence. Si nécessaire, les dispositions de la présente Licence seront interprétés de manière à pouvoir être appliqués à de tels objets protégés.
Par « Vous » on entend la personne physique ou morale qui utilise l’Oeuvre d’une manière couverte par les droits visés par la présente Licence sans en avoir violé les termes au préalable ou qui a reçu la permission expresse du Donneur de Licence d’exercer ces droits en vertu de cette Licence malgré une violation préalable de cette dernière.
2. Exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs Rien dans cette Licence n’a pour effet de réduire, limiter ou restreindre l’application des exceptions aux droits exclusifs des titulaires des droits, à l’épuisement de ces droits ou à d’autres limitations à ces droits selon le droit d’auteur, les droits voisins, le droit sui generis des bases de données ou toute autre loi applicable.
3. Etendue de la Licence accordée Conformément aux termes et conditions définis dans cette Licence, le Donneur de Licence Vous octroie une licence mondiale, gratuite, non-exclusive et perpétuelle (pour toute la durée de protection de l’Oeuvre par le droit d’auteur, les droits voisins, le droit sui generis des bases de données), d’exercer les droits suivants sur l’Oeuvre:
reproduire l’Oeuvre de quelque manière et sous quelque forme que ce soit, incorporer l’Oeuvre dans une ou plusieurs Oeuvre(s) Collectives et reproduire l’Oeuvre telle qu’incorporée dans lesdites Oeuvres Collectives;
créer et reproduire des Oeuvres Dérivées;
louer, prêter et distribuer des exemplaires de l’Oeuvre, la communiquer au public, la mettre à disposition du public, en ce compris lorsque l’Oeuvre est incorporée dans des Oeuvres Collectives;
louer, prêter et distribuer des exemplaires d’Oeuvres Dérivées, les communiquer au public et les mettre à disposition du public;
lorsque l’Oeuvre est une base de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles de la base de données.
Cette Licence ne modifie en rien le régime de rémunérations équitables éventuellement mis en place en Belgique ou dans d’autres Etats en contrepartie de la reconnaissance légale de licences non volontaires, et n’a aucun effet sur la perception de ces rémunérations.
Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous les supports, médias, et formats, connus ou inconnus, à l’exception des formes d’exploitation encore inconnues.Vous avez également le droit d’apporter les modifications de l’Oeuvre techniquement nécessaires à l’exercice de ces droits sur d’autres supports, médias, et formats. L’Auteur Originaire renonce à exercer son droit moral relativement à ces modifications techniquement nécessaires. Tous les droits qui ne sont pas expressément concédés par le Donneur de Licence sont réservés.
4. Limitations La licence accordée à l’article 3 est expressément limitée de la manière suivante:
Vous pouvez prêter, distribuer, mettre à disposition du public, ou communiquer au public l’Oeuvre uniquement selon les termes de cette Licence, à la condition d’annexer une copie de la présente Licence ou l’Uniform Resource Identifier de cette Licence, à toute copie de l’Oeuvre que Vous prêtez, distribuez, mettez à disposition du public, ou communiquez au public. Vous ne pouvez pas offrir ou imposer des conditions d’utilisation de l’Oeuvre qui modifient ou restreignent les termes de la présente Licence ou l’exercice des droits concédés. Vous ne pouvez pas concéder de sous-licence sur l’Oeuvre. Vous devez conserver intactes toutes les indications qui renvoient à cette Licence et à la clause de garantie et d’exonération de responsabilité. Vous ne pouvez pas prêter, distribuer, mettre à disposition du public ou communiquer au public l’Oeuvre en utilisant une mesure technique de contrôle d’accès ou d’utilisation qui serait contraire aux termes de ce Contrat de Licence. Ce qui précède s’applique à l’Oeuvre telle qu’incorporée dans une Oeuvre Collective, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que l’Oeuvre Collective soit elle-même, indépendamment de l’Oeuvre, soumise aux termes de la présente Licence. Si vous créez une Oeuvre Collective, vous devez, à la demande de tout Donneur de Licence et dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l’Oeuvre Collective toute référence au dit Donneur de Licence ou à l’Auteur Originaire. Si vous créez une Oeuvre Dérivée, vous devez, à la demande de tout Donneur de Licence et dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l’Oeuvre Dérivée toute référence à ce Donneur de Licence ou à l’Auteur Originaire.
Si Vous prêtez, distribuez, mettez à disposition du public ou communiquez au public l’Oeuvre ou toute Oeuvre Dérivée ou toute Oeuvre Collective, Vous devez conserver intactes toutes les informations sur le régime des droits relatifs à l’Oeuvre et faire connaître la paternité de l’Oeuvre de l’Auteur Originaire de manière raisonnable eu égard au médium ou au moyen utilisé, notamment en communiquant le nom de l’Auteur Originaire (ou le pseudonyme le cas échéant) s’il est indiqué ; le titre de l’Oeuvre s’il est indiqué ; dans la mesure où cela est raisonnablement possible et s’il existe, l’Uniform Resource Identifier que le Donneur de Licence spécifie comme étant associé à l’Oeuvre, à moins que cet URI ne fasse aucune référence aux informations sur le régime des droits relatif à l’Oeuvre ou sur la licence applicables à l’Oeuvre; et dans le cas d’une Oeuvre Dérivée, en indiquant l’utilisation de l’Oeuvre dans l’Oeuvre Dérivée et en en identifiant les éléments (par exemple, en indiquant que l’Oeuvre Dérivée est une traduction française de l’Oeuvre par l’Auteur Originaire ou que l’Oeuvre Dérivée est un scénario basé sur l’Oeuvre Originale par l’Auteur Originaire). Ces indications doivent être mises en oeuvre de manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas d’une Oeuvre Dérivée ou d’une Oeuvre Collective, ces informations doivent être indiquées à tout le moins au même endroit et d’une manière aussi visible que le sont les autres mentions de paternité comparables.

Licentie
HET WERK (ZOALS HIERONDER OMSCHREVEN) WORDT TER BESCHIKKING GESTELD OVEREENKOMSTIG DE BEPALINGEN VAN DEZE CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (HIERNA “CCPL” OF “LICENTIE”). HET WERK WORDT BESCHERMD DOOR HET AUTEURSRECHT, EN/OF, INDIEN RELEVANT, DOOR DE NABURIGE RECHTEN, OF HET SUI GENERIS DATABANKENRECHT EN/OF ELK KRACHTENS DE GELDENDE WETGEVING VAN TOEPASSING ZIJNDE RECHT.

DOOR DEZE LICENTIE KENT DE LICENTIEGEVER U DE HIERNA OMSCHREVEN RECHTEN TOE INDIEN U DE VOLGENDE BEPALINGEN EN VOORWAARDEN AANVAARDT
1. Definities
Met “Collectief Werk” wordt een werk bedoeld waarin het Werk, in zijn geheel en in ongewijzigde vorm, samen met een aantal andere bijdragen, die elk een afzonderlijk en zelfstandig Werk vormen, tot een collectief geheel is samengevoegd. Collectieve Werken zijn onder andere geregeld een uitgave van een tijdschrift, bloemlezingen of encyclopedieën. Een Werk dat een Collectief Werk is, zal, krachtens deze Licentie, niet beschouwd worden als een Afgeleid Werk (zoals hieronder omschreven).
Met "Afgeleid Werk" wordt een werk bedoeld dat gebaseerd is op het Werk of op het Werk en andere reeds bestaande werken, zoals een vertaling, een muziekarrangement, een toneel-, literaire of cinematografische bewerking, een geluidsopname, een kunstreproductie, een ingekorte versie, een samenvatting of elke andere vorm waarin het Werk gewijzigd, omgezet of bewerkt kan worden, met uitzondering van de Collectieve Werken, die niet als Afgeleide Werken zullen beschouwd worden in de zin van deze Licentie. Om onduidelijkheid te vermijden zal, indien het Werk een muziekwerk of een fonogram is, de synchronisatie van het Werk met een bewegend beeld (“synching”) als een Afgeleid Werk in de zin van deze Licentie beschouwd worden.
Met "Licentiegever" wordt de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon bedoeld die de rechten op het Werk toekent volgens de bepalingen van deze Licentie.
Met "Oorspronkelijke Auteur” wordt de natuurlijke persoon bedoeld die het Werk gemaakt heeft of, indien het gaat om een voorwerp dat door een naburig recht beschermd wordt, de oorspronkelijke titularis van het naburig recht.
Met "Werk” wordt het Werk van letterkunde of kunst bedoeld dat beschermd wordt door het auteursrecht en dat het voorwerp is van deze licentie. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie omvat het “Werk” ook voorwerpen die beschermd worden door een naburig recht, zoals een uitvoering, een fonogram, een eerste vastlegging van film of radio-uitzending, alsook de databanken die beschermd worden door een sui generis-recht, voor zover deze het voorwerp vormen van deze licentie. Indien nodig, zullen de bepalingen van deze Licentie op zo een manier geïnterpreteerd worden dat ze op dergelijke beschermde voorwerpen toegepast kunnen worden.
Met "U" wordt de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon bedoeld die het Werk gebruikt op een wijze die geregeld wordt door de rechten waarop deze Licentie betrekking heeft en die de bepalingen van deze Licentie met betrekking tot het Werk niet eerder geschonden heeft of die de uitdrukkelijke toestemming van de Licentiegever gekregen heeft om rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen ondanks een eerdere schending van deze.
2. Uitzonderingen en beperkingen op de exclusieve rechten Niets in deze Licentie heeft de bedoeling de toepassing van de uitzonderingen op de exclusieve rechten van de rechthebbenden, de uitputting van deze rechten of andere beperkingen op deze rechten krachtens het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het sui generis databankenrecht of elk ander van toepasselijk recht te verminderen, te begrenzen of te beperken.
3. Omvang van de toegekende Licentie In overeenstemming met de bepalingen en voorwaarden van deze Licentie, verleent de Licentiegever U een licentie die wereldwijd, gratis, niet-exclusief en onbeperkt in tijd (voor de volledige duur van de bescherming van het Werk door het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het sui generis recht op de databanken) is om de volgende rechten met betrekking tot het Werk uit te oefenen:
het reproduceren, op welke wijze en in welke vorm dan ook, van het Werk, het opnemen van het Werk in één of meer Collectieve Werken en het reproduceren van het Werk zoals het opgenomen is in de genoemde Collectieve Werken;
het maken en reproduceren van Afgeleide Werken;
het verhuren, uitlenen en verspreiden van exemplaren van het Werk, het meedelen aan het publiek en het ter beschikking stellen van het publiek. Hetzelfde geldt voor het Werk wanneer het opgenomen is in een Collectief Werk;
het verhuren, uitlenen en verspreiden van exemplaren van Afgeleide Werken, ze meedelen aan het publiek en ze ter beschikking stellen van het publiek;
indien het Werk een databank is, het opvragen en hergebruiken van substantiële delen van de databank.
Deze Licentie wijzigt geenszinsnde regeling van de billijke vergoedingen, die eventueel van kracht is in België of in andere landen, ter compensatie van de wettelijke erkenning van gedwongen licenties en heeft geen invloed op de inning van deze vergoedingen.
De hierboven vermelde rechten mogen uitgeoefend worden op alle bekende en onbekende dragers, media en formaten, met uitzondering van onbekende exploitatievormen. U heeft eveneens het recht om die wijzigingen aan het Werk aan te brengen die technisch noodzakelijk zijn voor de uitoefening van de hoger genoemde rechten op andere dragers, media en formaten. Oorspronkelijke Auteur ziet af van de uitoefening van zijn/haar morele rechten met betrekking tot de wijzigingen die technisch noodzakelijk zijn. De Licentiegever behoudt zich alle rechten voor die niet uitdrukkelijk overgedragen zijn in deze Licentie.
4. Beperkingen De in artikel 3 toegekende licentie wordt uitdrukkelijk op de volgende manier beperkt:
U mag het Werk enkel in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Licentie, uitlenen, verspreiden, ter beschikking stellen van het publiek of meedelen aan het publiek op voorwaarde dat U een kopie van deze Licentie of de Uniform Resource Identifier van deze Licentie toevoegt aan elke kopie van het Werk dat U uitleent, verspreidt, ter beschikking stelt van het publiek of meedeelt aan het publiek. U mag geen voorwaarden op het gebruik van het Werk aanbieden of opleggen die de bepalingen van deze Licentie of de uitoefening van de toegekende rechten wijzigen of beperken. U mag het werk niet in onderlicentie geven. U moet alle aanduidingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie en naar de garantieclausule en de uitsluiting van aansprakelijkheid intact houden. U mag het Werk niet uitlenen, verspreiden, ter beschikking stellen van het publiek of meedelen aan het publiek indien daarbij een technische maatregel gebruikt wordt die de toegang tot of het gebruik van het Werk op een met de bepalingen van deze Licentie strijdige wijze controleert. Het voorgaande geldt voor het Werk dat opgenomen is in een Collectief Werk maar dat houdt niet in dat het Collectief Werk zelf, afgezien van het Werk, onderworpen wordt aan de bepalingen van deze Licentie. Indien U een Collectief Werk maakt, dan moet U, op aanvraag van om het even welke Licentiegever en in de mate van het mogelijke, elke verwijzing naar de Licentiegever of de Oorspronkelijke Auteur uit het Collectief Werk verwijderen. Indien U een Afgeleid Werk maakt, dan moet U, op aanvraag van om het even welke Licentiegever en in de mate van het mogelijke, elke verwijzing naar de Licentiegever of de Oorspronkelijke Auteur uit het Afgeleide Werk verwijderen.
Indien U het Werk, Afgeleide Werken of Collectieve Werken uitleent, verspreidt, ter beschikking stelt aan het publiek of meedeelt aan het publiek, dan moet U alle informatie betreffende het beheer van rechten met betrekking tot het Werk intact houden en, op een wijze die redelijk is in verhouding tot het gebruikte medium of middel, verwijzen naar de Oorspronkelijke Auteur, door het verstrekken van de naam van de Oorspronkelijke Auteur (of het pseudoniem indien van toepassing) indien deze wordt vermeld; de titel van het Werk indien deze wordt vermeld; in de mate dit redelijkerwijze mogelijk is en indien deze beschikbaar is, de Uniform Resource Identifier, dat de Licentiegever aanduidt als verbonden met het Werk, tenzij die URI niet verwijst naar de informatie betreffende het beheer van rechten met betrekking tot het Werk of naar de van toepassing zijnde licenties op het Werk; en in het geval van een Afgeleid Werk, door het aanduiden van het gebruik van het Werk in het Afgeleid Werk en door het identificeren van de elementen (bijvoorbeeld, door de aanduiding “Franse vertaling van het Oorspronkelijk Werk door de Auteur” “Franse vertaling van het Werk door de Oorspronkelijke Auteur” of “scenario gebaseerd op het Oorspronkelijk Werk door de Oorspronkelijke Auteur”). De verwijzing naar de Oorspronkelijke Auteur moet gebeuren op een redelijke manier. In het geval van een Afgeleid Werk of een Collectief Werk, moeten deze verwijzingen echter minstens weergegeven worden op dezelfde plaats en op dezelfde wijze als andere vergelijkbare auteursvermeldingen.
5. Garantieclausule en uitsluiting van aansprakelijkheid
TENZIJ ER TUSSEN DE PARTIJEN SCHRIFTELIJK ANDERS OVEREENGEKOMEN IS, BIEDT DE LICENTIEGEVER HET WERK AAN ZOALS HET IS EN DOET DE LICENTIEGEVER GEEN VERKLARINGEN OVER HET WERK OF VERPLICHT HIJ ZICH TOT GEEN ENKELE GARANTIE, ONGEACHT OF DEZE UITDRUKKELIJK OF STILZWIJGEND, KRACHTENS DE WET OF OP EEN ANDERE GRONDSLAG RUST, HIERIN BEGREPEN, MAAR NIET BEPERKT TOT DE GARANTIE TEGEN UITWINNING, DE COMMERCIALISEERBAARHEID VAN HET WERK, DE FUNCTIONELE CONFORMITEIT, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN INBREUK OP RECHTEN VAN DERDEN, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN VERBORGEN OF ANDERE GEBREKEN, DE NAUWKEURIGHEID VAN HET WERK OF DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN FOUTEN EN GEBREKEN MET BETREKKING TOT DE INFORMATIE, ONGEACHT OF DEZE AL DAN NIET OPSPOORBAAR ZIJN. INDIEN DE OP DEZE LICENTIE VAN TOEPASSELIJKE WETGEVING EEN DERGELIJKE UITSLUITING VAN VERANTWOORDELIJKHEID VERBIEDT OF REGLEMENTEERT, DAN IS DEZE UITSLUITING VAN AANSPRAKELIJKHEID EN GARANTIE SLECHTS IN DE MATE TOEGELATEN DOOR DE WET VAN TOEPASSING.
6. Beperking van aansprakelijkheid
VOOR ZOVER DE VAN TOEPASSELIJKE WETGEVING DIT TOELAAT, ZAL DE LICENTIEGEVER IN GEEN ENKEL GEVAL AANSPRAKELIJK GEACHT WORDEN VOOR WELKE RECHTSTREEKSE OF ONRECHTSTREEKSE, MATERIËLE OF MORELE SCHADE DAN OOK, DIE VOORTVLOEIT UIT DEZE LICENTIE OF UIT HET GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK, ONGEACHT OF DE LICENTIEGEVER INGELICHT WERD OVER DE MOGELIJKHEID VAN DERGELIJKE SCHADE. 
7. Beëindiging
Elke inbreuk op de bepalingen van deze Licentie waarvoor U verantwoordelijk bent, leidt tot de ontbinding van rechtswege van deze Licentie en het einde van de rechten die er uit voortvloeien. Niettemin behouden de licenties op Afgeleide Werken of Collectieve Werken, die door U krachtens deze Licentie verleend werden aan natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen, hun werking ten opzichte van deze natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen, voor zover deze personen de bepalingen van deze licenties niet schenden. De artikels 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 en 8, blijven van kracht ongeacht de beëindiging van deze Licentie.
Indien de hierboven vermelde bepalingen en voorwaarden in acht genomen worden, is deze licentie onbeperkt in tijd (voor de duur van de bescherming van het Werk door het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten en het sui generis databankenrecht). Desalniettemin behoudt de Licentiegever zich op elk ogenblik het recht voor om het Werk onder een andere licentie of onder andere voorwaarden te exploiteren of om elke verspreiding van het Werk stop te zetten, zonder dat het gebruik maken van deze mogelijkheid deze Licentie (of elke andere licentie die, krachtens de bepalingen van deze Licentie, verleend werd of verleend moest worden) ongedaan kan maken, en deze Licentie zal onverminderd van kracht blijven tenzij de beëindiging intreedt wegens de hoger aangegeven redenen. 
8. Diversen
Telkens U het Werk of een Collectief Werk uitleent, verspreidt, meedeelt of ter beschikking stelt van het publiek, verleent de Licentiegever aan de ontvanger een licentie die van toepassing is op het Werk en die dezelfde bepalingen en voorwaarden bevat als deze Licentie.
Telkens U het Afgeleid Werk uitleent, verspreidt, meedeelt of ter beschikking stelt van het publiek, verleent de Licentiegever aan de ontvanger een licentie die van toepassing is op het oorspronkelijke Werk en die dezelfde bepalingen en voorwaarden bevat als deze Licentie
Indien een bepaling uit deze Licentie, krachtens het van toepassing zijnde recht, nietig of niet afdwingbaar is, dan zal dit geen invloed hebben op de geldigheid en de afdwingbaarheid van de andere bepalingen. In dit geval zal, zonder dat enige tussenkomst van de partijen hiervoor nodig is, een dergelijke bepaling op een zodanige wijze geïnterpreteerd worden dat haar geldigheid en afdwingbaarheid gevrijwaard blijven.
Geen enkele afstand ten opzichte van de bepalingen en voorwaarden van deze Licentie wordt vermoed zonder een schriftelijke overeenkomst die ondertekend is door de partij die afstand doet. Geen enkele inbreuk op deze Licentie wordt door de andere partij aanvaard zonder schriftelijke overeenkomst, ondertekend door deze partij.
Deze Licentie is het enige contract tussen de partijen met betrekking tot het Werk, dat het voorwerp is van deze Licentie. Er bestaat geen enkele overeenkomst of document van welke aard dan ook, die betrekking heeft op het Werk, bovenop wat hier bepaald is. De Licentiegever is gebonden door geen enkele bijkomende verplichting die voortvloeit uit enige communicatie afkomstig van U, ongeacht de vorm. Deze Licentie kan niet gewijzigd worden zonder de schriftelijke overeenkomst van beide partijen.
Creative Commons is geen partij bij deze Licentie en verleent geen enkele garantie met betrekking tot het Werk. Creative Commons sluit alle verantwoordelijkheid met betrekking tot deze Licentie tegenover U en tegenover elke derde uit, ongeacht de juridische grondslag van deze verantwoordelijkheid en ongeacht de aard van de opgelopen schade, of deze rechtstreeks of onrechtstreeks, materieel of moreel is. Zonder dat afbreuk gedaan wordt aan de vorige alinea, zal Creative Commons, indien deze zich uitdrukkelijk bekendgemaakt heeft als Licentiegever in het kader van deze Licentie, alle rechten en plichten van Licentiegever bezitten. Met uitzondering van het gebruik dat bestemd is om het publiek te informeren dat het Werk onder CCPL valt, zal geen enkele partij het merk “Creative Commons” of enige andere aanduiding of logo dat toekomt aan Creative Commons gebruiken zonder de voorafgaande schriftelijke instemming van Creative Commons. Elk door Creative Commons toegelaten gebruik moet in overeenstemming zijn met de trademark usage guidelines die van kracht zijn op het ogenblik van het gebruik, zoals deze gepubliceerd worden op de website of beschikbaar worden gesteld op individueel verzoek.

1. Definições
"Obra Coletiva" significa uma obra, tal como uma edição periódica, antologia ou enciclopédia, na qual a Obra em sua totalidade e de forma inalterada, em conjunto com um número de outras contribuições, constituindo obras independentes e separadas em si mesmas, são agregadas em um trabalho coletivo. Uma obra que constitua uma Obra Coletiva não será considerada Obra Derivada (conforme definido abaixo) para os propósitos desta licença.
"Obra Derivada" significa uma obra baseada sobre a Obra ou sobre a Obra e outras obras pré-existentes, tal como uma tradução, arranjo musical, dramatização, romantização, versão de filme, gravação de som, reprodução de obra artística, resumo, condensação ou qualquer outra forma na qual a Obra possa ser refeita, transformada ou adaptada, com a exceção de que uma obra que constitua uma Obra Coletiva não será considerada Obra Derivada para fins desta licença. Para evitar dúvidas, quando a Obra for uma composição musical ou gravação de som, a sincronização da Obra em relação cronometrada com uma imagem em movimento (“synching”) será considerada uma Obra Derivada para os propósitos desta licença.
"Licenciante" significa a pessoa física ou a jurídica que oferece a Obra sob os termos desta licença.
"Autor Original" significa a pessoa física ou jurídica que criou a Obra.
"Obra" significa a obra autoral, passível de proteção pelo direito autoral, oferecida sob os termos desta licença.
"Você" significa a pessoa física ou jurídica exercendo direitos sob esta Licença que não tenha previamente violado os termos desta Licença com relação à Obra, ou que tenha recebido permissão expressa do Licenciante para exercer direitos sob esta Licença apesar de uma violação prévia.
2. Direitos de Uso Legítimo. Nada nesta licença deve ser interpretado de modo a reduzir, limitar ou restringir quaisquer direitos relativos ao uso legítimo, ou outras limitações sobre os direitos exclusivos do titular de direitos autorais sob a legislação autoral ou quaisquer outras leis aplicáveis.
3. Concessão da Licença. O Licenciante concede a Você uma licença de abrangência mundial, sem royalties, não-exclusiva, perpétua (pela duração do direito autoral aplicável), sujeita aos termos e condições desta Licença, para exercer os direitos sobre a Obra definidos abaixo:
reproduzir a Obra, incorporar a Obra em uma ou mais Obras Coletivas e reproduzir a Obra quando incorporada em Obra Coletiva;
criar e reproduzir Obras Derivadas;
distribuir cópias ou gravações da Obra, exibir publicamente, executar publicamente e executar publicamente por meio de uma transmissão digital de áudio a Obra, inclusive quando incorporada em Obras Coletivas;
distribuir cópias ou gravações de Obras Derivadas, exibir publicamente, executar publicamente e executar publicamente por meio de uma transmissão digital de áudio Obras Derivadas.
De modo a tornar claras estas disposições, quando uma Obra for uma composição musical:
i. Royalties e execução pública. O Licenciante renuncia o seu direito exclusivo de coletar, seja individualmente ou através de entidades coletoras de direitos de execução (por exemplo, ECAD, ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), o valor dos seus direitos autorais pela execução pública da obra ou execução pública digital (por exemplo, webcasting) da Obra se esta execução for predominantemente intencionada ou direcionada à obtenção de vantagem comercial ou compensação monetária privada.
ii. Royalties e Direitos fonomecânicos. O Licenciante renuncia o seu direito exclusivo de coletar, seja individualmente ou através de uma entidade designada como seu agente (por exemplo, a agência Harry Fox), royalties relativos a quaisquer gravações que Você criar da Obra (por exemplo, uma versão “cover”) e distribuir, conforme as disposições aplicáveis de direito autoral.
Direitos de Execução Digital pela Internet (Webcasting) e royalties. De modo a evitar dúvidas, quando a Obra for uma gravação de som, o Licenciante reserva o seu direito exclusivo de coletar, seja individualmente ou através de entidades coletoras de direitos de execução (por exemplo, SoundExchange ou ECAD), royalties e direitos autorais pela execução digital pública (por exemplo, Webcasting) da Obra, conforme as disposições aplicáveis de direito autoral, se a execução digital pública feita por Você for predominantemente intencionada ou direcionada à obtenção de vantagem comercial ou compensação monetária privada.
Os direitos acima podem ser exercidos em todas as mídias e formatos, independente de serem conhecidos agora ou concebidos posteriormente. Os direitos acima incluem o direito de fazer modificações que forem tecnicamente necessárias para exercer os direitos em outras mídias, meios e formatos. Todos os direitos não concedidos expressamente pelo Licenciante ficam aqui reservados.
4. Restrições.A licença concedida na Seção 3 acima está expressamente sujeita e limitada aos seguintes termos:
Você pode distribuir, exibir publicamente, executar publicamente ou executar publicamente por meios digitais a Obra apenas sob os termos desta Licença, e Você deve incluir uma cópia desta licença, ou o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (Uniform Resource Identifier) para esta Licença, com cada cópia ou gravação da Obra que Você distribuir, exibir publicamente, executar publicamente, ou executar publicamente por meios digitais. Você não poderá oferecer ou impor quaisquer termos sobre a Obra que alterem ou restrinjam os termos desta Licença ou o exercício dos direitos aqui concedidos aos destinatários. Você não poderá sub-licenciar a Obra. Você deverá manter intactas todas as informações que se referem a esta Licença e à exclusão de garantias. Você não pode distribuir, exibir publicamente, executar publicamente ou executar publicamente por meios digitais a Obra com qualquer medida tecnológica que controle o acesso ou o uso da Obra de maneira inconsistente com os termos deste Acordo de Licença. O disposto acima se aplica à Obra enquanto incorporada em uma Obra Coletiva, mas isto não requer que a Obra Coletiva, à parte da Obra em si, esteja sujeita aos termos desta Licença. Se Você criar uma Obra Coletiva, em havendo notificação de qualquer Licenciante, Você deve, na medida do razoável, remover da Obra Coletiva qualquer referência a este Licenciante ou Autor Original, conforme solicitado. Se você criar uma Obra Derivada, em havendo notificação de qualquer Licenciante, Você deve, na medida do razoável, remover da Obra Derivada qualquer referência a este Licenciante ou ao Autor Original, conforme solicitado.
Se Você distribuir, exibir publicamente, executar publicamente ou executar publicamente por meios digitais a Obra ou qualquer Obra Derivada ou Obra Coletiva, Você deve manter intactas todas as informações relativas a direitos autorais sobre a Obra e atribuir ao Autor Original crédito razoável com relação ao meio ou mídia que Você está utilizando, através da veiculação do nome (ou pseudônimo, se for o caso) do Autor Original, se fornecido; o título da Obra, se fornecido; na medida do razoável, o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante especificar para estar associado à Obra, se houver, exceto se o URI não se referir ao aviso de direitos autorais ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento da Obra; e no caso de Obra Derivada, crédito identificando o uso da Obra na Obra Derivada (exemplo: "Tradução Francesa da Obra de Autor Original", ou "Roteiro baseado na Obra original de Autor Original").

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE A SOLICITOR-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP.

Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a dictionary, yearbook, encyclopedia, or a newspaper, review magazine or singular periodical and any work written in distinct parts by different authors, or in which works or parts of works of different authors are incorporated. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this licence.
"Derivative Work" means a work that produces or reproduces the Work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatever. Derivative works include:
Translations of the Work;
Where the Work is a dramatic work, conversions of the Work into a novel or other non-dramatic work;
Where the Work is a novel or other non-dramatic work or an artistic work, conversions of the Work into a dramatic work by way of performance in public or otherwise;
Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical work, sound recordings, cinematograph films or other mechanical reproductions or performances of the Work; and
Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical or artistic work, reproductions, adaptations or public presentations of the Work as a cinematographic work.
A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. Where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in time-relation with a moving image (i.e. cinematographic work "synching") will be treated in the same way as a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Digital Audio Transmission" means an audio transmission in whole, or in part, in a digital or other nonanalog format.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this Licence.
"Original Author" means the individual who created the Work.
"Work" means the distinctive and original work of authorship offered under the terms of this Licence.
“Musical Work" means any work of music or musical composition, with or without words, and includes any compilation thereof;
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
"Moral Rights" means rights that an individual who creates a Work protected by copyright has concerning the integrity of the work, the attribution (or anonymity) of authorship, and the right not to be associated with a product, service, cause or institution, or rights of similar nature in the Work anywhere in the world.
"Licence Elements" means the following high-level Licence attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution, Noncommercial, NoDerivatives, ShareAlike.
"To use the work" means to reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof or, if the work is unpublished, to publish the work or any substantial part thereof and includes the right:
in the case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to communicate the work to the public by telecommunication;  
to present at a public exhibition, for a purpose other than sale or hire, an artistic work created after June 7, 1988, other than a map, chart or plan;
in the case of a computer program that can be reproduced in the ordinary course of its use, other than by a reproduction during its execution in conjunction with a machine, device or computer, to rent out the computer program; and
in the case of a musical work, to rent out a sound recording in which the work is embodied.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights accruing to fair dealing, and those exemptions afforded to educational institutions, libraries, archives, museums, computer programs, incidental inclusions and ephemeral recordings, or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. Licence Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) Licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to use the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to use the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or soundrecordings of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(e).
4. Restrictions. The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy or soundrecordings of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicence the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, include or remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, include or remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
Except as otherwise agreed by the Original Author, if You produce, reproduce, distribute, perform, publish, translate, convert, adopt or communicate to the public a Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works in any material form whatever, You must not do anything that would offend the Moral Right of Attribution of the Original Author, including but not limited to:
You must not falsely attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author; and
If applicable, You must respect the Original Author’s wish to remain anonymous or pseudonymous.
Except as otherwise agreed by the Original Author, the Moral Right of Integrity associated with the Work being licensed is expressly waived. This means the Original Author is not reserving the ability to prevent downstream creators from engaging in material distortion or modification of the work that may be prejudicial to the Original Author’s honour or reputation, including associating the Work with a particular product, service, cause or institution.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licences. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. SOCAN, ASCAP, BMI), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency, collective society, or designated agent, royalties for any soundrecording You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory licence created by section 69 (2) of the Canadian Copyright Act), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer. UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENCE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination.
This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this Licence.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You under this Licence.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You under this Licence.
If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent,
This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
You must abide the Licence during its term despite the expiry, initial invalidity or later invalidation of any intellectual property rights.
The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by the laws in force in Canada and, where applicable, those of the province in which the Licensor normally resides.
Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

Les reproductions, les adaptations et les présentations en public d’une œuvre de nature littéraire, dramatique, musicale ou artistique en tant qu’œuvre cinématographique.
Une œuvre qui constitue une œuvre collective ne sera pas considérée comme une œuvre dérivée pour les fins de la présente licence. Lorsque l’œuvre est une composition musicale ou un enregistrement sonore, la synchronisation de l’œuvre avec l’image en mouvement (c.-à-d. la synchronisation d’une œuvre cinématographique) sera traitée de la même façon qu’une œuvre dérivée pour les fins de la présente licence.

« Droits moraux » s’entend des droits que possède l’individu qui crée une œuvre protégée par le droit d’auteur relativement à l’intégrité de l’œuvre, à l’attribution de la paternité de l’œuvre (ou de l’anonymat) et au droit de ne pas être associé avec un produit, un service, une cause ou une institution ou des droits de nature similaire sur l’œuvre partout dans le monde.

De louer un enregistrement sonore qui inclut l’œuvre en question, dans le cas d’une œuvre musicale.
2. Droits d’utilisation équitable. La présente licence ne cherche aucunement à réduire, limiter ou restreindre les droits relatifs à l’utilisation équitable, ni les exceptions prévues relativement aux établissements d’enseignement, aux bibliothèques, aux services d’archives, aux musées, aux programmes informatiques, aux incorporations incidentes et aux enregistrements éphémères ni autrement à limiter les droits exclusifs du titulaire du droit d’auteur en vertu de la loi sur le droit d’auteur et des autres lois applicables.
3. Attribution de licence. Sous réserve des conditions de la présente licence, le concédant vous attribue une autorisation mondiale, libre de redevances, non exclusive et perpétuelle (pour la durée de la protection de l’œuvre par le droit d’auteur) vous permettant d’exercer des droits suivants sur l’œuvre.
D’utiliser l’œuvre, de l’incorporer dans une ou plusieurs œuvres collectives et d’utiliser l’œuvre telle qu’elle apparaît dans ces œuvres collectives;
De créer et de reproduire des œuvres dérivées;
De distribuer des exemplaires ou des enregistrements sonores de l’œuvre, de présenter, de représenter ou de communiquer l’œuvre, y compris l’œuvre incorporée dans une œuvre collective, au public par un procédé de transmission audionumérique
Les droits précités sont valables pour toute forme de support et de moyen de communication, actuelle ou à venir. Ces droits incluent le droit d’apporter toute modification technique nécessaire pour l’exercice de ces droits sur d’autres supports ou par d’autres moyens de communication. Les droits que le concédant n’accorde pas expressément sont par la présente réservés, y compris, notamment, les droits énoncés au paragraphe 4 e).
4. Restrictions. L’attribution de la licence prévue à l’article 3 est faite expressément sous réserve des exceptions suivantes :
Vous pouvez distribuer, présenter, représenter ou communiquer de façon numérique l’œuvre au public uniquement aux conditions stipulées dans la présente licence. Vous devez joindre une copie de la présente licence ou de l’identificateur de ressources uniformes à chaque copie ou enregistrement sonore de l’œuvre que vous distribuez, présentez, représentez ou communiquez de façon numérique au public. Vous ne pouvez pas offrir ou imposer de conditions sur l’œuvre qui altèrent ou restreignent les dispositions de la présente licence ou l’exercice des droits qu’elle accorde. Vous ne pouvez pas céder de sous-licence sur l’œuvre. Vous devez garder intacts tous les avis qui renvoient à cette licence et à l’exonération de responsabilité. Vous ne pouvez pas distribuer, présenter, représenter ou communiquer de façon numérique l’œuvre au public en utilisant un procédé technique qui contrôle l’accès ou l’utilisation de l’œuvre d’une manière contraire aux dispositions de la présente licence. Les remarques précédentes s’appliquent à l’œuvre incorporée dans une œuvre collective, mais non à l’œuvre collective dans son ensemble. Si vous créez une œuvre collective, à la demande du concédant, vous devez, dans la mesure du possible, inclure ou retirer de l’œuvre collective toute référence au concédant ou à l’auteur original. Si vous créez une œuvre dérivée, à la demande du concédant, vous devez, dans la mesure du possible, inclure ou retirer de l’œuvre dérivée toute référence au concédant ou à l’auteur original.
Si vous distribuez, présentez, représentez ou communiquez de façon numérique l’œuvre ou toute œuvre dérivée ou collective au public, vous devez garder intacts tous les avis de droit d’auteur concernant l’œuvre et reconnaître l’auteur original de façon raisonnable, eu égard au support ou moyen de communication utilisé, en indiquant, selon les renseignements disponibles, son nom (ou son pseudonyme, le cas échéant) le titre de l’œuvre, l’identificateur de ressources uniformes (URI) que le concédant associe à son œuvre, à moins que ce URI ne fasse pas référence à l’avis de droit d’auteur ou aux renseignements de la licence protégeant l’œuvre. Dans le cas d’une œuvre dérivée, il faut reconnaître l’utilisation de l’œuvre dans une œuvre dérivée (par ex., « traduction française de l’œuvre originale de l’auteur original » ou « mise en scène inspirée de l’œuvre originale de l’auteur original »). Cette reconnaissance peut se faire de n’importe quelle façon raisonnable. Toutefois, dans le cas d’une œuvre dérivée ou d’une œuvre collective, cette reconnaissance doit apparaître au même endroit et de façon aussi évidente que la reconnaissance des autres auteurs de cette nature.
Sous réserve d’une entente contraire avec l’auteur original, si vous présentez, reproduisez, distribuez, représentez, publiez, traduisez, transformez, adaptez ou communiquez l’œuvre ou toute œuvre dérivée ou collective au public d’une façon matérielle quelconque, vous ne devez rien faire qui puisse porter atteinte au droit moral de l’attribution par l’auteur original, notamment :
Vous ne devez pas attribuer faussement la paternité de l’œuvre à quelqu’un d’autre que l’auteur original; et
Le cas échéant, vous devez respecter le vœu de l’auteur original de rester anonyme ou d’être identifié par un pseudonyme.
Sous réserve d’une entente contraire avec l’auteur original, la présente licence comporte une renonciation expresse au droit moral d’intégrité associé avec l’œuvre protégée par la présente licence. Cela signifie que l’auteur original ne se réserve pas le droit d’empêcher les créateurs en aval d’apporter à l’œuvre des transformations ou de modifications matérielles qui pourraient porter atteinte à l’honneur ou à la réputation de l’auteur original, y compris l’association de l’œuvre avec un produit, un service, une cause ou une institution particulière.
Pour plus de certitude, lorsque l’œuvre est une composition musicale :
Redevances d’exécution sous licences générales. Le concédant se réserve le droit exclusif de percevoir, soit individuellement soit par l’intermédiaire d’une société de représentation (par ex. SOCAN, ASCAP, BMI), des redevances pour l’exécution en public ou sur support numérique (par ex. la diffusion Web) de l’œuvre si l’exécution est faite principalement afin de tirer un avantage commercial ou une compensation financière personnelle.
Droits mécaniques ou redevances réglementaires. Le concédant se réserve le droit exclusif de percevoir, soit individuellement soit par l’intermédiaire d’un organisme de gestion des droits musicaux, d’une société collective ou d’un organisme désigné, des redevances sur tout enregistrement sonore que vous créez à partir de l’œuvre (version imprimée) et que vous distribuez, sous réserve de la licence obligatoire prévue au paragraphe 69(2) de la Loi sur le droit d’auteur canadienne, si votre distribution de la version imprimée est faite principalement afin de tirer un avantage commercial ou une compensation financière personnelle.
5. Représentations, garanties et exonération de responsabilité. À MOINS D’UNE ENTENTE MUTUELLE CONTRAIRE ENTRE LES PARTIES, CONSIGNÉE PAR ÉCRIT, LE CONCÉDANT OFFRE L’ŒUVRE TELLE QU’ELLE. IL NE FAIT AUCUNE REPRÉSENTATION OU NE DONNE AUCUNE GARANTIE QUELCONQUE, EXPRESSE, TACITE, RÉGLEMENTAIRE OU AUTRE, CONCERNANT L’ŒUVRE, NOTAMMENT, RELATIVEMENT AU TITRE, À LA QUALITÉ MARCHANDE OU À LA PERTINENCE DE L’ŒUVRE POUR UNE FIN PARTICULIÈRE, À L’ABSENCE DE CONTREFAÇON OU DE DÉFAUTS LATENTS OU AUTRES, À L’EXACTITUDE OU À LA PRÉSENCE OU L’ABSENCE D’ERREURS, DÉCOUVRABLES OU PAS. DANS CERTAINS RESSORTS LES EXCLUSIONS RELATIVES AUX GARANTIES TACITES SONT INTERDITES; PAR CONSÉQUENT CETTE EXCLUSION POURRAIT NE PAS S’APPLIQUER À VOUS.
6. Limitation de responsabilité. SOUS RÉSERVE DES OBLIGATIONS PRÉVUES PAR LA LOI APPLICABLE ET SOUS RÉSERVE DES DOMMAGES RÉSULTANT DE LA RESPONSABILITÉ ENVERS UNE TIERCE PARTIE POUR CAUSE DE VIOLATION D’UNE DES GARANTIES PRÉVUES À L’ARTICLE 5, EN AUCUN CAS LE CONCÉDANT NE SERA TENU RESPONSABLE ENVERS VOUS, QUELLE QUE SOIT LA DOCTRINE DE DROIT INVOQUÉE, DE DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS PARTICULIERS, DIRECTS, INDIRECTS, PUNITIFS OU EXEMPLAIRES POUR LE PRÉJUDICE RÉSULTANT DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE OU DE L’UTILISATION DE L’ŒUVRE, MÊME SI LE CONCÉDANT A ÉTÉ AVISÉ DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE CE GENRE DE PRÉJUDICES.
7. Résiliation.
Tout manquement par vous aux conditions de la présente licence entraînera automatiquement la résiliation de cette licence et des droits qu’elle concède. La licence relative aux œuvres dérivées ou œuvres collectives que des individus ou des personnes morales ont reçue de vous en vertu de la présente licence, par contre, ne sera pas résiliée si ces individus ou ces personnes morales en respectent pleinement les modalités. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 demeurent en vigueur après la résiliation de la présente licence.
Sous réserve des conditions précitées, la présente licence est perpétuelle (pour la durée de la protection de l’œuvre par le droit d’auteur). Sans égard à ce qui précède, le concédant se réserve le droit de céder sous licence l’œuvre sous d’autres conditions ou de cesser la diffusion de l’œuvre à n’importe quel moment, mais uniquement si l’exercice de ce choix n’entraîne pas le retrait de la présente licence (ou tout autre licence qui a été accordée ou a dû être accordée aux termes de la présente licence). La présente licence demeurera alors pleinement en vigueur, à moins qu’elle ne soit résiliée de la façon précitée.
8. Divers.

Si une disposition de la présente licence est invalide ou inexécutable au regard de la loi applicable, les autres dispositions de la présente licence demeurent valides et en vigueur. Sans une action ultérieure des parties au contrat, toute disposition invalide sera interprétée en la réformant dans la mesure nécessaire afin de la rendre valide et exécutable.
Aucune renonciation aux conditions ou aux dispositions de la présente licence et aucune violation des conditions ou des dispositions de la présente licence ne seront réputées acceptées sans une entente écrite, signée par la personne compétente pour autoriser la renonciation ou accepter la violation.
Cette licence reflète la totalité de l’entente conclue entre les parties relativement à l’œuvre qui fait l’objet de la présente licence. Il n’existe aucune autre entente, accords ou représentations autres que celles précisées dans la présente licence. Le concédant ne sera lié par aucune disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une de vos communications.

Atribución 2.0 (Chile)
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION NO ES UN ESTUDIO DE ABOGADOS, NI OFRECE SERVICIOS LEGALES. LA DISTRIBUCIÓN DE ESTA LICENCIA NO GENERA UNA RELACIÓN ABOGADO-CLIENTE. CREATIVE COMMONS PROPORCIONA ESTA INFORMACIÓN TAL CUAL. CREATIVE COMMONS NO OFRECE GARANTÍAS SOBRE LA INFORMACIÓN SUMINISTRADA, NI ASUME RESPONSABILIDAD ALGUNA POR LOS DAÑOS QUE PUEDAN DERIVAR DE SU USO.
Licencia
LA OBRA (TAL Y COMO SE DEFINE MÁS ADELANTE) SE OTORGA BAJO ESTA LICENCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS (“LPCC” O “LICENCIA”). LA OBRA ESTÁ PROTEGIDA POR DERECHOS DE AUTOR Y/U OTRAS LEYES APLICABLES. QUEDA PROHIBIDO CUALQUIER USO QUE SE HAGA DE LA OBRA QUE NO CUENTE CON LA AUTORIZACIÓN PERTINENTE DE CONFORMIDAD CON LOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTA LICENCIA Y DE LA LEY DE PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL.
MEDIANTE EL EJERCICIO DE CUALQUIERA DE LOS DERECHOS QUE SE OTORGAN EN ESTA LICENCIA, USTED ACEPTA Y CONSIENTE VERSE OBLIGADO EN LOS TERMINOS QUE SE SEÑALAN EN ELLA. EL LICENCIANTE CONCEDE A USTED LOS DERECHOS CONTENIDOS EN ESTA LICENCIA CONDICIONADOS A LA ACEPTACIÓN DE SUS TERMINOS Y CONDICIONES.
1. Definiciones
“Obra Individual” es aquella producida por una sola persona.
"Obra Colectiva" es aquella producida por un grupo de autores, en que la Obra se encuentra sin modificaciones, junto con una cierta cantidad de otras contribuciones, que constituyen en sí mismos trabajos separados e independientes, que son integrados al todo colectivo, tales como publicaciones periódicas, antologías o enciclopedias.
"Obra en Colaboración" es aquella producida, conjuntamente, por dos o más personas naturales cuyos aportes no puedan ser separados.
"Obra Originaria" aquella que es primogénitamente creada.
“Obra Derivada” es aquella obra basada en una Obra originaria o en ésta y otras obras preexistentes, en que la Obra originaria es refundida, transformada, o adaptada, como por ejemplo una traducción, arreglo musical, dramatización, novelización, versión cinematográfica, registro sonoro, reproducción artística, compendio, resumen, o cualquier otra. Para evitar dudas, en el caso de que la Obra sea una composición musical o una grabación sonora, a efectos de esta Licencia la sincronización temporal de la Obra con una imagen en movimiento se considerará una Obra Derivada.
"Licenciante” es el individuo o la entidad que ofrece la Obra en conformidad con las condiciones de esta Licencia.
“Autor” es el individuo o entidad que creó la Obra.
“Obra” es aquella creación derivada de la inteligencia en los dominios literarios, artísticos y científicos, cualquiera sea su forma de expresión, susceptible de protección vía derecho de autor, ofrecida bajo las condiciones de esta Licencia.
“Usted” es el individuo o la entidad que ejercita los derechos otorgados al amparo de esta Licencia y que con anterioridad no ha violado las condiciones de la misma respecto a la Obra, o que haya obtenido autorización expresa por parte del Licenciante para ejercer los derechos al amparo de esta Licencia pese a una violación anterior.
2. Usos legítimos. Nada en esta Licencia podrá ser interpretado como una disminución, limitación o restricción de los derechos derivados del uso legítimo, del agotamiento u otras limitaciones o excepciones a los derechos del titular de los derechos de autor que le reconozcan las leyes.
3. Otorgamiento de la Licencia. Bajo los términos y condiciones de esta Licencia, el Licenciante otorga a Usted una licencia mundial, gratuita, no exclusiva y permanente (durante todo el período de vigencia de los derechos de autor) para ejercer estos derechos sobre la Obra tal y como se indica a continuación:
Reproducir la Obra, incorporar la Obra en una o más Obras Colectivas, y reproducir la Obra incorporada en las Obras Colectivas;
Crear y reproducir Obras Derivadas;
Distribuir copias de las Obras, exhibirlas públicamente, ejecutarlas públicamente y/o ponerlas a disposición pública, incluyéndolas como incorporadas en Obras Colectivas, según corresponda;
Distribuir copias de las Obras Derivadas que se generen, exhibirlas públicamente, ejecutarlas públicamente y/o ponerlas a disposición pública.
Cuando la Obra es una composición o interpretación musical el Licenciante se reserva el derecho exclusivo de percibir, ya sea individualmente o a través de una sociedad de gestión de derechos (p. ej. SCD u otras), los derechos por ejecución pública o puesta a disposición pública de la Obra (p. ej webcast), si dicha ejecución está básicamente intencionada o dirigida a obtener un provecho comercial o una compensación monetaria privada.
Los derechos mencionados anteriormente pueden ser ejercidos en todos los medios y formatos, actualmente conocidos o que se inventen en el futuro. Los derechos antes mencionados incluyen el derecho a realizar dichas modificaciones en la medida que sean técnicamente necesarias para ejercer los derechos en otro medio o formatos. Todos los derechos no otorgados expresamente por el Licenciante quedan por este medio reservados.
4. Restricciones. La licencia otorgada en la anterior Sección 3 está expresamente sujeta y limitada por las siguientes restricciones:
Usted puede distribuir, exhibir públicamente, ejecutar públicamente, o poner a disposición pública la Obra sólo bajo las condiciones de esta Licencia, y Usted debe incluir una copia de ésta o del Identificador Universal de Recursos con cada copia de la Obra que distribuya, exhiba públicamente, ejecute públicamente o ponga a disposición pública. No es posible ofrecer o imponer ninguna condición sobre la Obra que altere o limite las condiciones de esta Licencia o el ejercicio de los derechos de los destinatarios otorgados en este documento. No es posible sublicenciar la Obra. Usted debe mantener intactos todos los avisos que hagan referencia a esta Licencia y a la cláusula de garantías contemplada en el numeral 5. Usted no puede distribuir, exhibir públicamente, ejecutar públicamente, o poner a disposición pública la Obra con alguna medida tecnológica que controle el acceso o la utilización de ella de una forma que sea inconsistente con las condiciones de esta Licencia. Lo anterior se aplica a la Obra incorporada a una Obra Colectiva, pero esto no exige que la Obra Colectiva aparte de la obra misma quede sujeta a las condiciones de esta Licencia. Si Usted crea una Obra Colectiva, previo aviso a cualquier Licenciante debe, en la medida de lo posible, eliminar de la Obra Colectiva cualquier referencia a dicho Licenciante o al Autor Original, según lo solicitado. Si Usted crea una Obra Derivada, previo aviso de cualquier Licenciante, en la medida de lo posible, deberá remover de la Obra Derivada cualquier referencia a dicho Licenciante o al Autor Original, según lo solicitado.
Si Usted distribuye, exhibe y/o ejecuta públicamente, o pone a disposición pública la Obra o cualquier Obra Derivada o Colectiva, debe mantener intactos todos los avisos relativos a derechos de autor para la Obra y dar al Autor Original razonable crédito por los medios o métodos que Usted esté utilizando para expresar el nombre (o pseudónimo, si es del caso) del Autor Original si se facilita; el título de la Obra si se facilita; en la medida de lo posible, el Identificador Uniforme de Recursos (URI), si existe, que el Licenciante especifica para ser vinculado con la Obra, a menos que dicho URI no se refiera al aviso de derechos del autor o a la información de licenciamiento de la Obra; y en el caso de una Obra Derivada, un crédito que identifique el uso de la Obra en la Obra Derivada (p.ej. “Traducción al francés de la Obra del Autor Original” o “Guión basado en la Obra originaria de Autor Original”). Dicho crédito puede ser implementado de cualquier forma razonable; sin embargo, en el caso de una Obra Colectiva o Derivada, como mínimo dicho crédito aparecerá donde se incluya cualquier otro crédito de un autor comparable y de una forma que sea al menos tan destacable como el otro crédito de autor.
5. Garantía.
A MENOS QUE LAS PARTES LO CONVINIERAN DE OTRA FORMA POR ESCRITO, EL LICENCIANTE OFRECE LA OBRA “TAL CUAL”, SIN BRINDAR GARANTÍAS DE CLASE ALGUNA RESPECTO DE LA OBRA, YA SEA EXPRESA, IMPLÍCITA, LEGAL O CUALQUIERA OTRA, INCLUYENDO, SIN LIMITACIÓN, GARANTÍAS DE TITULARIDAD, COMERCIABILIDAD, ADAPTABILIDAD A PROPÓSITO DETERMINADO, AUSENCIA DE INFRACCIÓN, DE DEFECTOS LATENTES O DE OTRO TIPO, PRECISION O ERRORES, SEAN O NO DESCUBRIBLES. ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE GARANTÍAS IMPLÍCITAS, EN CUYO CASO ESTA EXCLUSIÓN PUEDE NO APLICARSE A USTED.
6. Limitación de responsabilidad.
A MENOS QUE LO EXIJA EXPRESAMENTE LA LEY APLICABLE, EL LICENCIANTE NO SERÁ RESPONSABLE ANTE USTED POR DAÑO ALGUNO, SEA POR RESPONSABILIDAD EXTRACONTRACTUAL O CONTRACTUAL, OBJETIVAS O SUBJETIVAS, SE TRATE DE DAÑOS MORALES O PATRINMONIALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PREVISTOS O IMPREVISTOS PRODUCIDOS POR EL USO DE ESTA LICENCIA O DE LA OBRA, AUN CUANDO EL LICENCIANTE HAYA SIDO ADVERTIDO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE DICHOS DAÑOS. ALGUNAS LEYES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE CIERTA RESPONSABILIDAD, EN CUYO CASO ESTA EXCLUSIÓN PUEDE NO APLICARSE A USTED.
7. Término.
Esta Licencia y los derechos otorgados en virtud de ella terminarán automáticamente si Usted infringe alguna condición establecida en ella. Sin embargo, los individuos o entidades que han recibido Obras Derivadas o Colectivas de Usted de conformidad con esta Licencia, no verán terminadas sus licencias, siempre que estos individuos o entidades sigan cumpliendo íntegramente las condiciones de estas licencias. Las Secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, y 8 subsistirán a cualquier terminación de esta Licencia.
Sujeta a las condiciones y términos anteriores, la licencia otorgada aquí es permanente (durante el período de vigencia de los derechos de autor de la obra). No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho a publicar y/o estrenar la Obra bajo condiciones de licencia diferentes o a dejar de distribuirla, en los términos de esta Licencia en cualquier momento; sin embargo, cualquiera sea la elección, ella no surtirá efecto retroactivo respecto de esta Licencia (o cualquier otra Licencia que haya sido otorgada, o le haya sido exigida, bajo los términos de ésta). La Licencia revocada continuará siendo plenamente vigente y efectiva si no se le da término en las condiciones indicadas anteriormente.
8. Varios.
Cada vez que Usted distribuya o ponga a disposición pública la Obra o una Obra Colectiva, el Licenciante ofrecerá al destinatario una licencia en los mismos términos y condiciones que la licencia otorgada a Usted bajo esta Licencia.
Cada vez que Usted distribuya o ponga a disposición pública una Obra Derivada, el Licenciante ofrecerá al destinatario una licencia para la Obra originaria en los mismos términos y condiciones garantizadas por la licencia que le ha sido otorgada a Usted bajo esta Licencia.
Si alguna disposición de esta Licencia resulta invalidada o no exigible, según la legislación vigente, esto no afectará ni la validez ni la aplicabilidad del resto de condiciones de esta Licencia y, sin acción adicional por parte de los sujetos de este acuerdo, aquélla se entenderá reformada lo mínimo necesario para hacer que dicha disposición sea válida y exigible.
Ningún término o disposición de esta Licencia se estimará renunciada y ninguna violación de ella será consentida a menos que esa renuncia o consentimiento sea otorgado por escrito y firmado por la parte que renuncie o consienta.
Esta Licencia refleja el acuerdo pleno entre las partes respecto a la Obra aquí licenciada. No hay arreglos, acuerdos o declaraciones respecto a la Obra que no estén especificados en este documento. El Licenciante no se verá limitado por ninguna disposición adicional que pueda surgir en alguna comunicación emanada de Usted. Esta Licencia no puede ser modificada sin el consentimiento mutuo por escrito del Licenciante y Usted.
Creative Commons no es parte de esta Licencia y no ofrece ninguna garantía en relación con la Obra. Creative Commons no será responsable frente a Usted o frente a cualquier otra parte respecto a reclamación alguna por daños, incluyendo, sin limitaciones, responsabilidad extracontractual o contractual, objetiva o subjetiva, se trate de daños morales o patrimoniales, directos o indirectos, previstos o imprevistos originados en relación con esta licencia. No obstante lo anterior, si Creative Commons se ha identificado expresamente a sí mismo como Licenciante, tendrá los mismos derechos y obligaciones correspondientes a todo Licenciante.
Salvo con el propósito limitado de indicar al público que la Obra está licenciada bajo la Licencia Creative Commons, ninguna de las partes hará uso de la marca registrada “Creative Commons” o cualquier otra marca registrada relacionada con ella o el logotipo de Creative Commons sin el consentimiento previo por escrito de Creative Commons. Cualquier uso autorizado será en conformidad con las directrices de uso de la marca registrada “Creative Commons” vigentes en ese momento, tal como se encuentren publicadas en su sitio web o que por otra forma se hayan puesto a disposición por petición expresa.

Lizenzvertrag
DAS URHEBERRECHTLICH GESCHÜTZTE WERK ODER DER SONSTIGE SCHUTZGEGENSTAND (WIE UNTEN BESCHRIEBEN) WIRD UNTER DEN BEDINGUNGEN DIESER CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE („CCPL“ ODER „LIZENZVERTRAG“) ZUR VERFÜGUNG GESTELLT. DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER EINSCHLÄGIGE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT.
DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINES DURCH DIESEN LIZENZVERTRAG GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH EINVERSTANDEN. DER LIZENZGEBER RÄUMT IHNEN DIE HIER BESCHRIEBENEN RECHTE UNTER DER VORAUSSETZUNGEIN, DASS SIE SICH MIT DIESEN VERTRAGSBEDINGUNGEN EINVERSTANDEN ERKLÄREN.
1. Definitionen
Unter einer „Bearbeitung“ wird eine Übersetzung oder andere Bearbeitung des Werkes verstanden, die Ihre persönliche geistige Schöpfung  ist. Eine freie Benutzung des Werkes wird nicht als Bearbeitung angesehen.
Unter den „Lizenzelementen“ werden die folgenden Lizenzcharakteristika verstanden, die vom Lizenzgeber ausgewählt und  in der Bezeichnung  der Lizenz genannt werden: „Namensnennung“, „Nicht-kommerziell“, „Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen“.
Unter dem „Lizenzgeber“ wird die natürliche oder juristische Person verstanden, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet.
Unter einem „Sammelwerk“ wird eine Sammlung von Werken, Daten oder anderen unabhängigen Elementen verstanden, die aufgrund der Auswahl oder Anordnung der Elemente eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung ist. Darunter fallen auch solche Sammelwerke, deren Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angeordnet und einzeln mit Hilfe elektronischer Mittel oder auf andere Weise zugänglich sind (Datenbankwerke). Ein Sammelwerk wird im Zusammenhang mit dieser Lizenz nicht als Bearbeitung (wie oben beschrieben) angesehen.
Mit „SIE“ und „Ihnen“ ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte ausübt und die zuvor die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz im Hinblick auf das Werk nicht verletzt hat, oder die die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz einer vorherigen Verletzung auszuüben.
f. Unter dem  „Schutzgegenstand“wird  das Werk oder Sammelwerk oder das Schutzobjekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts, das Ihnen unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird, verstanden
Unter dem „Urheber“ wird die natürliche Person verstanden, die das Werk geschaffen hat.
Unter einem „verwandten Schutzrecht“ wird das Recht an einem anderen urheberrechtlichen Schutzgegenstand als einem Werk verstanden, zum Beispiel einer wissenschaftlichen Ausgabe, einem nachgelassenen Werk, einem Lichtbild, einer Datenbank, einem Tonträger, einer Funksendung, einem Laufbild oder einer Darbietung eines ausübenden Künstlers.
Unter dem „Werk“ wird eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung verstanden, die Ihnen unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird.
2. Schranken des Urheberrechts. Diese Lizenz lässt sämtliche Befugnisse unberührt, die sich aus den Schranken des Urheberrechts,aus dem Erschöpfungsgrundsatz oder anderen Beschränkungen der Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung. Unter den Bedingungen dieses Lizenzvertrages räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber ein lizenzgebührenfreies, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts) unbeschränktes einfaches Nutzungsrecht ein, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art und Weise zu nutzen:
den Schutzgegenstand in körperlicher Form zu verwerten, insbesondere zu vervielfältigen, zu verbreiten und auszustellen;
den Schutzgegenstand in unkörperlicher Form öffentlich wiederzugeben, insbesondere vorzutragen, aufzuführen und vorzuführen, öffentlich zugänglich zu machen, zu senden, durch Bild- und Tonträger wiederzugeben sowie Funksendungen und öffentliche Zugänglichmachungen wiederzugeben;
den Schutzgegenstand auf Bild- oder Tonträger aufzunehmen, Lichtbilder davon herzustellen, weiterzusenden und in dem in a. und b. genannten Umfang zu verwerten;
den Schutzgegenstand zu bearbeiten oder in anderer Weise umzugestalten und die Bearbeitungen zu veröffentlichen und in dem in a. bis c. genannten Umfang zu verwerten;
Die genannten Nutzungsrechte können für alle bekannten Nutzungsarten ausgeübt werden. Die genannten Nutzungsrechte beinhalten das Recht, solche Veränderungen an dem Werk vorzunehmen, die technisch erforderlich sind, um die Nutzungsrechte für alle Nutzungsarten wahrzunehmen. Insbesondere sind davon die Anpassung an andere Medien und auf andere Dateiformate umfasst.
4. Beschränkungen. Die Einräumung der Nutzungsrechte gemäß Ziffer 3 erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, und Sie müssen stets eine Kopie oder die vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) dieser Lizenz beifügen, wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstandvervielfältigen, verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie dürfen keine Vertragsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Rechte ändern oder beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Sie müssen alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand mit keinen technischen Schutzmaßnahmen versehen, die den Zugang oder den Gebrauch des Schutzgegenstandes in einer Weise kontrollieren, die mit den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz im Widerspruch stehen. Die genannten Beschränkungen gelten auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet; sie verlangen aber nicht, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt zum Gegenstand dieser Lizenz gemacht wird. Wenn Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers oder Urhebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk jeglichen Hinweis auf diesen Lizenzgeber oder diesen Urheber entfernen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand bearbeiten, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist- auf die Aufforderung eines Rechtsinhabers hin  von der Bearbeitung jeglichen Hinweis auf diesen Rechtsinhaber entfernen.
Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand oder eine Bearbeitung oder ein Sammelwerk vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Urhebervermerke für den Schutzgegenstand unverändert lassen und die Urheberschaft oder Rechtsinhaberschaft in einer der von Ihnen vorgenommenen Nutzung angemessenen Form anerkennen, indem Sie den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Urhebers oder Rechteinhabers nennen, wenn dieser angegeben ist. Dies gilt auch für den Titel des Schutzgegenstandes, wenn dieser angeben ist, sowie - in einem vernünftigerweise durchführbaren Umfang - für die mit dem Schutzgegenstand zu verbindende Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI), wie sie der Lizenzgeber angegeben hat, sofern dies geschehen ist, es sei denn, diese Internetadresse verweist nicht auf den Urhebervermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zu dem  Schutzgegenstand. Bei einer Bearbeitung ist ein Hinweis darauf aufzuführen, in welcher Form der Schutzgegenstand in die Bearbeitung eingegangen ist (z.B. „Französische Übersetzung des ... (Werk) durch ... (Urheber)“ oder „Das Drehbuch beruht auf dem Werk des ... (Urheber)“). Ein solcher Hinweis kann in jeder angemessenen Weise erfolgen, wobei jedoch bei einer Bearbeitung, einer Datenbank oder einem Sammelwerk der Hinweis zumindest an gleicher Stelle und in ebenso auffälliger Weise zu erfolgen hat wie vergleichbare Hinweise auf andere Rechtsinhaber.
Obwohl die gemäss Ziffer 3 gewährten Nutzungsrechte in umfassender Weise
ausgeübt werden dürfen, findet diese Erlaubnis ihre gesetzliche Grenze in
den Persönlichkeitsrechten der Urheber und ausübenden Künstler, deren berechtigte geistige und persönliche Interessen bzw. deren Ansehen oder Ruf nicht dadurch gefährdet werden dürfen, dass ein Schutzgegenstand über das gesetzlich zulässige Maß hinaus beeinträchtigt wird. 
5. Gewährleistung. Sofern dies von den Vertragsparteien nicht anderweitig schriftlich vereinbart,, bietet der Lizenzgeber keine Gewährleistung für die erteilten Rechte, außer für den Fall, dass Mängel arglistig verschwiegen wurden. Für Mängel anderer Art, insbesondere bei der mangelhaften Lieferung von Verkörperungen des Schutzgegenstandes, richtet sich die Gewährleistung nach der Regelung, die die Person, die Ihnen den Schutzgegenstand zur Verfügung stellt, mit Ihnen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vereinbart, oder - wenn eine solche Regelung nicht getroffen wurde - nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften.
6. Haftung. Über die in Ziffer 5 genannte Gewährleistung hinaus haftet Ihnen der Lizenzgeber nur für Vorsatz und grobe Fahrlässigkeit.
7. Vertragsende
Dieser Lizenzvertrag und die durch ihn eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte enden automatisch bei jeder Verletzung der Vertragsbedingungen durch Sie. Für natürliche und juristische Personen, die von Ihnen eine Bearbeitung, eine Datenbank oder ein Sammelwerk unter diesen Lizenzbedingungen erhalten haben, gilt die Lizenz jedoch weiter, vorausgesetzt, diese natürlichen oder juristischen Personen erfüllen sämtliche Vertragsbedingungen. Die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 und 8 gelten bei einer Vertragsbeendigung fort.
Unter den oben genannten Bedingungen  erfolgt die Lizenz auf unbegrenzte Zeit (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts). Dennoch behält sich der Lizenzgeber das Recht vor, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen zu nutzen oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit zu beenden, vorausgesetzt, dass solche Handlungen nicht dem Widerruf dieser Lizenz dienen (oder jeder anderen Lizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz erfolgt ist oder erfolgen muss) und diese Lizenz wirksam bleibt, bis Sie unter den oben genannten Voraussetzungen endet.
8. Schlussbestimmungen
a. Jedes Mal, wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Erwerber eine Lizenz für den Schutzgegenstand unter denselben Vertragsbedingungen an, unter denen er Ihnen die Lizenz eingeräumt hat.
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung vervielfältigen, verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Erwerber eine Lizenz für den ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand unter denselben Vertragsbedingungen an, unter denen er Ihnen die Lizenz eingeräumt hat.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieses Lizenzvertrages unwirksam sein, so wird die Wirksamkeit der übrigen Lizenzbestimmungen dadurch nicht berührt, und an die Stelle der unwirksamen Bestimmung tritt eine Ersatzregelung, die dem mit der unwirksamen Bestimmung angestrebten Zweck am nächsten kommt.
Nichts soll dahingehend ausgelegt werden, dass auf eine Bestimmung dieses Lizenzvertrages verzichtet oder einer Vertragsverletzung zugestimmt wird, so lange ein solcher Verzicht oder eine solche Zustimmung nicht schriftlich vorliegen und von der verzichtenden oder zustimmenden Vertragspartei unterschrieben sind
Dieser Lizenzvertrag stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen den Vertragsparteien hinsichtlich des Schutzgegenstandes dar. Es gibt keine weiteren ergänzenden Vereinbarungen oder mündlichen Abreden im Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand. Der Lizenzgeber ist an keine zusätzlichen Abreden gebunden, die aus irgendeiner Absprache mit Ihnen entstehen könnten. Der Lizenzvertrag kann nicht ohne eine übereinstimmende schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen abgeändert werden.
Auf diesen Lizenzvertrag findet das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung.

1. Definicions
L'"obra" és la creació literària, artística o científica oferta sota els termes d'aquesta llicència.
L'"autor" és la persona o l'entitat creadora de l'obra.
Una "obra conjunta" és aquella obra susceptible de ser inclosa en alguna de les categories següents:
"Obra en col·laboració": obra creada com a resultat unitari de la col·laboració de diversos autors.
"Obra col·lectiva": obra creada per la iniciativa i sota la coordinació d'una persona física o jurídica, que l'edita i la difon amb el seu nom, i que està constituïda per aportacions de diversos autors, la contribució personal dels quals es fon en una creació única i autònoma, per a la qual ha estat concebuda, sense que sigui possible atribuir-los separadament un dret sobre el conjunt de l'obra realitzada.
"Obra composta i independent": obra nova que incorpora una obra preexistent sense la col·laboració de l'autor d'aquesta última.
Una "obra derivada" és aquella que es basa en una obra o en unes obres preexistents -com per exemple: les traduccions i adaptacions; les revisions, actualitzacions i anotacions; els compendis, resums i extractes; els arranjaments musicals i, en general, qualsevol transformació d'una obra literària, artística o científica-, sempre que l'obra resultant no tingui el caràcter d'obra conjunta. Per exemple, si la obra consisteix en una composició musical o en un enregistrament de sons, la sincronització temporal de l'obra amb una imatge en moviment (synching) serà considerada com una obra derivada als efectes d'aquesta llicència.
Es consideraran "obres audiovisuals" les creacions expressades mitjançant una sèrie d'imatges associades, amb o sense sonorització incorporada, així com les composicions musicals, que estiguin essencialment destinades a ser difoses a través d'aparells de projecció o per qualsevol altre mitjà de comunicació pública de la imatge i del so, independentment de la naturalesa dels suports materials d'aquestes obres.
El "llicenciador" és la persona o l'entitat que ofereix l'obra sota els termes d'aquesta llicència i que en cedeix els drets d'explotació conforme al que s'hi disposa.
"Vós" sou la persona o l'entitat que exerceix els drets cedits mitjançant aquesta llicència i que prèviament no hagi violat els termes d'aquesta llicència respecte a l'obra, o que hagi rebut un permís exprés del llicenciador per exercir els drets cedits mitjançant aquesta llicència a pesar d'una violació anterior.
La "transformació" d'una obra comprèn la traducció, l'adaptació i qualsevol altra modificació de la qual derivi una obra diferent. Quan es tracti d'una base de dades, tal con es defineix més endavant, reordenar-la també es considerarà una transformació. La creació resultant de la transformació d'una obra tindrà la consideració d'obra derivada.
S'entén per "reproducció" la fixació de l'obra en un mitjà que en permeti la comunicació i l'obtenció de còpies de tota l'obra o d'una part.
S'entén per "distribució" el fet de posar a disposició del públic l'original o còpies de l'obra mitjançant la venda, el lloguer, el préstec o qualsevol altre sistema.
S'entén per "comunicació pública" qualsevol acte mitjançant el qual una pluralitat de persones pot tenir accés a l'obra sense que se'ls hagi fet una distribució prèvia d'exemplars. No es considerarà pública, aquella comunicació que es faci dins d'un àmbit estrictament domèstic que no estigui integrat o connectat a una xarxa de difusió de qualsevol tipus. Als efectes d'aquesta llicència es considerarà comunicació pública el fet de posar l'obra a disposició del públic, ja sigui per procediments electrònics amb fil o sense fil. S'hi inclou també el fet de posar l'obra a disposició del públic de manera que qualsevol persona pugui accedir-hi des d'on vulgui i quan vulgui.
L'"explotació" de l'obra comprèn la reproducció, la distribució, la comunicació pública i la transformació.
Es consideraran "bases de dades" les col·leccions d'obres alienes, de dades o d'altres elements independents -com ara les antologies i les bases de dades pròpiament dites- que, per la selecció o disposició de seus continguts, constitueixin creacions intel·lectuals, sense perjudici, en aquest cas, dels drets que puguin subsistir sobre aquests continguts.
Els "elements de la llicència" són les característiques principals de la llicència segons la selecció feta pel llicenciador i indicades anteriorment en el títol: reconeixement d'autoria (Reconeixement).
2. Límits i ús legítim dels drets. No hi ha res en aquesta llicència que pretengui reduir o restringir qualsevol dels límits legals dels drets exclusius del titular dels drets de propietat intel·lectual d'acord amb la Llei de propietat intel·lectual o qualsevol altra normativa aplicable, ja siguin drets derivats d'usos legítims -com ara el dret de còpia privada o el dret de cita- o altres limitacions -com la que deriva de la primera venda d'exemplars.
3. Concessió de llicència.Conforme a les condicions d'aquesta llicència, el llicenciador concedeix (durant tota la vigència dels drets de propietat intel·lectual) una llicència d'àmbit mundial, sense dret de remuneració, no exclusiva i indefinida, que inclou la cessió dels drets següents:
Dret de reproducció, distribució i comunicació pública de l'obra.
Dret a incorporar l'obra en una o més obres conjuntes o bases de dades, i dret a reproduir-la incorporada en aquestes obres conjuntes o bases de dades.
Dret a efectuar qualsevol transformació de l'obra, i crear i reproduir obres derivades.
Dret de distribució i comunicació pública de còpies o d'enregistraments de l'obra, incorporada en obres conjuntes o bases de dades.
Dret de distribució i comunicació pública de còpies o d'enregistraments de l'obra, mitjançant una obra derivada.
Per evitar dubtes, sense perjudici de l'autorització preceptiva del llicenciador, i especialment quan l'obra sigui una obra audiovisual, el llicenciador es reserva el dret exclusiu de percebre, tant individualment com mitjançant una entitat de gestió de drets, o diverses (per exemple: SGAE, Dama, VEGAP), els drets d'explotació de l'obra, així com els derivats d'obres derivades, conjuntes o bases de dades, si aquesta explotació té com a objectiu l'obtenció d'un benefici mercantil o una remuneració monetària privada.
Aquests drets es poden exercir en tots els mitjans i formats, tangibles o intangibles, coneguts o per conèixer. Els drets esmentats inclouen el dret a efectuar les modificacions que siguin tècnicament necessàries per exercir els drets en altres mitjans i formats. Tots aquells drets no cedits expressament pel llicenciador queden reservats.
4. Restriccions. La cessió de drets que suposa aquesta llicència està subjecta i limitada a les restriccions següents:
Podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra només sota els termes d'aquesta llicència i n'heu d'incloure una còpia, o el corresponent identificador uniforme de recursos (URI), en cada còpia o enregistrament de l'obra que reproduïu, distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament. No podeu oferir o imposar cap terme sobre l'obra que alteri o restringeixi els termes d'aquesta llicència o l'exercici dels drets per part dels seus cessionaris. No podeu subllicènciar l'obra. Heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos referents a aquesta llicència i a l'absència de garanties. No podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra amb mesures tecnològiques que controlin l'accés o l'ús de l'obra d'una manera contrària als termes d'aquesta llicència. Això últim s'aplica a una obra incorporada en una obra conjunta o base de dades, però no implica que aquestes, al marge de l'obra subjecta a aquesta llicència, hagin d'estar subjectes als mateixos termes. Si creeu una obra conjunta o base de dades, amb l'avís previ del llicenciador, haureu de treure de l'obra conjunta o base de dades qualsevol referència a l'esmentat llicenciador o a l'autor original, segons el que es requereixi i fins on sigui possible. Si creeu una obra derivada, amb l'avís previ del llicenciador, haureu de treure de l'obra derivada qualsevol referència a l'esmentat llicenciador o a l'autor original, segons el que es requereixi i fins on sigui possible.
Si reproduïu, distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament l'obra o qualsevol obra derivada, conjunta o base dades que la incorpori, heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos sobre la propietat intel·lectual de l'obra i reconèixer-ne l'autor original, de manera raonable conforme al mitjà o als mitjans que estigueu utilitzant, indicant-hi el nom (o el pseudònim, si és el cas) de l'autor original, si s'ha facilitat; el títol de l'obra, si s'ha facilitat; en la mesura que sigui possible i si n'hi ha, l'identificador uniforme de recursos (URI) vinculat a l'obra que el llicenciador hagi especificat, llevat que aquest URI no es refereixi a l'avís sobre propietat intel·lectual o a la informació sobre la llicència de l'obra. En el cas d'una obra derivada, caldrà que hi feu constar un avís que identifiqui l'ús de l'obra en l'obra derivada (per exemple, "traducció francesa de l'obra de l'autor original" o "guió basat en l'obra original de l'autor original"). Aquest avís es pot desenvolupar de qualsevol manera raonable a fi que, en el cas d'una obra derivada, conjunta o base de dades, hi aparegui de forma comparable als avisos corresponents a altres autors.
En el cas de la inclusió de l'obra en alguna base de dades o recopilació, el propietari o el gestor de la base de dades haurà de renunciar a qualsevol dret relacionat amb aquesta inclusió i als usos de l'obra un cop extreta de la base de dades, ja sigui de manera individual o conjuntament amb altres materials.
5. Absència de responsabilitat
LLEVAT QUE S'ACORDI MÚTUAMENT ENTRE LES PARTS, EL LLICENCIADOR OFEREIX L'OBRA TAL COM ÉS I NO CONFEREIX GARANTIA DE CAP MENA RESPECTE L'OBRA O LA PRESÈNCIA O ABSÈNCIA D'ERRORS QUE ES PUGUIN, O NO, DETECTAR. ALGUNES JURISDICCIONS NO PERMETEN L'EXCLUSIÓ D'AQUESTES GARANTIES, DE MANERA QUE AQUESTA EXCLUSIÓ POT NO SER APLICABLE EN EL VOSTRE CAS.
6. Limitació de responsabilidad.
LLEVAT QUE LA LLEI APLICABLE HO DISPOSI EXPRESSAMENT I IMPERATIVAMENT, EN CAP CAS EL LLICENCIADOR SERÀ RESPONSABLE DAVANT VOSTRE PER QUALSEVOL TEORIA LEGAL, DE QUALSEVOL DANY QUE EN PUGUI RESULTAR, TANT SI ÉS GENERAL COM ESPECIAL (INCLOSOS EL DANY EMERGENT I EL LUCRE CESSANT), FORTUÏT O CAUSAL, DIRECTE O INDIRECTE, PRODUÏT PER L'ÚS DE L'OBRA DURANT EL PERÍODE EN QUE S'EXTÈN AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA, ENCARA QUE EL LLICENCIADOR HAGUÉS ESTAT INFORMAT DE LA POSSIBILITAT D'AQUESTS DANYS.
7. Finalització de la llicència
Aquesta llicència i la cessió dels drets que conté acabaran automàticament en cas que se n'incompleixi qualsevol dels termes. No obstant això, no s'anul·larà la llicència d'aquelles persones o entitats que hagin rebut obres derivades, conjuntes o bases de dades vostres sota aquesta llicència, sempre que aquestes persones o entitats es mantinguin en el compliment íntegre d'aquesta llicència. Les seccions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, i 8 continuaran vigents malgrat que finalitzi aquesta llicència.
Conforme a les condicions anteriors, la cessió de drets d'aquesta llicència és perpètua (durant tota la vigència dels drets de propietat intel·lectual aplicables a l'obra). Malgrat això, el llicenciador es reserva el dret a divulgar o publicar l'obra en condicions diferents a les presents, o aretirar l'obra en qualsevol moment. Tanmateix, això no suposarà donar per conclosa aquesta llicència (o qualsevol altra llicència que hagi estat concedida, o calgui concedir, sota els termes d'aquesta llicència), sinó que continuarà vigent i amb efectes complets, a menys que no hagi finalitzat conforme allò establert anteriorment.
8. Qüestions diverses
Cada vegada que exploteu d'alguna manera l'obra, l'obra conjunta o la base de dades que la incorpori, haureu de cedir els drets d'explotació mitjançant una llicència sobre l'obra original, en les mateixes condicions que la llicència que us ha estat concedida.
Cada vegada que exploteu d'alguna manera una obra derivada, haurà de cedir els drets d'explotació mitjançant una llicència sobre l'obra que heu creat, en les mateixes condicions i termes que la llicència que us ha estat concedida.
Si alguna disposició d'aquesta llicència resulta invàlida o inaplicable segons la llei vigent, això no afectarà la validesa o l'aplicabilitat de la resta dels termes d'aquesta llicència i, sense cap acció addicional per a qualsevol de les parts d'aquest acord, aquesta disposició s'entendrà reformada en allò estrictament necessari per fer que aquesta disposició sigui vàlida i executiva.
No s'entendrà que existeix renúncia pel que fa a algun terme o disposició d'aquesta llicència, ni que se'n consent cap violació, a menys que aquesta renúncia o consentiment figuri per escrit i sigui firmada per la part que renuncia o que consent.
Aquesta llicència constitueix l'acord ple entre les parts respecte l'objecte de la llicència. No hi ha interpretacions, acords o condicions respecte l'obra que no s'especifiquin expressament en aquesta llicència. El llicenciador no estarà obligat per cap disposició complementària que pugui aparèixer en qualsevol comunicació vosra. Aquesta llicència no es pot modificar sense que ho acordeu per escrit amb el llicenciador.
Creative Commons no és part d'aquesta llicència, i no ofereix cap garantia en relació amb l'obra. Creative Commons no serà responsable davant vostre -o qualsevol part- i per qualsevol teoria legal, de danys de qualsevol tipus, tant si són generals o especials (inclosos el dany emergent i el lucre cessant), com fortuïts o causals, que estiguin relacionats amb aquesta llicència. A pesar de las dues oracions anteriors, si Creative Commons s'identifica expressament com a llicenciador, tindrà tots els drets i obligacions del llicenciador.
Llevat del propòsit limitat d'indicar al públic que l'obra està sota una llicència CCPL, cap part utilitzarà la marca registrada Creative Commons o qualsevol altra marca registrada o insígnia relacionada amb Creative Commons sense el seu consentiment per escrit. Qualsevol ús permès es farà conforme a les pautes vigents en cada moment sobre l'ús de la marca registrada per Creative Commons, publicades en el seu espai web o proporcionades sota petició prèvia.

QUEDA PROHIBIDO CUALQUIER USO DE LA OBRA DIFERENTE A LO AUTORIZADO BAJO ESTA LICENCIA O LO DISPUESTO EN LAS LEYES DE PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL.
MEDIANTE EL EJERCICIO DE CUALQUIER DERECHO SOBRE LA OBRA, USTED ACEPTA Y CONSIENTE LAS LIMITACIONES Y OBLIGACIONES DE ESTA LICENCIA. EL LICENCIADOR LE CEDE LOS DERECHOS CONTENIDOS EN ESTA LICENCIA, SIEMPRE QUE USTED ACEPTE LOS PRESENTES TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES.
1. Definiciones
La "obra" es la creación literaria, artística o científica ofrecida bajo términos de esta licencia.
El "autor" es la persona o la entidad que creó la obra.
Se considerará "obra conjunta" aquella susceptible de ser incluida en alguna de las siguientes categorías:
"Obra en colaboración", entendiendo por tal aquella que sea resultado unitario de la colaboración de varios autores.
"Obra colectiva", entendiendo por tal la creada por la iniciativa y bajo la coordinación de una persona natural o jurídica que la edite y divulgue bajo su nombre y que esté constituida por la reunión de aportaciones de diferentes autores cuya contribución personal se funde en una creación única y autónoma, para la cual haya sido concebida sin que sea posible atribuir separadamente a cualquiera de ellos un derecho sobre el conjunto de la obra realizada.
"Obra compuesta e independiente", entendiendo por tal, la obra nueva que incorpore una obra preexistente sin la colaboración del autor de esta última.
Se considerará "obra derivada" aquella que se encuentre basada en una obra o en una obra y otras preexistentes, tales como: las traducciones y adaptaciones; las revisiones, actualizaciones y anotaciones; los compendios, resúmenes y extractos; los arreglos musicales y; en general, cualesquiera transformaciones de una obra literaria, artística o científica, salvo que la obra resultante tenga el carácter de obra conjunta en cuyo caso no será considerada como una obra derivada a los efectos de esta licencia. Para evitar la duda, si la obra consiste en una composición musical o grabación de sonidos, la sincronización temporal de la obra con una imagen en movimiento ("synching") será considerada como una obra derivada a los efectos de esta licencia.
Tendrán la consideración de "obras audiovisuales" las creaciones expresadas mediante una serie de imágenes asociadas, con o sin sonorización incorporada, así como las composiciones musicales, que estén destinadas esencialmente a ser mostradas a través de aparatos de proyección o por cualquier otro medio de comunicación pública de la imagen y del sonido, con independencia de la naturaleza de los soportes materiales de dichas obras.
El "licenciador" es la persona o la entidad que ofrece la obra bajo términos de esta licencia y le cede los derechos de explotación de la misma conforme a lo dispuesto en ella.
"Usted" es la persona o la entidad que ejercita los derechos cedidos mediante esta licencia y que no ha violado previamente los términos de la misma con respecto a la obra, o que ha recibido el permiso expreso del licenciador de ejercitar los derechos cedidos mediante esta licencia a pesar de una violación anterior.
La "transformación" de una obra comprende su traducción, adaptación y cualquier otra modificación en su forma de la que se derive una obra diferente. Cuando se trate de una base de datos según se define más adelante, se considerará también transformación la reordenación de la misma. La creación resultante de la transformación de una obra tendrá la consideración de obra derivada.
Se entiende por "reproducción" la fijación de la obra en un medio que permita su comunicación y la obtención de copias de toda o parte de ella.
Se entiende por "distribución" la puesta a disposición del público del original o copias de la obra mediante su venta, alquiler, préstamo o de cualquier otra forma.
Se entenderá por "comunicación pública" todo acto por el cual una pluralidad de personas pueda tener acceso a la obra sin previa distribución de ejemplares a cada una de ellas. No se considerará pública la comunicación cuando se celebre dentro de un ámbito estrictamente doméstico que no esté integrado o conectado a una red de difusión de cualquier tipo. A efectos de esta licencia se considerará comunicación pública la puesta a disposición del público de la obra por procedimientos alámbricos o inalámbricos, incluida la puesta a disposición del público de la obra de tal forma que cualquier persona pueda acceder a ella desde el lugar y en el momento que elija.
La "explotación" de la obra comprende su reproducción, distribución, comunicación pública y transformación.
Tendrán la consideración de "bases de datos" las colecciones de obras ajenas, de datos o de otros elementos independientes como las antologías y las bases de datos propiamente dichas que por la selección o disposición de sus contenidos constituyan creaciones intelectuales, sin perjuicio, en su caso, de los derechos que pudieran subsistir sobre dichos contenidos.
Los "elementos de la licencia" son las características principales de la licencia según la selección efectuada por el licenciador e indicadas en el título de esta licencia: Reconocimiento de autoría (Reconocimiento).
2. Límites y uso legítimo de los derechos. Nada en esta licencia pretende reducir o restringir cualesquiera límites legales de los derechos exclusivos del titular de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de acuerdo con la Ley de Propiedad Intelectual o cualesquiera otras leyes aplicables, ya sean derivados de usos legítimos, tales como el derecho de copia privada o el derecho a cita, u otras limitaciones como la derivada de la primera venta de ejemplares.
3. Concesión de licencia. Conforme a los términos y a las condiciones de esta licencia, el licenciador concede (durante toda la vigencia de los derechos de propiedad intelectual) una licencia de ámbito mundial, sin derecho de remuneración, no exclusiva e indefinida que incluye la cesión de los siguientes derechos:
Derecho de reproducción, distribución y comunicación pública sobre la obra;
Derecho a incorporarla en una o más obras conjuntas o bases de datos y para su reproducción en tanto que incorporada a dichas obras conjuntas o bases de datos;
Derecho para efectuar cualquier transformación la obra y crear y reproducir obras derivadas;
Derecho de distribución y comunicación pública de copias o grabaciones de la obra, como incorporada a obras conjuntas o bases de datos;
Derecho de distribución y comunicación pública de copias o grabaciones de la obra, por medio de una obra derivada.
Para evitar la duda, sin perjuicio de la preceptiva autorización del licenciador, y especialmente cuando la obra se trate de una obra audiovisual, el licenciador se reserva el derecho exclusivo a percibir, tanto individualmente como mediante una entidad de gestión de derechos, o varias, (por ejemplo: SGAE, Dama, VEGAP), los derechos de explotación de la obra, así como los derivados de obras derivadas, conjuntas o bases de datos, si dicha explotación pretende principalmente o se encuentra dirigida hacia la obtención de un beneficio mercantil o la remuneración monetaria privada.
Los anteriores derechos se pueden ejercitar en todos los medios y formatos, tangibles o intangibles, conocidos o por conocer. Los derechos mencionados incluyen el derecho a efectuar las modificaciones que sean precisas t�cnicamente para el ejercicio de los derechos en otros medios y formatos. Todos los derechos no cedidos expresamente por el licenciador quedan reservados.
4. Restricciones. La cesión de derechos que supone esta licencia se encuentra sujeta y limitada a las restricciones siguientes:
Usted puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra solamente bajo términos de esta licencia y debe incluir una copia de la misma, o su Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI), con cada copia o grabación de la obra que usted reproduzca, distribuya o comunique públicamente. Usted no puede ofrecer o imponer ningún término sobre la obra que altere o restrinja los términos de esta licencia o el ejercicio de sus derechos por parte de los cesionarios de la misma. Usted no puede sublicenciar la obra. Usted debe mantener intactos todos los avisos que se refieran a esta licencia y a la ausencia de garantías. Usted no puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra con medidas tecnológicas que controlen el acceso o uso de la obra de una manera contraria a los términos de esta licencia. Lo anterior se aplica a una obra en tanto que incorporada a una obra conjunta o base de datos, pero no implica que éstas, al margen de la obra objeto de esta licencia, tengan que estar sujetas a los términos de la misma. Si usted crea una obra conjunta o base de datos, previa comunicación del licenciador, usted deberá quitar de la obra conjunta o base de datos cualquier referencia a dicho licenciador o al autor original, según lo que se le requiera y en la medida de lo posible. Si usted crea una obra derivada, previa comunicación del licenciador, usted deberá quitar de la obra derivada cualquier referencia a dicho licenciador o al autor original, lo que se le requiera y en la medida de lo posible.
Si usted reproduce, distribuye o comunica públicamente la obra o cualquier obra derivada, conjunta o base datos que la incorpore, usted debe mantener intactos todos los avisos sobre la propiedad intelectual de la obra y reconocer al autor original, de manera razonable conforme al medio o a los medios que usted esté utilizando, indicando el nombre (o el seudónimo, en su caso) del autor original si es facilitado; el título de la obra si es facilitado; de manera razonable, el Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI), si existe, que el licenciador especifica para ser vinculado a la obra, a menos que tal URI no se refiera al aviso sobre propiedad intelectual o a la información sobre la licencia de la obra; y en el caso de una obra derivada, un aviso que identifique el uso de la obra en la obra derivada (e.g., "traducción francesa de la obra de Autor Original," o "guión basado en obra original de Autor Original"). Tal aviso se puede desarrollar de cualquier manera razonable; con tal de que, sin embargo, en el caso de una obra derivada, conjunta o base datos, aparezca como mínimo este aviso allá donde aparezcan los avisos correspondientes a otros autores y de forma comparable a los mismos.
En el caso de la inclusión de la obra en alguna base de datos o recopilación, el propietario o el gestor de la base de datos tiene que renunciar a cualquier derecho relacionado con esta inclusión y concerniente a los usos de la obra una vez extraída de les bases de datos, ya sea de manera individual o conjuntamente con otros materiales.
5. Ausencia de responsabilidad
A MENOS QUE SE ACUERDE MUTUAMENTE ENTRE LAS PARTES, EL LICENCIADOR OFRECE LA OBRA TAL CUAL (ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS) Y NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA DE CUALQUIER TIPO RESPECTO DE LA OBRA O DE LA PRESENCIA O AUSENCIA DE ERRORES QUE PUEDAN O NO SER DESCUBIERTOS. ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE TALES GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PUEDE NO SER DE APLICACIÓN A USTED.
6. Limitación de responsabilidad.
SALVO QUE LO DISPONGA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE LA LEY APLICABLE, EN NINGÚN CASO EL LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSABLE ANTE USTED POR CUALQUIER TEORÍA LEGAL DE CUALESQUIERA DAÑOS RESULTANTES, GENERALES O ESPECIALES (INCLUIDO EL DAÑO EMERGENTE Y EL LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUITOS O CAUSALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENCIA O EL USO DE LA OBRA, INCLUSO SI EL LICENCIADOR HUBIERA SIDO INFORMADO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE TALES DAÑOS.
7. Finalización de la licencia
Esta licencia y la cesión de los derechos que contiene terminarán automáticamente en caso de cualquier incumplimiento de los términos de la misma. Las personas o entidades que hayan recibido obras derivadas, conjuntas o bases de datos de usted bajo esta licencia, sin embargo, no verán sus licencias finalizadas, siempre que tales personas o entidades se mantengan en el cumplimiento íntegro de esta licencia. Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 permanecerán vigentes pese a cualquier finalización de esta licencia.
Conforme a las condiciones y términos anteriores, la cesión de derechos de esta licencia es perpetua (durante toda la vigencia de los derechos de propiedad intelectual aplicables a la obra). A pesar de lo anterior, el licenciador se reserva el derecho a divulgar o publicar la obra en condiciones distintas a las presentes, o de retirar la obra en cualquier momento. No obstante, ello no supondrá dar por concluida esta licencia (o cualquier otra licencia que haya sido concedida, o sea necesario ser concedida, bajo los términos de esta licencia), que continuará vigente y con efectos completos a no ser que haya finalizado conforme a lo establecido anteriormente.
8. Cuestiones diversas
Cada vez que usted explote de alguna forma la obra, o una obra conjunta o una base datos que la incorpore, deberá ceder los derechos de explotación mediante una licencia sobre la obra original en las mismas condiciones y términos que la licencia concedida a usted.
Cada vez que usted explote de alguna forma una obra derivada, deberá ceder los derechos de explotación mediante una licencia sobre la obra por usted creada en las mismas condiciones y términos que la licencia concedida a usted.
Si alguna disposición de esta licencia resulta inválida o inaplicable según la Ley vigente, ello no afectará la validez o aplicabilidad del resto de los términos de esta licencia y, sin ninguna acción adicional por cualquiera las partes de este acuerdo, tal disposición se entenderá reformada en lo estrictamente necesario para hacer que tal disposición sea válida y ejecutiva.
No se entenderá que existe renuncia respecto de algún término o disposición de esta licencia, ni que se consiente violación alguna de la misma, a menos que tal renuncia o consentimiento figure por escrito y lleve la firma por la parte que renuncie o consienta.
Esta licencia constituye el acuerdo pleno entre las partes con respecto a la obra objeto de la licencia. No caben interpretaciones, acuerdos o términos con respecto a la obra que no se encuentren expresamente especificados en la presente licencia. El licenciador no estará obligado por ninguna disposición complementaria que pueda aparecer en cualquier comunicación de usted. Esta licencia no se puede modificar sin el mutuo acuerdo por escrito entre el licenciador y usted.
Creative Commons no es parte de esta licencia, y no ofrece ninguna garantía en relación con la obra. Creative Commons no será responsable frente a usted o a cualquier parte, por cualquier teoría legal de cualesquiera daños resultantes, incluyendo, pero no limitado, daños generales o especiales (incluido el daño emergente y el lucro cesante), fortuitos o causales, en conexión con esta licencia.

Paternité - 2.0 
Creative Commons n'est pas un cabinet d'avocats et ne fournit pas de services de conseil juridique. La distribution de la présente version de ce contrat ne crée aucune relation juridique entre les parties au contrat présenté ci-après et Creative Commons. Creative Commons fournit cette offre de contrat-type en l'état, à seule fin d'information. Creative Commons ne saurait être tenu responsable des éventuels préjudices résultant du contenu ou de l'utilisation de ce contrat. 
Contrat
L'Oeuvre (telle que définie ci-dessous) est mise à disposition selon les termes du présent contrat appelé Contrat Public Creative Commons (dénommé ici « CPCC » ou « Contrat »). L'Oeuvre est protégée par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique (droit d'auteur, droits voisins, droits des producteurs de bases de données) ou toute autre loi applicable. Toute utilisation de l'Oeuvre autrement qu'explicitement autorisée selon ce Contrat ou le droit applicable est interdite.  L'exercice sur l'Oeuvre de tout droit proposé par le présent contrat vaut acceptation de celui-ci. Selon les termes et les obligations du présent contrat, la partie Offrante propose à la partie Acceptante l'exercice de certains droits présentés ci-après, et l'Acceptant en approuve les termes et conditions d'utilisation.  
1. Définitions
« Oeuvre » : oeuvre de l'esprit protégeable par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique ou toute loi applicable et qui est mise à disposition selon les termes du présent Contrat.
« Oeuvre dite Collective » : une oeuvre dans laquelle l'oeuvre, dans sa forme intégrale et non modifiée, est assemblée en un ensemble collectif avec d'autres contributions qui constituent en elles-mêmes des oeuvres séparées et indépendantes. Constituent notamment des Oeuvres dites Collectives les publications périodiques, les anthologies ou les encyclopédies. Aux termes de la présente autorisation, une oeuvre qui constitue une Oeuvre dite Collective ne sera pas considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée (telle que définie ci-après).
« Oeuvre dite Dérivée » : une oeuvre créée soit à partir de l'Oeuvre seule, soit à partir de l'Oeuvre et d'autres oeuvres préexistantes. Constituent notamment des Oeuvres dites Dérivées les traductions, les arrangements musicaux, les adaptations théâtrales, littéraires ou cinématographiques, les enregistrements sonores, les reproductions par un art ou un procédé quelconque, les résumés, ou toute autre forme sous laquelle l'Oeuvre puisse être remaniée, modifiée, transformée ou adaptée, à l'exception d'une oeuvre qui constitue une Oeuvre dite Collective. Une Oeuvre dite Collective ne sera pas considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée aux termes du présent Contrat. Dans le cas où l'Oeuvre serait une composition musicale ou un enregistrement sonore, la synchronisation de l'oeuvre avec une image animée sera considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée pour les propos de ce Contrat.
« Auteur original » : la ou les personnes physiques qui ont créé l'Oeuvre.
« Offrant » : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) qui proposent la mise à disposition de l'Oeuvre selon les termes du présent Contrat.
« Acceptant » : la personne physique ou morale qui accepte le présent contrat et exerce des droits sans en avoir violé les termes au préalable ou qui a reçu l'autorisation expresse de l'Offrant d'exercer des droits dans le cadre du présent contrat malgré une précédente violation de ce contrat.
2. Exceptions aux droits exclusifs. Aucune disposition de ce contrat n'a pour intention de réduire, limiter ou restreindre les prérogatives issues des exceptions aux droits, de l'épuisement des droits ou d'autres limitations aux droits exclusifs des ayants droit selon le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique ou les autres lois applicables.
3. Autorisation. Soumis aux termes et conditions définis dans cette autorisation, et ceci pendant toute la durée de protection de l'Oeuvre par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique ou le droit applicable, l'Offrant accorde à l'Acceptant l'autorisation mondiale d'exercer à titre gratuit et non exclusif les droits suivants :
reproduire l'Oeuvre, incorporer l'Oeuvre dans une ou plusieurs Oeuvres dites Collectives et reproduire l'Oeuvre telle qu'incorporée dans lesdites Oeuvres dites Collectives;
créer et reproduire des Oeuvres dites Dérivées;
distribuer des exemplaires ou enregistrements, présenter, représenter ou communiquer l'Oeuvre au public par tout procédé technique, y compris incorporée dans des Oeuvres Collectives;
distribuer des exemplaires ou phonogrammes, présenter, représenter ou communiquer au public des Oeuvres dites Dérivées par tout procédé technique;
lorsque l'Oeuvre est une base de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles de l'Oeuvre.
Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous les supports, médias, procédés techniques et formats. Les droits ci-dessus incluent le droit d'effectuer les modifications nécessaires techniquement à l'exercice des droits dans d'autres formats et procédés techniques. L'exercice de tous les droits qui ne sont pas expressément autorisés par l'Offrant ou dont il n'aurait pas la gestion demeure réservé, notamment les mécanismes de gestion collective obligatoire applicables décrits à l'article 4(c).
4. Restrictions. L'autorisation accordée par l'article 3 est expressément assujettie et limitée par le respect des restrictions suivantes :
L'Acceptant peut reproduire, distribuer, représenter ou communiquer au public l'Oeuvre y compris par voie numérique uniquement selon les termes de ce Contrat. L'Acceptant doit inclure une copie ou l'adresse Internet (Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource) du présent Contrat à toute reproduction ou enregistrement de l'Oeuvre que l'Acceptant distribue, représente ou communique au public y compris par voie numérique. L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation de l'Oeuvre qui altèrent ou restreignent les termes du présent Contrat ou l'exercice des droits qui y sont accordés au bénéficiaire. L'Acceptant ne peut pas céder de droits sur l'Oeuvre. L'Acceptant doit conserver intactes toutes les informations qui renvoient à ce Contrat et à l'exonération de responsabilité. L'Acceptant ne peut pas reproduire, distribuer, représenter ou communiquer au public l'Oeuvre, y compris par voie numérique, en utilisant une mesure technique de contrôle d'accès ou de contrôle d'utilisation qui serait contradictoire avec les termes de cet Accord contractuel. Les mentions ci-dessus s'appliquent à l'Oeuvre telle qu'incorporée dans une Oeuvre dite Collective, mais, en dehors de l'Oeuvre en elle-même, ne soumettent pas l'Oeuvre dite Collective, aux termes du présent Contrat. Si l'Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Collective, à la demande de tout Offrant, il devra, dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l'Oeuvre dite Collective toute référence au dit Offrant, comme demandé. Si l'Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Collective, à la demande de tout Auteur, il devra, dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l'Oeuvre dite Collective toute référence au dit Auteur, comme demandé. Si l'Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Dérivée, à la demande de tout Offrant, il devra, dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée toute référence au dit Offrant, comme demandé. Si l'Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Dérivée, à la demande de tout Auteur, il devra, dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée toute référence au dit Auteur, comme demandé.
Si l'Acceptant reproduit, distribue, représente ou communique au public, y compris par voie numérique, l'Oeuvre ou toute Oeuvre dite Dérivée ou toute Oeuvre dite Collective, il doit conserver intactes toutes les informations sur le régime des droits et en attribuer la paternité à l'Auteur Original, de manière raisonnable au regard au médium ou au moyen utilisé. Il doit communiquer le nom de l'Auteur Original ou son éventuel pseudonyme s'il est indiqué ; le titre de l'Oeuvre Originale s'il est indiqué ; dans la mesure du possible, l'adresse Internet ou Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource (URI), s'il existe, spécifié par l'Offrant comme associé à l'Oeuvre, à moins que cette adresse ne renvoie pas aux informations légales (paternité et conditions d'utilisation de l'Oeuvre). Dans le cas d'une Oeuvre dite Dérivée, il doit indiquer les éléments identifiant l'utilisation l'Oeuvre dans l'Oeuvre dite Dérivée par exemple « Traduction anglaise de l'Oeuvre par l'Auteur Original » ou « Scénario basé sur l'Oeuvre par l'Auteur Original ». Ces obligations d'attribution de paternité doivent être exécutées de manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas d'une Oeuvre dite Dérivée ou d'une Oeuvre dite Collective, ces informations doivent, au minimum, apparaître à la place et de manière aussi visible que celles à laquelle apparaissent les informations de même nature.
Dans le cas où une utilisation de l'Oeuvre serait soumise à un régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire, l'Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances par l'intermédiaire de la société de perception et de répartition des droits compétente. Sont notamment concernés la radiodiffusion et la communication dans un lieu public de phonogrammes publiés à des fins de commerce, certains cas de retransmission par câble et satellite, la copie privée d'Oeuvres fixées sur phonogrammes ou vidéogrammes, la reproduction par reprographie.
5. Garantie et exonération de responsabilité
En mettant l'Oeuvre à la disposition du public selon les termes de ce Contrat, l'Offrant déclare de bonne foi qu'à sa connaissance et dans les limites d'une enquête raisonnable :
L'Offrant a obtenu tous les droits sur l'Oeuvre nécessaires pour pouvoir autoriser l'exercice des droits accordés par le présent Contrat, et permettre la jouissance paisible et l'exercice licite de ces droits, ceci sans que l'Acceptant n'ait aucune obligation de verser de rémunération ou tout autre paiement ou droits, dans la limite des mécanismes de gestion collective obligatoire applicables décrits à l'article 4(e);
L'Oeuvre n'est constitutive ni d'une violation des droits de tiers, notamment du droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique, du droit des marques, du droit de l'information, du droit civil ou de tout autre droit, ni de diffamation, de violation de la vie privée ou de tout autre préjudice délictuel à l'égard de toute tierce partie.
A l'exception des situations expressément mentionnées dans le présent Contrat ou dans un autre accord écrit, ou exigées par la loi applicable, l'Oeuvre est mise à disposition en l'état sans garantie d'aucune sorte, qu'elle soit expresse ou tacite, y compris à l'égard du contenu ou de l'exactitude de l'Oeuvre.
6. Limitation de responsabilité. A l'exception des garanties d'ordre public imposées par la loi applicable et des réparations imposées par le régime de la responsabilité vis-à-vis d'un tiers en raison de la violation des garanties prévues par l'article 5 du présent contrat, l'Offrant ne sera en aucun cas tenu responsable vis-à-vis de l'Acceptant, sur la base d'aucune théorie légale ni en raison d'aucun préjudice direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, résultant de l'exécution du présent Contrat ou de l'utilisation de l'Oeuvre, y compris dans l'hypothèse où l'Offrant avait connaissance de la possible existence d'un tel préjudice.
7. Résiliation
Tout manquement aux termes du contrat par l'Acceptant entraîne la résiliation automatique du Contrat et la fin des droits qui en découlent. Cependant, le contrat conserve ses effets envers les personnes physiques ou morales qui ont reçu de la part de l'Acceptant, en exécution du présent contrat, la mise à disposition d'Oeuvres dites Dérivées, ou d'Oeuvres dites Collectives, ceci tant qu'elles respectent pleinement leurs obligations. Les sections 1, 2, 5, 6 et 7 du contrat continuent à s'appliquer après la résiliation de celui-ci.
Dans les limites indiquées ci-dessus, le présent Contrat s'applique pendant toute la durée de protection de l'Oeuvre selon le droit applicable. Néanmoins, l'Offrant se réserve à tout moment le droit d'exploiter l'Oeuvre sous des conditions contractuelles différentes, ou d'en cesser la diffusion; cependant, le recours à cette option ne doit pas conduire à retirer les effets du présent Contrat (ou de tout contrat qui a été ou doit être accordé selon les termes de ce Contrat), et ce Contrat continuera à s'appliquer dans tous ses effets jusqu'à ce que sa résiliation intervienne dans les conditions décrites ci-dessus.
8. Divers
A chaque reproduction ou communication au public par voie numérique de l'Oeuvre ou d'une Oeuvre dite Collective par l'Acceptant, l'Offrant propose au bénéficiaire une offre de mise à disposition de l'Oeuvre dans des termes et conditions identiques à ceux accordés à la partie Acceptante dans le présent Contrat.
A chaque reproduction ou communication au public par voie numérique d'une Oeuvre dite Dérivée par l'Acceptant, l'Offrant propose au bénéficiaire une offre de mise à disposition du bénéficiaire de l'Oeuvre originale dans des termes et conditions identiques à ceux accordés à la partie Acceptante dans le présent Contrat.
La nullité ou l'inapplicabilité d'une quelconque disposition de ce Contrat au regard de la loi applicable n'affecte pas celle des autres dispositions qui resteront pleinement valides et applicables. Sans action additionnelle par les parties à cet accord, lesdites dispositions devront être interprétées dans la mesure minimum nécessaire à leur validité et leur applicabilité.
Aucune limite, renonciation ou modification des termes ou dispositions du présent Contrat ne pourra être acceptée sans le consentement écrit et signé de la partie compétente.
Ce Contrat constitue le seul accord entre les parties à propos de l'Oeuvre mise ici à disposition. Il n'existe aucun élément annexe, accord supplémentaire ou mandat portant sur cette Oeuvre en dehors des éléments mentionnés ici. L'Offrant ne sera tenu par aucune disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une quelconque communication en provenance de l'Acceptant. Ce Contrat ne peut être modifié sans l'accord mutuel écrit de l'Offrant et de l'Acceptant.
Le droit applicable est le droit français.
Creative Commons n'est pas partie à ce Contrat et n'offre aucune forme de garantie relative à l'Oeuvre. Creative Commons décline toute responsabilité à l'égard de l'Acceptant ou de toute autre partie, quel que soit le fondement légal de cette responsabilité et quel que soit le préjudice subi, direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, qui surviendrait en rapport avec le présent Contrat. Cependant, si Creative Commons s'est expressément identifié comme Offrant pour mettre une Oeuvre à disposition selon les termes de ce Contrat, Creative Commons jouira de tous les droits et obligations d'un Offrant.
A l'exception des fins limitées à informer le public que l'Oeuvre est mise à disposition sous CPCC, aucune des parties n'utilisera la marque « Creative Commons » ou toute autre indication ou logo afférent sans le consentement préalable écrit de Creative Commons. Toute utilisation autorisée devra être effectuée en conformité avec les lignes directrices de Creative Commons à jour au moment de l'utilisation, telles qu'elles sont disponibles sur son site Internet ou sur simple demande.

Attribuzione 2.0 (ITALIA)
L’ASSOCIAZIONE CREATIVE COMMONS (DI SEGUITO ‘CREATIVE COMMONS’) NON È UNO STUDIO LEGALE E NON FORNISCE SERVIZI DI CONSULENZA LEGALE. LA DISTRIBUZIONE DI QUESTO MODELLO DI CONTRATTO DI LICENZA NON INSTAURA UN RAPPORTO AVVOCATO-CLIENTE. CREATIVE COMMONS FORNISCE INFORMAZIONI DA CONSIDERARSI “COSI’ COME SONO”. CREATIVE COMMONS NON PRESTA ALCUNA GARANZIA PER LE INFORMAZIONI FORNITE E SI ESIME DA OGNI RESPONSABILITÀ PER I DANNI DERIVANTI DALL’USO DELLE STESSE.
La Licenza
L’OPERA (COME SOTTO DEFINITA) È MESSA A DISPOSIZIONE SULLA BASE DEI TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA “CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE” (‘CCPL’ O ‘LICENZA’). L’OPERA È PROTETTA DAL DIRITTO D’AUTORE E/O DALLE ALTRE LEGGI APPLICABILI. OGNI UTILIZZAZIONE DELL’OPERA CHE NON SIA AUTORIZZATA AI SENSI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DEL DIRITTO D’AUTORE È PROIBITA.
CON IL SEMPLICE ESERCIZIO SULL’OPERA DI UNO QUALUNQUE DEI DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI, TU ACCETTI E TI OBBLIGHI A RISPETTARE INTEGRALMENTE I TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA AI SENSI DEL PUNTO 8.f. IL LICENZIANTE CONCEDE A TE I DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI A CONDIZIONE CHE TU ACCETTI DI RISPETTARE I TERMINI E LE CONDIZIONI DI CUI ALLA PRESENTE LICENZA.
1. Definizioni Ai fini e per gli effetti della presente licenza, si intende per
"Collezione di Opere" un’opera, come un numero di un periodico, un’antologia o un’enciclopedia, nella quale l’Opera nella sua interezza e forma originale, unitamente ad altri contributi costituenti loro stessi opere distinte ed autonome, sono raccolti in un’unità collettiva. Un’opera che costituisce Collezione di Opere non verrà considerata Opera Derivata (come sotto definita) ai fini della presente Licenza.
"Opera Derivata" un’opera basata sull’Opera ovvero sull’Opera insieme con altre opere preesistenti, come una traduzione, un arrangiamento musicale, un adattamento teatrale, narrativo, cinematografico, una registrazione di suoni, una riproduzione d’arte, un digesto, una sintesi, od ogni altra forma in cui l’Opera possa essere riproposta, trasformata o adattata. Nel caso in cui un’Opera tra quelle qui descritte costituisca già Collezione di Opere, essa non sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini della presente Licenza. Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, quando l’Opera sia una composizione musicale o registrazione di suoni, la sincronizzazione dell’Opera in relazione con un’immagine in movimento (“synching”) sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini di questa Licenza.
"Licenziante" l’individuo o l’ente che offre l’Opera secondo i termini e le condizioni della presente Licenza.
"Autore Originario" il soggetto che ha creato l’Opera.
"Opera" l’opera dell’ingegno suscettibile di protezione in forza delle leggi sul diritto d’autore, la cui utilizzazione è offerta nel rispetto dei termini della presente Licenza.
“Tu”/”Te” l’individuo o l’ente che esercita i diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza e che non abbia precedentemente violato i termini della presente Licenza relativi all’Opera, o che, nonostante una precedente violazione degli stessi, abbia ricevuto espressa autorizzazione dal Licenziante all’esercizio dei diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza.
2. Libere utilizzazioni. La presente Licenza non intende in alcun modo ridurre, limitare o restringere alcun diritto di libera utilizzazione o l’operare della regola dell’esaurimento del diritto o altre limitazioni dei diritti esclusivi sull’Opera derivanti dalla legge sul diritto d’autore o da altre leggi applicabili.
3. Concessione della Licenza. Nel rispetto dei termini e delle condizioni contenute nella presente Licenza, il Licenziante concede a Te una licenza per tutto il mondo, gratuita, non esclusiva e perpetua (per la durata del diritto d’autore applicabile) che autorizza ad esercitare i diritti sull’Opera qui di seguito elencati:
riproduzione dell’Opera, incorporazione dell’Opera in una o più Collezioni di Opere e riproduzione dell’Opera come incorporata nelle Collezioni di Opere;
creazione e riproduzione di un’Opera Derivata;
distribuzione di copie dell’Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l’Opera è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale dell’Opera, e ciò anche quando l’Opera sia incorporata in Collezioni di Opere;
distribuzione di copie dell’Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l’Opera Derivata è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale di Opere Derivate.
Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, se l’Opera sia di tipo musicale:
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione od esecuzione di opere incluse in repertori. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione od esecuzione, anche in forma digitale (ad es. tramite webcast) dell’Opera.
Compensi per versioni cover. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per ogni disco che Tu crei e distribuisci a partire dall’Opera (versione cover).
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico dell’Opera mediante fonogrammi. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che se l’Opera è una registrazione di suoni, il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. IMAIE), per la comunicazione al pubblico dell’Opera, anche in forma digitale.
Altri compensi previsti dalla legge italiana. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere i compensi a lui attribuiti dalla legge italiana sul diritto d’autore (ad es. per l’inserimento dell’Opera in un’antologia ad uso scolastico ex art. 70 l. 633/1941). Al Licenziante spettano in ogni caso i compensi irrinunciabili a lui attribuiti dalla medesima legge (ad es. l’equo compenso spettante all’autore di opere musicali, cinematografiche, audiovisive o di sequenze di immagini in movimento nel caso di noleggio ai sensi dell’art. 18-bis l. 633/1941).
I diritti sopra descritti potranno essere esercitati con ogni mezzo di comunicazione e in tutti i formati. Tra i diritti di cui sopra si intende compreso il diritto di apportare all’Opera le modifiche che si rendessero tecnicamente necessarie per l’esercizio di detti diritti tramite altri mezzi di comunicazione o su altri formati. Tutti i diritti non espressamente concessi dal Licenziante rimangono riservati.
4. Restrizioni. La Licenza concessa in conformità al precedente punto 3 è espressamente assoggettata a, e limitata da, le seguenti restrizioni:
Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera, anche in forma digitale, solo assicurando che i termini di cui alla presente Licenza siano rispettati e, insieme ad ogni copia dell’Opera (o supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l’Opera) che distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi proporre od imporre alcuna condizione relativa all’Opera che alteri o restringa i termini della presente Licenza o l’esercizio da parte del beneficiario dei diritti qui concessi. Non puoi concedere l’Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all’esclusione delle garanzie. Non puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera, neanche in forma digitale, usando misure tecnologiche miranti a controllare l’accesso all’Opera ovvero l’uso dell’Opera, in maniera incompatibile con i termini della presente Licenza. Quanto sopra si applica all’Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di per sé ed indipendentemente dall’Opera stessa debba essere soggetta ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante, devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente possibile, ogni riferimento a tale Licenziante o, su richiesta di qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale Autore Originario, come da richiesta. Qualora tu crei un’Opera Derivata, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall’Opera Derivata stessa, nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento a tale Licenziante o, su richiesta di qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale Autore Originario, come da richiesta.
Qualora Tu distribuisca, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegua, reciti o esponga in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, l’Opera o qualsiasi Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative sul diritto d’autore sull’Opera. Devi riconoscere all’Autore Originale una menzione adeguata rispetto al mezzo di comunicazione o supporto che utilizzi citando il nome (o lo pseudonimo, se del caso) dell’Autore Originale, ove fornito; il titolo dell’Opera, ove fornito; nella misura in cui sia ragionevolmente possibile, l’Uniform Resource Identifier, che il Licenziante specifichi dover essere associato con l’Opera, salvo che tale URI non faccia riferimento alla informazione di protezione di diritto d’autore o non dia informazioni sulla licenza dell’Opera; inoltre, in caso di Opera Derivata, devi menzionare l’uso dell’Opera nell’Opera Derivata (ad esempio, “traduzione francese dell’Opera dell’Autore Originario”, o “sceneggiatura basata sull’Opera originaria dell’Autore Originario”). Tale menzione deve essere realizzata in qualsiasi maniera ragionevole possibile; in ogni caso, in ipotesi di Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, tale menzione deve quantomeno essere posta nel medesimo punto dove viene indicato il nome di altri autori di rilevanza paragonabile e con lo stesso risalto concesso alla menzione di altri autori di rilevanza paragonabile.
5. Dichiarazioni, Garanzie ed Esonero da responsabilità
SALVO CHE SIA ESPRESSAMENTE CONVENUTO ALTRIMENTI PER ISCRITTO FRA LE PARTI, IL LICENZIANTE OFFRE L’OPERA IN LICENZA “COSI’ COM’E’” E NON FORNISCE ALCUNA DICHIARAZIONE O GARANZIA DI QUALSIASI TIPO CON RIGUARDO ALL’OPERA, SIA ESSA ESPRESSA OD IMPLICITA, DI FONTE LEGALE O DI ALTRO TIPO, ESSENDO QUINDI ESCLUSE, FRA LE ALTRE, LE GARANZIE RELATIVE AL TITOLO, ALLA COMMERCIABILITÀ, ALL’IDONEITÀ PER UN FINE SPECIFICO E ALLA NON VIOLAZIONE DI DIRITTI DI TERZI O ALLA MANCANZA DI DIFETTI LATENTI O DI ALTRO TIPO, ALL’ESATTEZZA OD ALLA PRESENZA DI ERRORI, SIANO ESSI ACCERTABILI O MENO. ALCUNE GIURISDIZIONI NON CONSENTONO L’ESCLUSIONE DI GARANZIE IMPLICITE E QUINDI TALE ESCLUSIONE PUÒ NON APPLICARSI A TE.
6. Limitazione di Responsabilità. SALVI I LIMITI STABILITI DALLA LEGGE APPLICABILE, IL LICENZIANTE NON SARÀ IN ALCUN CASO RESPONSABILE NEI TUOI CONFRONTI A QUALUNQUE TITOLO PER ALCUN TIPO DI DANNO, SIA ESSO SPECIALE, INCIDENTALE, CONSEQUENZIALE, PUNITIVO OD ESEMPLARE, DERIVANTE DALLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DALL’USO DELL’OPERA, ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL LICENZIANTE SIA STATO EDOTTO SULLA POSSIBILITÀ DI TALI DANNI. NESSUNA CLAUSOLA DI QUESTA LICENZA ESCLUDE O LIMITA LA RESPONSABILITA’ NEL CASO IN CUI QUESTA DIPENDA DA DOLO O COLPA GRAVE.
7. Risoluzione
La presente Licenza si intenderà risolta di diritto e i diritti con essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente, senza necessità di alcuna comunicazione in tal senso da parte del Licenziante, in caso di qualsivoglia inadempimento dei termini della presente Licenza da parte Tua, ed in particolare delle disposizioni di cui ai punti 4.a e 4.b, essendo la presente Licenza condizionata risolutivamente al verificarsi di tali inadempimenti. In ogni caso, la risoluzione della presente Licenza non pregiudicherà i diritti acquistati da individui o enti che abbiano acquistato da Te Opere Derivate o Collezioni di Opere, ai sensi della presente Licenza, a condizione che tali individui o enti continuino a rispettare integralmente le licenze di cui sono parte. Le sezioni 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 rimangono valide in presenza di qualsiasi risoluzione della presente Licenza.
Sempre che vengano rispettati i termini e le condizioni di cui sopra, la presente Licenza è perpetua (e concessa per tutta la durata del diritto d’autore sull’Opera applicabile). Nonostante ciò, il Licenziante si riserva il diritto di rilasciare l’Opera sulla base dei termini di una differente licenza o di cessare la distribuzione dell’Opera in qualsiasi momento; fermo restando che, in ogni caso, tali decisioni non comporteranno recesso dalla presente Licenza (o da qualsiasi altra licenza che sia stata concessa, o che sia richiesto che venga concessa, ai termini della presente Licenza), e la presente Licenza continuerà ad avere piena efficacia, salvo che vi sia risoluzione come sopra indicato.

본 이용허락은 이용허락자가 선정하고 본 이용허락의 표지에 표시되어 있는 저작자의 표시(Attribution)에 바탕을 둔 본 이용허락의 조건에 따라 저작물을 이용할 수 있습니다.
2. 저작권의 제한

3. 이용허락
본 이용허락의 조건에 따라 이용허락자는, 다음과 같이 (저작권의 존속기간동안) 귀하가 저작물을 이용하도록, 저작물의 전세계적, 무상, 비배타적, 영구적인 이용을 허락합니다.

4. 이용허락의 제한
제3조에 의하여 허여된 이용허락은 다음의 사항에 의하여 명시적으로 제한을 받습니다.
귀하는 본 이용허락의 조건에 따라서만 저작물을 배포, 전송, 전시, 공연 및 방송할 수 있으며, 귀하가 배포, 전송, 전시, 공연 및 방송하는 모든 저작물의 복제물이나 음반에 본 이용허락서의 복제물이나 이에 대한 통일자원식별부호(Uniform Resource Identifier)를 포함시켜야 합니다. 귀하는 본 이용허락의 조건을 변경·제한하거나 배포 등의 상대방에 의한 본 이용허락상의 권리행사를 변경·제한하는 조건을 제공하거나 부과할 수 없습니다. 귀하는 귀하가 이용허락받은 저작물을 다시 이용허락할 수 없습니다. 귀하는 본 이용허락 및 보증의 부인에 대한 모든 표시를 제거 또는 변경시켜서는 안 됩니다. 귀하는 본 이용허락의 조건을 위반하는 방식으로 저작물에 대한 접근이나 저작물의 이용을 통제하는 기술적 보호조치를 이용하여 저작물을 배포, 전송, 전시, 공연 및 방송하여서는 안 됩니다. 이러한 제한은 편집저작물 또는 데이터베이스에 포함되어 있는 저작물에도 적용되지만, 저작물을 포함하고 있는 편집저작물 또는 데이터베이스가 그 저작물과는 별개로 본 이용허락의 조건에 제한받는 것은 아닙니다. 만약 귀하가 편집저작물을 작성하거나 데이터베이스를 제작하였다면, 이용허락자의 통지가 있는 경우, 귀하는, 실행가능한 한도에서, 이용허락자가 통지에 의하여 요청한 바에 따라서 편집저작물 또는 데이터베이스에서 이용허락자나 원저작자를 나타내는 사항을 삭제하여야 합니다.
귀하가 저작물, 2차적 저작물, 편집저작물, 데이터베이스를 배포, 전송, 전시, 공연 및 방송하는 경우, 귀하는 저작물에 대한 모든 저작권표시를 제거 또는 변경시켜서는 안 되며, 원저작자의 성명(이명이 있는 경우에는 이명), 저작물의 제호, 합리적으로 가능한 한도에서 이용허락자가 저작물과 연관되는 것을 명기한 통일자원식별부호(통일자원식별부호가 저작물에 대한 저작권표시나 이용허락에 관한 정보와 관련되지 않는 경우에는 제외), (2차적 저작물의 경우에는) 2차적 저작물에 저작물을 이용하였다는 것(예컨대, ‘원저작자의 저작물을 한국어로 번역한 것임’ 또는 ‘원저작자의 저작물에 기초한 각본임’) 등을 표시함으로써, 귀하가 이용하는 매체와 수단에 적합하게 원저작자 및 원저작물에 관한 사항을 표시하여야 합니다. 이러한 표시는 합리적인 모든 방법에 의하여 가능하지만, 2차적 저작물, 편집저작물, 데이터베이스의 경우에는, 최소한 다른 저작자가 표시되는 곳에 표시되고 적어도 다른 저작자가 표시되는 만큼 눈에 띄는 방법으로 표시되어야 합니다.
귀하는 저작자의 명예훼손에 해당할 정도로 저작물의 내용, 형식 및 제호의 동일성을 변경하여서는 안 됩니다.
5. 보증의 부인 및 책임의 제한
당사자간에 서면에 의하여 달리 합의되지 않는 한, 이용허락자는 저작물을 있는 그대로 제공하며 일체의 보증이나 담보책임을 부담하지 않습니다.
법이 달리 정하는 경우를 제외하고, 이용허락자는, 본 이용허락이나 저작물의 이용으로부터 야기되는 손해에 대하여 책임을 부담하지 않습니다.
6. 이용허락의 종료
본 이용허락 및 이에 의하여 부여되는 권리는 귀하가 본 이용허락의 조건을 위반하는 경우에 자동적으로 종료됩니다. 그러나 본 이용허락에 의하여 귀하로부터 2차적 저작물, 편집저작물, 데이터베이스를 수령한 개인이나 단체에 대해서는, 본 이용허락을 완전히 준수하는 한, 이용허락이 종료되지 않습니다. 제1조, 제2조, 제5조 내지 제8조는 본 이용허락이 종료한 후에도 유효합니다.
이용허락의 종료에 관한 이러한 제한이 적용되는 것을 제외하고는, 본 이용허락에 의하여 허여되는 허락은 저작물의 존속기간동안 유효합니다. 그러나 이용허락자는 언제든지 본 이용허락과 다른 조건으로 저작물에 대하여 이용허락하거나 저작물의 배포를 중단시킬 수 있는 권리를 가집니다. 단 이용허락자가 이와 같은 권리를 행사하여도 본 이용허락(또는 본 이용허락의 조건에 따라 허여되었거나 허여될 것이 요구되는 기타의 이용허락)이 철회되는 것은 아니며, 본 이용허락은, 본 이용허락의 종료규정에 의하여 종료되지 않는 한, 계속하여 완전히 유효합니다.
7. 기타
귀하가 저작물, 편집저작물, 데이터베이스를 배포 또는 전송하는 경우에는 언제든지, 이용허락자는, 배포 또는 전송받는 자에게, 본 이용허락에 의하여 귀하에게 허여된 이용허락과 동일한 조건에 따라, 저작물에 대한 이용허락을 허여합니다.
귀하가 2차적 저작물을 배포 또는 전송하는 경우에는 언제든지, 이용허락자는, 배포 또는 전송받는 자에게, 본 이용허락에 의하여 귀하에게 허여된 이용허락과 동일한 조건에 따라, 원저작물에 대한 이용허락을 허여합니다.
본 이용허락의 어떠한 규정이 관련법에 의하여 무효이거나 집행할 수 없게 되는 경우, 이에 의하여 본 이용허락에서 무효나 집행할 수 없게 된 조건 외의 다른 조건의 유효성이나 집행가능성이 영향을 받지 않으며, 무효 및 집행할 수 없게 된 규정은, 이용허락 당사자에 의한 별도의 조치 없이, 유효 및 집행 가능한 것으로 하기 위하여 필요한 최소한의 한도에서 개정된 것으로 해석됩니다.
당사자의 서면에 의한 의사표시가 없는 한, 본 이용허락의 조건 또는 규정의 적용을 포기하거나, 위반행위에 대한 권리 주장을 하지 않기로 동의하였다고 간주되지 않습니다.
본 이용허락은 이에 의하여 이용허락된 저작물에 관하여 당사자간에 이루어진 모든 합의를 나타냅니다. 본 이용허락에 명시되지 않은 저작물에 관해서는 아무런 양해나 합의나 설명이 이루어진 것이 아닙니다. 이용허락자는 귀하가 어떠한 추가조항의 적용을 통지하여도 이에 구속받지 않습니다. 본 이용허락은 이용허락자와 귀하 상호간에 서면에 의한 합의에 의하지 않고서는 수정될 수 없습니다.
본 이용허락은 한국어에 의하여 제공되며, 본 이용허락의 영문판은 한국어판을 해석하는 자료가 되는 것에 불과하며 한국어판과 영문판이 일치하지 않는 경우에는 한국어판이 우선합니다.
8. 준거법
본 이용허락은 한국법에 의하여 규율되며 이에 근거하여 해석됩니다.

1. Definities
'Verzamelwerk' een werk waarin het Werk, in zijn geheel en in ongewijzigde vorm, samen met andere werken, die elk een afzonderlijk en zelfstandig werk vormen, tot een geheel is samengevoegd.Voorbeelden van een verzamelwerk zijn een tijdschrift, een bloemlezing of een encyclopedie. Een Verzamelwerk zal voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk (als hieronder omschreven) worden beschouwd.
'Afgeleid werk' een werk dat is gebaseerd op het Werk of op het Werk en andere reeds bestaande werken. Voorbeelden van een Afgeleid werk zijn een vertaling, een muziekschikking (arrangement), een toneelbewerking, een literaire bewerking, een verfilming, een geluidsopname, een kunstreproductie, een verkorte versie, een samenvatting of enig andere bewerking van het Werk, met dien verstande dat een Verzamelwerk voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk zal worden beschouwd. Indien het Werk een muziekwerk betreft, zal de synchronisatie van de tijdslijnen van het Werk en een bewegend beeld ('synching') voor de toepassing van deze Licentie als een Afgeleid Werk worden beschouwd.
'Licentiegever' de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon die het Werk volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie aanbiedt.
'Maker' de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon die het oorspronkelijke werk gemaakt heeft.
'Werk' het auteursrechtelijk beschermde werk dat volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie wordt aangeboden. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder het Werk mede verstaan de geluidsopname in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de databank in de zin van de Databankenwet.
'Gebruiker' de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon die rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uitoefent en die de voorwaarden van deze Licentie met betrekking tot het Werk niet eerder geschonden heeft, of die van de Licentiegever uitdrukkelijke toestemming gekregen heeft om rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uit te oefenen ondanks een eerdere schending.
2. Beperkingen van de uitsluitende rechten. Niets in deze Licentie strekt ertoe om de rechten te beperken die voortvloeien uit de beperkingen en uitputting van de uitsluitende rechten van de rechthebbende krachtens het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het databankenrecht of enige andere toepasselijke rechten.
3. Licentieverlening. Met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie verleent de Licentiegever hierbij aan de Gebruiker een wereldwijde, niet-exclusieve licentie om de navolgende rechten met betrekking tot het Werk vrij van royalty's uit te oefenen voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten:
het reproduceren van het Werk, het opnemen van het Werk in een of meerdere Verzamelwerken, en het reproduceren van het in de Verzamelwerken opgenomen Werk;
het maken en reproduceren van Afgeleide werken;
het verspreiden van exemplaren of geluidsopnames van het Werk, het in het openbaar tonen, op- en uitvoeren en uitvoeren door middel van een digitale geluidsoverdracht van het Werk, afzonderlijk en als deel van een Verzamelwerk;
het verspreiden van exemplaren of geluidsopnames van Afgeleide werken, het in het openbaar te tonen, op- en uitvoeren en uitvoeren door middel van digitale geluidsoverdracht van Afgeleide werken;
het Werk opvragen en hergebruiken;
De Gebruiker mag deze rechten uitoefenen met behulp van alle thans bekende media, dragers en formats. De Gebruiker is tevens gerechtigd om technische wijzigingen aan te brengen die noodzakelijk zijn om de rechten met behulp van andere media, dragers en formats uit te oefenen. Alle niet uitdrukkelijk verleende rechten zijn hierbij voorbehouden aan de Licentiegever.
4. Beperkingen. De in artikel 3 verleende Licentie is uitdrukkelijk gebonden aan de volgende beperkingen:
De Gebruiker mag het Werk uitsluitend verspreiden, in het openbaar tonen, op- of uitvoeren of digitaal uitvoeren met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie, en de Gebruiker dient een exemplaar van, of de Uniform Resource Identifier voor, deze Licentie toe te voegen aan elk exemplaar of elke geluidsopname van het Werk dat de Gebruiker verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert, of digitaal uitvoert. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk onder enige afwijkende voorwaarden aan te bieden waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de uitoefening van de rechten van de ontvangers krachtens deze Licentie worden gewijzigd of beperkt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk in sublicentie te geven. De Gebruiker dient alle vermeldingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie dan wel naar de uitsluiting van garantie te laten staan. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk te verspreiden, in het openbaar te tonen, op of uit te voeren of digitaal uit te voeren met behulp van technologische voorzieningen die de toegang tot of het gebruik van het Werk beperken op een wijze die niet in overeenstemming is met de voorwaarden van deze Licentie-overeenkomst. Het voorgaande is tevens van toepassing op het Werk dat deel uitmaakt van een Verzamelwerk, maar dat houdt niet in dat het Verzamelwerk, afgezien van het Werk zelf, gebonden is aan de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. Indien de Gebruiker een Verzamelwerk maakt, dient deze, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, elke verwijzing naar die Licentiegever of de Maker uit het Verzamelwerk te verwijderen, voor zover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek. Indien de Gebruiker een Afgeleid werk maakt, dient hij, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, elke verwijzing naar die Licentiegever of de Maker uit het Afgeleide werk te verwijderen, voor zover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek.
Indien de Gebruiker het Werk, Afgeleide Werken of Verzamelwerken verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert of digitaal uitvoert, dient de Gebruiker alle auteursrechtvermeldingen met betrekking tot het Werk te laten staan en naar de Maker te verwijzen op een wijze die redelijk is in verhouding tot het gebruikte medium of middel door de naam (of het pseudoniem indien van toepassing) te vermelden van de Maker indien deze wordt vermeld; van de titel van het Werk indien deze wordt vermeld; voorzover redelijkerwijs toepasbaar de Uniform Resource Identifier, indien aanwezig, waarvan de Licentiegever heeft aangegeven dat deze bij het Werk hoort, tenzij de URI niet verwijst naar de auteursrechtvermeldingen of de licentie-informatie betreffende het Werk; in geval van een Afgeleid werk, door te verwijzen naar het gebruik van het Werk in het Afgeleide werk (bijvoorbeeld: 'De Franse vertaling van het Werk van de Maker' of 'Scenario gebaseerd op het Werk van de Maker'). De Gebruiker dient op redelijke wijze aan deze vereisten te voldoen; echter, met dien verstande dat, in geval van een Afgeleid werk of een Verzamelwerk, de naamsvermeldingen in ieder geval geplaatst dienen te worden daar waar andere, soortgelijke aanduidingen van het makerschap zijn geplaatst, en op een wijze die in ieder geval even duidelijk is als andere, soortgelijke aanduidingen van het makerschap.
De in artikel 3 verleende rechten mogen worden uitgeoefend met inachtneming van het niet voor afstand vatbare morele recht van de maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) krachtens artikel 25 lid 1 sub d van de Auteurswet 1912 (en/of artikel 5 lid 1 sub d van de Wet op de naburige rechten) om zich te verzetten tegen elke misvorming, verminking of andere aantasting van het werk, welke nadeel zou kunnen toebrengen aan de eer of de naam van de maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) of aan zijn waarde in deze hoedanigheid.
5. Garantie en vrijwaring. TENZIJ ANDERS SCHRIFTELIJK IS OVEREENGEKOMEN DOOR DE PARTIJEN, STELT DE LICENTIEGEVER HET WERK BESCHIKBAAR OP 'AS-IS' BASIS, ZONDER ENIGE GARANTIE, HETZIJ DIRECT, INDIRECT OF ANDERSZINS, MET BETREKKING TOT HET WERK, MET INBEGRIP VAN, MAAR NIET BEPERKT TOT GARANTIES MET BETREKKING TOT DE EIGENDOMSTITEL, DE VERKOOPBAARHEID, DE GESCHIKTHEID VOOR BEPAALDE DOELEINDEN, MOGELIJKE INBREUK, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN LATENTE OF ANDERE TEKORTKOMINGEN, DE JUISTHEID OF DE AAN- OF AFWEZIGHEID VAN FOUTEN, ONGEACHT DE OPSPOORBAARHEID DAARVAN, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT.
6. Beperking van de aansprakelijkheid. DE LICENTIEGEVER AANVAARDT GEEN ENKELE AANSPRAKELIJKHEID JEGENS DE GEBRUIKER VOOR ENIGE BIJZONDERE OF INCIDENTELE SCHADE OF GEVOLGSCHADE VOORTVLOEIEND UIT DEZE LICENTIE OF HET GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK, ZELFS NIET INDIEN DE LICENTIEGEVER OP DE HOOGTE IS GESTELD VAN HET RISICO VAN DERGELIJKE SCHADE, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT.
7. Beëindiging
Deze Licentie en de daarin verleende rechten vervallen automatisch op het moment dat de Gebruiker in strijd handelt met de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. De licenties van natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die Verzamelwerken hebben ontvangen van de Gebruiker krachtens deze Licentie blijven echter in stand zolang dergelijke natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen zich houden aan de voorwaarden van die licenties. Na de beëindiging van deze Licentie blijven artikelen 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 en 8 onverminderd van kracht.
Met inachtneming van de hierboven vermelde voorwaarden wordt de Licentie verleend voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten op het Werk. De Licentiegever behoudt zich desalniettemin te allen tijde het recht voor om het Werk volgens gewijzigde licentievoorwaarden te verspreiden of om Werk niet langer te verspreiden; met dien verstande dat een dergelijk besluit niet de intrekking van deze Licentie (of enig andere licentie die volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie (verplicht) is verleend) tot gevolg heeft, en deze Licentie onverminderd van kracht blijft tenzij zij op de in lid 1 omschreven wijze wordt beëindigd.
8. Diversen
Elke keer dat de Gebruiker het Werk of een Verzamelwerk verspreidt of in het openbaar op- of uitvoert, biedt de Licentiegever de ontvanger een licentie op het Werk aan volgens de algemene voorwaarden van deze Licentie.
Elke keer dat de Gebruiker een Afgeleid werk verspreidt of in het openbaar digitaal uitvoert, biedt de Licentiegever de ontvanger een licentie op het oorspronkelijke werk aan volgens de algemene voorwaarden van deze Licentie.
Indien enige bepaling van deze Licentie nietig of niet rechtens afdwingbaar is, zullen de overige voorwaarden van deze Licentie volledig van kracht blijven. De nietige of niet-afdwingbare bepaling zal, zonder tussenkomst van de partijen, worden vervangen door een geldige en afdwingbare bepaling waarbij het doel en de strekking van de oorspronkelijke bepaling zoveel mogelijk in acht worden genomen.
Een verklaring van afstand van in deze Licentie verleende rechten of een wijziging van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dient schriftelijk te geschieden en getekend te zijn door de partij die verantwoordelijk is voor de verklaring van afstand respectievelijk de partij wiens toestemming voor de wijziging is vereist.
Deze Licentie bevat de volledige overeenkomst tussen de partijen met betrekking tot het in licentie gegeven Werk. Er zijn geen andere afspraken gemaakt met betrekking tot het Werk. De Licentiegever is niet gebonden aan enige aanvullende bepalingen die worden vermeld in mededelingen van de Gebruiker. Deze licentie kan uitsluitend worden gewijzigd met de wederzijdse, schriftelijke instemming van de Licentiegever en de Gebruiker.
Creative Commons is geen partij bij deze Licentie en stelt geen enkele garantie met betrekking tot het Werk. Creative Commons kan op geen enkele wijze aansprakelijk worden gehouden jegens de Gebruiker of derden voor enigerlei schade met inbegrip van, maar niet beperkt tot enige algemene, bijzondere, incidentele of gevolgschade voortvloeiend uit deze Licentie. Onverminderd het bepaalde in de twee (2) voorgaande volzinnen is Creative Commons gebonden aan alle rechten en verplichtingen van de Licentiegever indien Creative Commons zichzelf uitdrukkelijk kenbaar gemaakt heeft als de Licentiegever krachtens deze Licentie.
Met uitzondering van het beperkte doel om iedereen erop te wijzen dat het Werk in licentie is gegeven krachtens de CCPL, zal geen van de partijen de merknaam 'Creative Commons', enige daarmee verband houdende merknamen dan wel het logo van Creative Commons gebruiken zonder de voorafgaande schriftelijke toestemming van Creative Commons. Het geoorloofde gebruik dient in overeenstemming te zijn met de alsdan geldende richtlijnen betreffende het gebruik van merknamen van Creative Commons zoals die bekend worden gemaakt op de website of anderszins van tijd tot tijd, desgevraagd, ter beschikking worden gesteld.

ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
This Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence enables You (all capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and distribute Works worldwide, provided that You credit the Original Author.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Licence" means this Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence agreement.
"Original Author" means the individual (or entity) who created the Work.
"Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence.
For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number.

You may:
copy the Work;
create one or more Derivative Works;

recognise the Licensor's / Original Author's right of attribution in any Work, Derivative Work and Collective Work that You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate to the public and ensure that You credit the Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media used; and
to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
Additional Provisions for third parties making use of the Work
2.2. Further licence from the Licensor
Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate
the Work; or
any Derivative Work; or
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work
the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use of the Work (in any of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Work on the same terms and conditions as granted to You hereunder.

4. Limit of Liability
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.
5. Termination
The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those Licences.
6. General
6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this agreement is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or unenforceable.
6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.

7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor or user of the Licence.

7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the Licence, and in all events is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from the Licensor's or Your reliance on this Licence or on its enforceability.
7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS THESE CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION'S VERY LIMITED ROLE AS A FACILITATOR OF THE LICENCE FROM THE LICENSOR TO YOU.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE.
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this Licence.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works; including an adaptation of a Work, translation, musical Work, dramatization, fictionalization, cinematographic film, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, adaptation for use by sensory disabled persons, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence . Synching is not limited to synchronization of sound and moving images.
"Entity" includes a legal person or a number of persons acting together, such as a partnership or an unincorporated association and where appropriate the State or an international organisation.
"Licensor" means the individual or Entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or Entity who created the Work, and where Performers Protection is applicable the performer.
"Work" means the original work of authorship and, where appropriate performance, offered under the terms of this Licence, including literary, musical and artistic works; cinematograph films; sound recordings; broadcasts; programme-carrying signals; published editions and computer programs. The performance must be fixed to constitute a work under this Licence.
"You" means an individual or Entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
"Licence Elements" means the following high-level licence attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution.
"Creative Commons" in this Licence refers to both Creative Commons and Creative Commons South Africa.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair dealing, the general exceptions to protection of copyright works or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner or performer under copyright, performer’s protection law or other applicable laws.
3. Licence Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence, for the duration of the applicable copyright to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work;
to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies of, display publicly, perform publicly, and broadcast, the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies of, display publicly, perform publicly, and broadcast Derivative Works;
to transmit the Work, including as incorporated in Collective Works in a diffusion service;
to transmit Derivative Works in a diffusion service;
to publish the Work, including as incorporated in Collective Works;
to publish Derivative Works;
to make the work available to the public.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work or sound recording:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licences. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. SAMRO) royalties for the public performance, broadcasting or diffusion through a diffusion service of the Work.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency (SARRAL, NORM) or designated agent, royalties for any record of a musical work You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to a compulsory Licence created under section 14 of the South African Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
The Licence is irrevocable except for breach as set out in this Licence. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(c).
4. Restrictions. The Licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available the Work only under the terms of this Licence, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish or make available. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and all rights management information. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement or as permitted by law as specified in Section 2. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish or make available the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all rights management information for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means that You are utilizing by:
- conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
- the title of the Work, if supplied, to the extent reasonably practicable;
- the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the rights management information or licensing information for the Work;
- and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that violates the moral rights of the author, to be named as author of the Work, and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where such action is or would be prejudicial to the honour or reputation of the author. Provided that an author who authorizes the use of his work in a cinematograph film or a television broadcast or an author of a computer program or a work associated with a computer program may not prevent or object to modifications that are absolutely necessary on technical grounds. Should an author object compliance with a request to remove the authors’ name from the work in accordance with 4.a above is sufficient to respect the authors’ moral right.

Sujeta a los términos y condiciones precedentes, la Licencia concedida aquí es perpetua (por la duración del derecho de autor aplicable a la Obra).

Creative Commons Corporation ist keine Anwaltskanzlei und bietet keine rechtlichen Auskünfte bzw. Dienstleistungen an. Die Verbreitung dieser Lizenz führt nicht zu einem Mandatsverhältnis des Empfängers mit Creative Commons. Creative Commons übernimmt keine Gewähr für die zur Verfügung gestellten Informationen und lehnt jegliche Haftung für Schäden ab, die aus dem Gebrauch dieser Informationen erwachsen. Dieser Ausschluss von Gewährleistung und Haftung erstreckt sich auch auf die Personen, die an der Adaptierung des vorliegenden Lizenztexts ans schweizerische Recht mitgewirkt haben.
Lizenz  Der „Lizenzgeber“, d.h. die Person, welche den Lizenzgegenstand unter dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung stellt,  und  „Sie“, d.h. die Person, welche aus dieser Lizenz Nutzungsrechte ableitet,  vereinbaren mit dieser Creative Commons Public Licence ("CCPL" oder "Lizenz") die Nutzungsbedingungen für den Lizenzgegenstand,  im Einzelnen:
1.  Definitionen
a.   „Lizenzgegenstand“ kann ein urheberrechtlich geschütztes Werk sein oder eine durch verwandte Schutzrechte geschützte Leistung;
b.   ein „Sammelwerk“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist eine Zusammenstellung des Lizenzgegenstands mit Werken oder sonstigen Elementen. Beim Sammelwerk sind Auswahl und Zusammenstellung als solche selbständig urheberrechtlich geschützt. Ein Sammelwerk gilt nicht als Werk zweiter Hand gemäss Ziff. 1 lit. c dieser Lizenz;
c.   ein „Werk zweiter Hand“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist eine geistige Schöpfung mit individuellem Charakter, die unter Verwendung des Lizenzgegenstands so geschaffen wird, dass der Lizenzgegenstand in seinem individuellen Charakter erkennbar bleibt;
d.    „Urheber“ ist, wer das Werk geschaffen hat;
e.   ein „Werk“ ist eine geistige Schöpfung mit individuellem Charakter;
f.    ein „verwandtes Schutzrecht“ ist ein Recht an einer kulturellen Leistung, welche nicht als Werk geschützt ist, wie etwa jene von ausübenden Künstlern, Herstellern von Ton- und Tonbildträgern oder Sendeunternehmen;
g.   „Lizenzelemente“ sind die folgenden Lizenzcharakteristika: „Namensnennung“, „Weitergabe-unter-gleichen-Bedingungen“, „Keine Bearbeitung“, „Nicht-kommerziell“. Sie werden vom Lizenzgeber ausgewählt und in der Bezeichnung dieser Lizenz soweit anwendbar genannt.
2.   Schranken des Urheberrechts. Dieser Lizenzvertrag lässt sämtliche Befugnisse unberührt, die sich aufgrund der Beschränkungen der ausschliesslichen Rechte des Rechtsinhabers durch das Urheberrechtsgesetz (Eigengebrauch, Erschöpfungsgrundsatz etc.) oder durch andere Bestimmungen der anwendbaren Gesetzgebung ergeben.
3.   Lizenzierung. Unter den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber die Befugnis ein, den Lizenzgegenstand weltweit, lizenzgebührenfrei, nicht exklusiv und zeitlich unbeschränkt (d.h. für die Schutzdauer des Werks oder des verwandten Schutzrechts) wie folgt zu nutzen:
a.   den Lizenzgegenstand zu vervielfältigen, ihn in ein oder mehrere Sammelwerke aufzunehmen und ihn im Rahmen des Sammelwerks zu vervielfältigen;
b.   den Lizenzgegenstand zu bearbeiten oder in anderer Weise umzugestalten;
c.   den Lizenzgegenstand oder Vervielfältigungen davon zu verbreiten, öffentlich wiederzugeben, durch Radio, Fernsehen oder ähnliche Einrichtungen, auch über Leitungen, zu senden, weiterzusenden oder sonstwie wahrnehmbar zu machen, wobei sich diese Befugnisse auch auf den in ein Sammelwerk aufgenommenen Lizenzgegenstand erstrecken;
d.   den bearbeiteten oder umgestalteten Lizenzgegenstand zu vervielfältigen, verbreiten, öffentlich wiederzugeben, durch Radio, Fernsehen oder ähnliche Einrichtungen, auch über Leitungen, zu senden, weiterzusenden oder sonstwie wahrnehmbar zu machen.
Die vorstehend genannten Befugnisse können für alle Nutzungsarten sowie in jedem Medium und Format ausgeübt werden, ob diese bereits bekannt sind oder erst in Zukunft entwickelt werden. Diese Befugnisse umfassen auch das Recht zu Änderungen, die technisch notwendig sind, um die Befugnisse in anderen Medien und Formaten auszuüben.
Diese Lizenz entbindet Sie nicht davon, allfällige nach dem anwendbaren Gesetz oder Nutzungstarif geschuldeten Vergütungen zu bezahlen.
4.   Bedingungen. Die in Ziff. 3 eingeräumten Befugnisse unterliegen den folgenden Bedingungen:
a.   Die Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz muss von einer Kopie dieser Lizenz begleitet sein. Sie können davon absehen, wenn Sie anstatt dessen die jedermann zugängliche Fundstelle dieser Lizenz bekannt geben (Uniform Resource Identifier, URI). Sie müssen alle Hinweise auf diese Lizenz und auf ihre Klauseln betreffend Gewährleistungs- und Haftungsausschluss beibehalten. Sie dürfen keine Vereinbarungen treffen, welche die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verändern oder die mit dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte für einen Dritten einschränken. Sie dürfen für den Lizenzgegenstand keine Unterlizenz erteilen. Sie dürfen den Lizenzgegenstand nicht mit technischen Schutzmassnahmen versehen, die den Gebrauch des Lizenzgegenstands oder den Zugang zu diesem in einer Weise kontrollieren, die mit den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz im Widerspruch stehen.
Das Vorstehende gilt auch, falls der Lizenzgegenstand Bestandteil eines Sammelwerks oder einer Datenbank ist. Dies bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass das Sammelwerk oder die Datenbank als solche diesen Lizenzbestimmungen unterstellt werden müssen.
Wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand in ein Sammelwerk oder eine Datenbank aufnehmen, müssen Sie auf erste Anzeige des Urhebers oder jedes Lizenzgebers hin jeden Hinweis auf den Anzeigenden soweit machbar und gewünscht aus dem Sammelwerk bzw. der Datenbank entfernen; soweit Hinweise gestützt auf eine solche Anzeige zu entfernen sind, entfallen die Pflichten gemäss Ziff. 4 lit. b. Entsprechendes gilt bei Schöpfung eines Werks zweiter Hand.
b.   Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstands oder eines Werks zweiter Hand, sei es isoliert oder als Teil eines Sammelwerks oder einer Datenbank, müssen Sie die bestehenden Copyright-Vermerke vollständig beibehalten bzw. in einem Rahmen wiedergeben, der dem technischen Verfahren und dem Trägermedium der von Ihnen vorgenommenen Nutzung angemessen ist. Insbesondere müssen Sie den Namen (oder das Pseudonym) des Urhebers sowie den Namen von Dritten nennen, die ein Lizenzgeber bzw. ein Urheber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen haben. Ist Ihnen der Titel des Lizenzgegenstands bekannt, müssen Sie diesen angeben. Hat der Lizenzgeber eine Internetadresse angegeben (z.B. in Form des Uniform Resource Identifier, URI), welche Lizenzinformationen oder Copyright-Vermerke enthält, müssen Sie diese ebenfalls nennen, soweit dies mit angemessenem Aufwand durchführbar ist.
Bei Werken zweiter Hand müssen Sie einen Hinweis darauf anführen, in welcher Form der Lizenzgegenstand in die Bearbeitung eingegangen ist (z. B. „Französische Übersetzung des … (Werk) durch … (Urheber)“ oder „Das Drehbuch beruht auf dem Werk des … (Urheber)“). Diese Hinweise können in jeder angemessenen Weise erfolgen. Bei Werken zweiter Hand, Sammelwerken oder Datenbanken müssen solche Hinweise hinsichtlich Platzierung und Ausgestaltung mindestens ebenso auffällig und in vergleichbarer Weise ausgeführt werden, wie dies für die anderen Rechtsinhaber erfolgte.
c.   Obwohl die in Ziff. 3 eingeräumten Befugnisse nach Massgabe dieser Lizenz ausgeübt werden dürfen, findet diese Erlaubnis ihre gesetzliche Grenze in den Persönlichkeitsrechten der Urheber und ausübenden Künstler, deren berechtigte geistige und persönliche Interessen bzw. deren Ansehen oder Ruf durch die Nutzung nicht beeinträchtigt werden dürfen.
5.   Keine Gewährleistung. Sofern vom Lizenzgeber nicht schriftlich anders anerkannt, übernimmt der Lizenzgeber keine Gewährleistung für die erteilten Befugnisse.
6.   Haftungsausschluss. Über die in Ziff. 5 genannte Gewährleistung hinaus haftet der Lizenzgeber nur für Vorsatz und grobe Fahrlässigkeit. Jede andere Haftung ist ausgeschlossen, soweit gesetzlich zulässig. Für seine Hilfspersonen haftet der Lizenzgeber in keinem Fall. Dieser Haftungsausschluss gilt auch dann, wenn Sie auf die Möglichkeit einer Schädigung hingewiesen haben.
7.   Beendigung
a.   Diese Lizenz und die darunter eingeräumten Befugnisse fallen ohne weiteres und mit sofortiger Wirkung dahin, wenn Sie die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verletzen. Die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 und 8 bleiben ungeachtet der Beendigung dieser Lizenz verbindlich.
b.   Die mit dieser Lizenz eingeräumten Befugnisse werden zeitlich uneingeschränkt eingeräumt (freilich höchstens für die Dauer, für welche der Lizenzgegenstand nach dem anwendbaren Recht urheber- bzw. leistungsschutzrechtlich geschützt ist). Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch für einen beliebigen Zeitpunkt das Recht vor, den Lizenzgegenstand unter einer anderen Lizenz weiterzugeben oder die Verbreitung des Lizenzgegenstands ganz zu beenden. Der Lizenzwechsel wird jedoch nicht die Wirkung eines Widerrufs dieser Lizenz haben (oder jeder anderen Lizenzierung, die auf der Grundlage dieser Lizenz erfolgt oder erfolgen muss), vielmehr wird die Lizenz so lange weiter bestehen, als sie nicht nach lit. a vorstehend beendigt wurde.
8.  Verschiedenes
a.   Jedes Mal, wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand oder ein Sammelwerk gestützt auf Ziff. 3 dieser Lizenz nutzen, räumt der Lizenzgeber auch dem Empfänger eines allfälligen Vervielfältigungsstücks eine Lizenz am Lizenzgegenstand selber ein, und zwar zu denselben Bedingungen wie die Ihnen eingeräumte Lizenz.
b.   Jedes Mal, wenn Sie ein Werk zweiter Hand gestützt auf Ziff. 3 dieser Lizenz nutzen, räumt der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eines Vervielfältigungsstücks eine Lizenz am Lizenzgegenstand selber ein, und zwar zu denselben Bedingungen wie die Ihnen eingeräumte Lizenz.
c.   Sollten sich einzelne Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz nach dem anwendbaren Recht als nicht durchsetzbar oder nichtig erweisen, so bleiben die übrigen Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz gültig und durchsetzbar und an die Stelle der unwirksamen Bestimmung tritt eine Ersatzregelung, die dem mit der unwirksamen Bestimmung angestrebten Zweck am nächsten kommt.
d.   Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz gilt als wegbedungen und keine Verletzung als genehmigt, bevor nicht die durch die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung belastete Partei die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung in Schriftform und unterschriftlich bestätigt hat.
e.   Diese Lizenz enthält alle mit Blick auf den Lizenzgegenstand zwischen den Parteien massgeblichen Bestimmungen. Andere Vertrauenspositionen, Abreden oder Zusicherungen im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand bestehen nicht. Der Lizenzgeber ist durch keine zusätzliche Klausel gebunden, welche sich aus irgendwelchen Unterlagen von Ihnen ergibt. Diese Vereinbarung kann ohne vorherige Vereinbarung mit unterschriftlicher Bestätigung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen nicht abgeändert werden.
f.    Auf diesen Lizenzvertrag findet ausschliesslich schweizerisches Recht Anwendung.
 
Creative Commons ist nicht Partei dieses Lizenzvertrags und macht keinerlei Zusicherungen mit Blick auf den Lizenzgegenstand. Creative Commons haftet nicht für Ihnen entstandene Schäden aus der Verwendung des Lizenzgegenstands oder dieser Lizenz, aus welchem Rechtsgrund sie auch abgeleitet werden, sei es für direkten, indirekten Schaden oder für Folgeschaden. Ungeachtet des vorstehenden Satzes hat Creative Commons alle Rechte aus dieser Lizenz, sofern sie bezüglich eines Werks ausdrücklich selber als Lizenzgeberin unter dieser Lizenz auftritt.

DÍLO JE CHRÁNĚNO PLATNÝMI PŘEDPISY UPRAVUJÍCÍMI PRÁVO AUTORSKÉ. JAKÉKOLI UŽITÍ DÍLA, KTERÉ NENÍ V SOULADU S TĚMITO PŘEDPISY NEBO S TÍMTO LICENČNÍM UJEDNÁNÍM, JE ZAKÁZÁNO.
UŽITÍM DÍLA V SOULADU S TÍMTO LICENČNÍM UJEDNÁNÍM SE NABYVATEL ZAVAZUJE DODRŽOVAT PODMÍNKY TOHOTO UJEDNÁNÍ A STÁVÁ SE JAKO NABYVATEL STRANOU LICENČNÍ SMLOUVY V ROZSAHU, V JAKÉM PODMÍNKY TOHOTO UJEDNÁNÍ NABYVATELE SMLUVNĚ ZAVAZUJÍ. POSKYTOVATEL POSKYTUJE NABYVATELI LICENCI K DÍLU JEN POKUD NABYVATEL BEZPODMÍNEČNĚ AKCEPTUJE PODMÍNKY TOHOTO UJEDNÁNÍ.
1. Definice
Pojem „dílo“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání autorské dílo nebo jiný nehmotný statek chráněný autorským zákonem, pokud příslušný právní řád jeho ochranu též uznává. Autorskými díly mohou být mimo jiné díla literární, výtvarná, hudební, audiovizuální, vědecká, fotografie nebo počítačové programy. Jinými nehmotnými statky jsou zejména umělecké výkony výkonných umělců, zvukové nebo zvukově obrazové záznamy, televizní a rozhlasové vysílání. Za díla jsou považovány též databáze. Pojem „Dílo“ popřípadě „DÍLO“ označuje konkrétní dílo, ke kterému poskytovatel poskytuje nabyvateli licenci za podmínek uvedených v tomto ujednání.
Pojem „souborné dílo“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání soubor nezávislých děl nebo jiných prvků, který je jako celek dílem, a do něhož je celé Dílo v nezměněné, tj. neupravené podobě zařazeno. Souborným dílem může být zejména časopis nebo jiné periodikum, sborník, encyklopedie, antologie, pásmo nebo výstava. Zařazení Díla do souborného díla se nepovažuje za jeho úpravu. Pokud je to výslovně uvedeno, považuje se za souborné dílo též soubor, který místo Díla obsahuje upravené Dílo.
Pojem „upravené Dílo“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání výsledek jakékoliv úpravy Díla, kterou může být zejména zpracování Díla nebo zpracování Díla s jinými díly, doplnění Díla nebo jiné změny Díla. Upraveným Dílem může být mimo jiné jeho překlad, dramatizace, zhudebnění. Za upravené Dílo se považuje i jeho spojení s dalším dílem či prvky (např. užití hudebního díla jako doprovodu), ale ne jeho pouhé zařazení do souborného díla.
Pojem „autor“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání osobu nebo osoby, které Dílo vytvořily.
Pojem „poskytovatel“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání autora nebo jinou fyzickou nebo právnickou osobu, která je oprávněna poskytnout licenci k užití Díla za podmínek uvedených v tomto ujednání.
Pojem „nabyvatel“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání fyzickou nebo právnickou osobu, která užívá Dílo v souladu s tímto ujednáním a která neporušila ve vztahu k Dílu podmínky tohoto ujednání, ledaže získala od poskytovatele výslovný souhlas vykonávat práva k Dílu na základě tohoto ujednání i přes předchozí porušení jeho podmínek.
Pojem „rozmnožování“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání zhotovování rozmnoženin díla, a to jakýmikoli prostředky. Rozmnoženiny mohou být mimo jiné tiskové, fotografické, zvukové, obrazové, nebo zvukově-obrazové a mohou mít též elektronickou podobu, zahrnující vyjádření analogové i digitální. Rozmnožováním je též zhotovení rozmnoženiny nezbytné k zavedení, uložení, zobrazení, provoz a přenos počítačového programu a vytěžování obsahu databáze.
Pojem „rozšiřování“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání zpřístupňování originálu díla nebo jeho rozmnoženiny v hmotné podobě prodejem nebo jiným převodem vlastnického práva. Za rozšiřování díla se považuje také jeho vystavování, pronájem a půjčování.
Pojem „sdělování veřejnosti“ označuje pro účely tohoto ujednání zpřístupňování díla v nehmotné podobě. Sdělováním veřejnosti se mimo jiné rozumí veřejné provozování díla nebo jeho přenos, vysílání rozhlasem nebo televizí a zpřístupňování díla veřejnosti prostřednictvím počítačové nebo jiné sítě, a to způsobem, že kdokoli může mít k němu přístup na místě a v čase podle své volby. Sdělováním veřejnosti je též zužitkování obsahu databáze.
2. Výjimky a omezení ochrany práv k Dílu
Toto ujednání neomezuje, nezužuje ani jinak nelimituje volná užití Díla, užití Díla na základě zákonné licence, vyčerpání práv při prvním převodu vlastnictví k originálu nebo rozmnoženině Díla v hmotné podobě nebo jiná zákonná omezení práv k Dílu.
3. Poskytnutí licence.
Za podmínek stanovených tímto ujednáním poskytuje poskytovatel nabyvateli bezúplatnou, množstevně a místně neomezenou, nevýhradní a časově neomezenou (na celou dobu trvání práv k Dílu) licenci k Dílu:
oprávnění rozmnožovat Dílo, zahrnovat Dílo do souborných děl a jako součást souborných děl Dílo dále rozmnožovat,
oprávnění upravovat Dílo a upravené Dílo rozmnožovat, zařazovat do souborných děl a jako součást souborných děl dále rozmnožovat, pokud je z upraveného Díla nebo jeho označení zřejmé, že Dílo bylo změněno nebo jinak upraveno,
oprávnění Dílo samostatně nebo jako součást souborného díla rozšiřovat a sdělovat veřejnosti,
oprávnění rozšiřovat a sdělovat veřejnosti upravené Dílo.
Práva na odměnu za užití Díla podle tohoto ujednání jsou upravena následovně:
Tímto ujednáním nejsou dotčena práva na odměnu za užití Díla, která poskytovatel nemůže neuplatnit nebo se jich vzdát, zejména práva povinně kolektivně spravovaná.
Ve všech ostatních případech se poskytovatel zavazuje svá práva na odměnu za užití Díla podle tohoto ujednání neuplatnit nebo se jich tímto vzdává.
Nabyvatel je oprávněn Dílo užívat výše uvedenými způsoby na všech nosičích a ve všech formátech, není-li takové užití omezeno zákonem. Oprávnění nabyvatele se vztahuje i na provádění technických úprav nezbytných k tomu, aby Dílo bylo dovoleným způsobem užito na jiném nosiči nebo v jiném formátu. Veškerá práva k Dílu, která nejsou výslovně poskytnuta touto licencí, zůstávají vyhrazena. Nabyvatel není povinen poskytnutou licenci využít.
Je-li součástí poskytované licence i zvláštní právo pořizovatele k jím pořízené databázi, poskytovatel se takového práva k Dílu v celém rozsahu vzdává.
4. Omezení licence
Nabyvatel je oprávněn rozšiřovat Dílo nebo ho sdělovat veřejnosti pouze za podmínek stanovených tímto ujednáním. Nabyvatel je při tom vždy povinen k Dílu připojit text tohoto ujednání nebo odkaz na něj ve formátu Uniform Resource Identifier (dále jen „URI“). Nabyvatel není oprávněn omezovat užití Díla nad rámec stanovený tímto ujednáním. Nabyvatel není oprávněn poskytovat podlicenci k Dílu. Při rozšiřování Díla nebo jeho sdělování veřejnosti je nabyvatel povinen zachovat beze změny všechny odkazy na toto ujednání a případná ustanovení o odpovědnosti vztahující se k Dílu. Při rozšiřování Díla nebo jeho sdělování veřejnosti nesmí nabyvatel použít žádné technické prostředky ochrany, které by omezovaly oprávnění dalších osob v užití Díla v souladu s tímto ujednáním. Ustanovení tohoto čl. 4 písm. a) se vztahují na Dílo i tehdy, je-li zahrnuto do souborného díla. Licence poskytovaná podle tohoto ujednání se však nemusí vztahovat na souborné dílo jako celek nebo na jeho ostatní části. Pokud nabyvatel vytvoří souborné dílo je povinen na žádost poskytovatele odstranit ze souborného díla údaje uvedené v ustanovení čl. 4 písm. b), je-li to fakticky možné. Pokud nabyvatel vytvoří upravené Dílo je povinen na žádost poskytovatele odstranit z upraveného Díla údaje uvedené v ustanovení čl. 4 písm. b), je-li to fakticky možné.
Při rozšiřování Díla, upraveného Díla nebo souborného díla nebo při jejich sdělování veřejnosti je nabyvatel povinen, pokud nebyl v souladu s ustanovením čl. 4 písm. a) požádán o opak, připojit beze změny všechny copyrightové doložky a je povinen způsobem odpovídajícím danému nosiči a v přiměřené formě uvést následující údaje, pokud existují a jsou mu známy:
jméno případně pseudonym autora nebo jména či označení jiných osob, které autor nebo poskytovatel uvedl v copyrightové doložce k Dílu, v podmínkách užití Díla nebo které označil jiným přiměřeným způsobem (dále jen „uvedené osoby“), pozdější verze tohoto licenčního ujednání se shodnými licenčními prvky,
název Díla,
odkaz ve formátu URI, který poskytovatel k Dílu připojil, pokud odkazuje na copyrightovou doložku k Dílu nebo na licenční podmínky a
pokud se jedná o upravené Dílo, též údaje o Díle a o způsobu, kterým bylo upraveno, v souladu s ustanovením čl. 3 písm. b).
Údaje uvedené v ustanovení tohoto čl. 4 písm. b) má nabyvatel povinnost uvést jakýmkoli přiměřeným způsobem. V případě upraveného Díla nebo souborného díla se považuje za přiměřené, aby údaje vztahující se k Dílu byly uvedeny spolu s obdobnými údaji o ostatních dílech, která byla zahrnuta do souborného díla nebo využita při vzniku upraveného Díla, a to způsobem nesnižujícím jejich hodnotu ve srovnání s obdobnými údaji o ostatních uvedených dílech a ostatních uvedených osobách. Údaje uvedené v ustanovení tohoto čl. 4 písm. b) je nabyvatel oprávněn použít pouze pro označení Díla v souvislosti s užitím Díla v souladu s tímto ujednáním. Bez předchozího písemného souhlasu uvedených osob není nabyvatel oprávněn uvádět údaje o Díle způsobem, který by přímo či nepřímo vyvolal dojem účasti nebo jiné formy podpory ze strany uvedených osob.
Omezení uvedená v čl. 4 písm. a) a b) se nevztahují na ty části Díla, na které se vztahuje definice díla uvedená v čl. 1 písm. a) pouze z důvodu ochrany zvláštních práv pořizovatele databáze.
Tímto ujednáním nejsou dotčena osobnostní práva autora, pokud příslušný právní řád jejich ochranu uznává. Zejména si nikdo nesmí osobovat autorství k Dílu a Dílo smí být užito jen způsobem nesnižujícím jeho hodnotu. Za zásah do osobnostních práv autora se nepovažuje jednání v souladu s podmínkami stanovenými tímto ujednáním.
5. Odpovědnost za vady
NEBYLA-LI MEZI POSKYTOVATELEM A NABYVATELEM UZAVŘENA PÍSEMNÁ DOHODA UPRAVUJÍCÍ ODPOVĚDNOST POSKYTOVATELE ZA VADY DÍLA, POSKYTUJE POSKYTOVATEL DÍLO TAKOVÉ, JAKÉ JE. POSKYTOVATEL NEPROHLAŠUJE, ŽE DÍLO MÁ URČITÉ VLASTNOSTI A NEPOSKYTUJE K DÍLU ZÁRUKY, COŽ NABYVATEL BERE NA VĚDOMÍ.
6. Odpovědnost za škodu
POSKYTOVATEL NEODPOVÍDÁ ZA ŽÁDNOU ŠKODU NAD MINIMÁLNÍ ROZSAH STANOVENÝ PLATNOU PRÁVNÍ ÚPRAVOU, COŽ NABYVATEL BERE NA VĚDOMÍ.
7. Ukončení licence
Nabyvateli zaniká licence k Dílu podle tohoto ujednání okamžikem, kdy nabyvatel poruší podmínky tohoto ujednání. Tím nejsou dotčeny licence k upravenému Dílu nebo soubornému dílu, které nabyvatel poskytl nebo poskytne v souladu s tímto ujednáním dalším osobám, pokud tyto osoby podmínky příslušné licence dodržují. Články 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 a 8 tohoto ujednání zůstávají v účinnosti i po zániku oprávnění k užití Díla podle tohoto odstavce.
Nedojde-li k zániku licence k Dílu podle odstavce a), je licence k Dílu časově neomezená (na celou dobu trvání práv k Dílu). Poskytovatel je oprávněn současně poskytovat k Dílu jiné licence nebo může přestat Dílo šířit, pokud tím nebude dotčena licence k Dílu poskytnutá nabyvateli ani další licence poskytnuté v souladu s tímto ujednáním, a pokud zůstane, vyjma případu uvedeného v předchozím odstavci, v plném rozsahu platná a účinná licence, kterou poskytovatel nabyvateli na základě tohoto ujednání poskytl.
8. Závěrečná ustanovení
Když nabyvatel rozšiřuje nebo sděluje veřejnosti Dílo nebo souborné dílo, poskytuje licenci k Dílu dalším osobám přímo poskytovatel, a to za stejných podmínek a ve stejném rozsahu, v jakém získal licenci k Dílu nabyvatel na základě tohoto ujednání.

Licens
Værket (som det defineres nedenfor) tilbydes på de betingelser, som følger af denne Creative Commons Public Licens ("CCPL" eller "Licensen"). Værket er beskyttet af ophavsretten og/eller anden gældende ret. Enhver brug af Værket udover den, der følger af Licensen eller af ophavsretten i øvrigt, er ikke tilladt.
Ved at udøve den ret Licensen giver til Værket, accepterer du at være bundet af samtlige vilkår som er angivet nedenfor i denne licens.
1. Definitioner
"Samleværk" betyder et værk, såsom en periodisk udgivelse, en antologi eller et opslagsværk, i hvilket Værket i uændret form, sammen med et antal andre bidrag, der i sig selv udgør enkeltstående og uafhængige værker, bliver samlet til en helhed. Et værk, der udgør et Samleværk, vil ikke ifølge vilkårene i Licensen blive betragtet som et Bearbejdet Værk (som dette begreb er defineret nedenfor).
"Bearbejdet Værk" (en bearbejdelse) betyder et værk, der er baseret på Værket eller på Værket og andre ældre værker, såsom en oversættelse, et musikalsk arrangement, en dramatisering, 'fiktionalisering', filmversionering, lydoptagelse, billedgengivelse, forkortelse, sammenfatning eller en hvilken som helst anden form til hvilken Værket kan blive konverteret, ændret eller tilpasset, med undtagelse af et Samleværk der ifølge vilkårene i Licensen ikke skal betragtes som et Bearbejdet Værk. I tilfælde af, at Værket er et musikværk eller en lydoptagelse, skal synkroniseringen med et filmværk betragtes som et Bearbejdet Værk ifølge Licensen.
"Licensgiver" betyder den fysiske eller juridiske person, som tilbyder benyttelse af Værket på de vilkår, som følger af Licensen.
"Originær Rettighedshaver" betyder den fysiske eller juridiske person, som har skabt Værket.
"Værk" betyder den frembringelse eller den præstation, der er beskyttet af egentlige ophavsrettigheder eller af ophavsretsbeslægtede rettigheder, og som tilbydes på de vilkår der følger af denne Licens.
"Du"/"Dig" betyder en fysisk eller juridisk person, der udøver rettigheder i henhold til Licensen, og som ikke tidligere har misligholdt vilkårene i Licensen i forhold til Værket, eller som har fået en udtrykkelig tilladelse fra Licensgiveren til at udøve rettigheder ifølge Licensen på trods af en tidligere misligholdelse af vilkårene i Licensen.
2. Indskrænkninger
Licensen har ikke til formål på nogen måde at begrænse retten til eksemplarfremstilling til privat brug, citatretten eller andre indskrænkninger i rettighedshaverens eksklusive rettigheder i henhold til ophavsretsloven eller i henhold til anden gældende ret.
3. Licensaftalen
I overensstemmelse med vilkårene i Licensen erhverver Du fra licensgiver en global, royalty-fri, ikke-eksklusiv, tidsubegrænset (i Værkets beskyttelsesperiode) ret til at udnytte Værket på følgende måde:
at fremstille eksemplarer af Værket, at indarbejde Værket i et eller flere Samleværker og at fremstille eksemplarer af Værket i det omfang, det er indarbejdet i Samleværket;
at skabe og fremstille eksemplarer af bearbejdelser af Værket;
at sprede eksemplarer af Værket til almenheden, vise Værket offentligt, fremføre Værket offentligt, herunder overføre Værket til almenheden, inklusive Værket som det indgår i Samleværket;
at sprede eksemplarer af det Bearbejdede Værk til almenheden, vise det Bearbejdede Værk offentligt, fremføre det Bearbejdede Værk offentligt, herunder overføre det Bearbejdede Værk til almenheden;
Royalties for kommerciel udnyttelse:
Royalties for kommerciel offentlig fremførelse. Licensgiver fraskriver sig eneretten til individuelt eller gennem en rettighedshaverorganisation (som fx KODA, Gramex og Copydan) at opkræve royalties for offentlig fremførelse, herunder offentlig digital fremførelse (fx webcast), af Værket.
Mekaniske rettigheder og eksemplarfremstillingsrettigheder . Licensgiver fraskriver sig eneretten til individuelt eller gennem en rettighedshaverorganisation (som fx NCB og Copydan) at opkræve royalties for enhver indspilning og eksemplarfremstilling af Værket
Webcasting rettigheder. Webcasting er offentlig fremførelse og er således omfattet af bestemmelserne ovenfor under (e)(i).
Ovenstående rettigheder må udøves i alle eksisterende og fremtidige medier og formater. Ovenstående rettigheder inkluderer retten til at udføre sådanne ændringer, som er teknisk nødvendige for at kunne udøve rettighederne på andre medier og formater. De rettigheder, der ikke udtrykkeligt er nævnt ovenfor, forbliver hos Licensgiver.
4. Begrænsninger
Den meddelte licens efter punkt 3 ovenfor er undergivet og begrænset af følgende indskrænkninger:
Du må alene sprede Værket til almenheden, vise Værket offentligt, fremføre Værket offentligt herunder overføre Værket trådbunden eller trådløs til almenheden under iagttagelse af vilkårene i Licensen, og hver gang Du spreder Værket til almenheden, viser Værket offentligt, fremfører Værket offentligt herunder overfører Værket trådbunden eller trådløs til almenheden, skal det ledsages af en kopi af Licensen eller Uniform Ressource Identifier for Licensen. Du må ikke tilbyde eller påbyde betingelser for Værket, som ændrer eller indskrænker Licensens vilkår eller modtagernes udøvelse af deres rettigheder efter Licensen. Du må ikke give underlicenser til Værket. Du skal sikre, at alle meddelelser, som henviser til Licensen og til ansvarsfraskrivelsen, videregives i uændret form. Du må ikke sprede Værket til almenheden, vise Værket offentligt, fremføre Værket offentligt herunder overføre Værket trådbunden eller trådløs til almenheden under anvendelse af nogen form for tekniske foranstaltninger, som begrænser adgangen til eller brugen af Værket på en måde, som er i strid med vilkårene i Licensen. Ovennævnte finder tilsvarende anvendelse på Værket, som udgør en del af et Samleværk, men det er ikke et krav, at Samleværket bortset fra Værket som sådan skal være undergivet vilkårene i Licensen. Hvis Du skaber et Samleværk, skal Du, efter at have modtaget påkrav herom fra en hvilken som helst Licensgiver, i den udstrækning det er praktisk muligt, slette enhver kreditering som krævet ifølge punkt 4(b) fra Samleværket. Hvis Du skaber et Bearbejdet Værk, skal Du, efter at have modtaget påkrav herom fra en hvilken som helst Licensgiver, i den udstrækning det er praktisk muligt, slette enhver kreditering som krævet ifølge punkt 4(b) fra det Bearbejdede Værk.
Såfremt du spreder Værket, Samleværket eller det Bearbejdede værk til almenheden, viser Værket, Samleværket eller det Bearbejdede værk offentligt, fremfører Værket, Samleværket eller det Bearbejdede værk offentligt herunder overfører Værket, Samleværket eller det Bearbejdede værk til almenheden, skal Du sikre, at Copyright Notices (copyright mærkning), videregives intakt, samt kreditering i overensstemmelse med god skik under hensyn til det medium og de midler, Du anvender: (i) ved angivelse af navnet (eller i påkommende tilfælde pseudonymet) på den Originære Rettighedshaver, hvis det er tilvejebragt, og/eller (ii) hvis den Originære Rettighedshaver og/eller Licensgiver har aftalt, at en eller flere andre parter (f.eks. en bevillingsgiver, en sponsorinstitution, en forlagsenhed, et tidsskrift) skal navngives i forbindelse med licensgivers Copyright Notice, ved angivelse af karakteren af den ydelse, en sådan part måtte have ydet, eller ved andre rimelige midler navnet på en sådan part eller sådanne parter; Værkets titel, hvis det er tilvejebragt; i den udstrækning det er praktisk muligt, Uniform Resource Identifier, hvis der findes en sådan, som Licensgiver har angivet at være knyttet til Værket, medmindre en sådan URI ikke henviser til Copyright Notice eller information om Licensen; og ved et Bearbejdet Værk en angivelse, der karakteriserer brugen af Værket i det Bearbejdede Værk (som f.eks. "Fransk oversættelse af den Originære Rettighedshavers Værk," eller "Filmmanuskript baseret på den Originære Rettighedshavers Værk." En sådan angivelse skal foretages i overensstemmelse med god skik. Ved et Bearbejdet Værk og et Samleværk skal en sådan angivelse dog i det mindste foretages der, hvor tilsvarende kreditering finder sted, og på en sådan måde som i det mindste er lige så fremtrædende som krediteringen af lignende rettighedshavere.
5. Ansvarsfraskrivelse I
Med mindre andet skriftligt er aftalt mellem parterne, tilbyder Licensgiver Værket,"som det er og forefindes" uden indeståelse af nogen art vedrørende Værket. Dette gælder både udtrykkelig indeståelse, samt indeståelse, som licenstager måtte forudsætte, og omfatter uden begrænsninger indeståelse vedrørende rettighedssubjekter, Værkets kommercielle egenskaber og andre egenskaber ved selve Værket, ikke-krænkelse samt Værkets anvendelighed i relation til et bestemt formål. I visse jurisdiktioner tillades ikke begrænsninger på en indeståelse, der er forudsat af en medkontrahent, så denne begrænsning gælder muligvis ikke for Dig.
6. Ansvarsfraskrivelse II
Med undtagelse af hvad der følger af gældende ret, fraskriver Licensgiver sig ethvert ansvar over for Dig i relation til licensen og brug af værket for så vidt angår alle former for skade herunder direkte og indirekte skade, selv hvis Licensgiver har fået meddelelse om, at en sådan skade ville kunne opstå.
7. Licensens ophør
Licensen samt de rettigheder, der er indrømmet herved, ophører straks ved enhver misligholdelse fra Din side af vilkår indeholdt i Licensen. Fysiske eller juridiske personer, som har modtaget Bearbejdede Værker eller Samleværker, som defineret under punkt 1, fra Dig i medfør af Licensen vil imidlertid ikke få deres licenser bragt til ophør, såfremt disse fysiske eller juridiske personer til fulde respekterer disse licenser. Uanset ophøret af Licensen opretholdes gyldigheden af bestemmelserne under punkterne 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 og 8.
I overensstemmelse med ovenstående vilkår er den her tildelte licens tidsubegrænset (i Værkets beskyttelsesperiode). Uanset det ovenfor anførte forbeholder Licensgiver sig retten til at tilgængeliggøre Værket under andre, alternative vilkår samt at ophøre med tilgængeliggørelsen af Værket på ethvert tidspunkt, såfremt en sådan handling ikke har til formål at trække Licensen tilbage (eller enhver anden licens, som er afgivet i medfør af eller er betinget af vilkårene i Licensen), og Licensen vil forblive fuldt gyldig, medmindre den er bragt til ophør som anført ovenfor.
8. Øvrige bestemmelser
Hver gang Du tilgængeliggører Værket eller et Samleværk for almenheden, herunder ved trådbunden eller trådløs overføring til almenheden, tilbyder Licensgiver modtageren en licens til Værket på de samme vilkår, som gælder i forhold til Dig ifølge Licensen.
Hver gang Du tilgængeliggør et Bearbejdet Værk for almenheden, herunder ved trådbunden eller trådløs overføring til almenheden, tilbyder Licensgiver modtageren en licens til det oprindelige Værk på de samme vilkår, som gælder i forhold til Dig ifølge Licensen.
Hvis dele af Licensen er ugyldige i medfør af gældende ret, skal dette ikke påvirke gyldigheden af de øvrige dele af Licensen, og aftalen skal uden videre fortolkes således, at de ugyldige dele tilpasses med det minimum af ændringer, der skal til for at gøre delene gyldige i bedst mulige overensstemmelse med aftalens formål og målsætninger.
En part skal ikke anses for at have afstået fra at gøre vilkårene i Licensen gældende, eller givet tilladelse til en overtrædelse heraf, medmindre et skriftligt tilsagn er underskrevet af den part, som foretager en sådan afståelse eller giver en sådan tilladelse.
Licensen udgør den fuldstændige aftale mellem parterne vedrørende det licenserede Værk. Der er ingen underforståede aftalevilkår eller tilkendegivelser vedrørende værket, som ikke er angivet her. Licensgiver er ikke bundet af yderligere vilkår, som måtte være tilkendegivet af Dig. Licensen kan ikke ændres uden gensidig, skriftlig aftale mellem Licensgiver og Dig.

AZ ALÁBBIAKBAN MEGHATÁROZOTT MŰVET A CREATIVE COMMONS LICENC NYILVÁNOS FELTÉTELEI („CCPL” VAGY „LICENC”) ALAPJÁN BOCSÁTJÁK RENDELKEZÉSRE. A MŰVET A SZERZŐI JOG, ILLETVE EGYÉB VONATKOZÓ JOGSZABÁLY VÉDI. A MŰNEK BÁRMINEMŰ, A JELEN LICENCBEN FOGLALTAKTÓL, ILLETVE A SZERZŐI JOGBAN MEGHATÁROZOTTAKTÓL ELTÉRŐ FELHASZNÁLÁSA TILOS.
AZ E LICENCEN ALAPULÓ, A MŰRE VONATKOZÓ FELHASZNÁLÁSI JOG GYAKORLÁSÁVAL A FELHASZNÁLÓ A JELEN LICENCBEN FOGLALTAKAT MAGÁRA NÉZVE KÖTELEZŐNEK ISMERI EL. A JOGOSULT AZ ITT MEGHATÁROZOTT JOGOKAT CSAK EZEN FELTÉTELEK ELFOGADÁSA MELLETT BIZTOSÍTJA A FELHASZNÁLÓNAK.
1. Definíciók
„Kollektív Mű” az a Mű – pl. időszaki kiadvány, antológia vagy enciklopédia – amelyben a Mű teljes egészében, változatlan formában jelenik meg, és több más kiegészítéssel –, amelyek önmagukban is önálló és független műnek tekintendőek – kollektív egészet alkot. Jelen Licenc alkalmazásában a Kollektív Mű fogalmának megfelelő Mű nem tekinthető az alábbiakban meghatározott Származékos Műnek.
„Származékos Mű” az a Mű, amely a Művön vagy a Művön és más már létező műveken alapul – így pl. fordításon, zenei feldolgozáson, színpadra alkalmazáson, regényként való feldolgozáson, megfilmesítésen, hangfelvételen, művészi reprodukción, rövidítésen, tömörítésen –, vagy bármi más olyan formán, amelyben a Mű átalakítva, átdolgozva, adaptálva megjelenik, azzal a kikötéssel, hogy jelen Licenc értelmében a Kollektív Műnek minősülő Mű nem tekintendő Származékos Műnek. Kétség esetén ha a Mű zenemű vagy hangfelvétel, a mozgóképként megjelenő, a Művel időben összekapcsolódó szinkronizálás jelen Licenc értelmében Származékos Műnek tekintendő.
„Jogosult” az a magánszemély vagy jogi személy, jogi személyiséggel nem rendelkező gazdasági társaság, aki/amely a Művet jelen Licenc feltételei mellett közzéteszi.
„Eredeti Szerző” a Művet megalkotó természetes személy.
„Mű” a szerzői jogvédelem alatt álló alkotás, amelyet a jelen Licenc feltételei mellett tesznek hozzáférhetővé.
„Felhasználó” a jelen Licenc feltételeinek megfelelően jogot gyakorló természetes személy vagy jogi személy vagy jogi személyiséggel nem rendelkező gazdasági társaság, aki/amely a jelen Licenc feltételeit a Mű vonatkozásában korábban nem sértette meg, vagy aki a Licenc jogosultjától kifejezett engedélyt kapott arra, hogy a korábbi jogsértés ellenére a Licencből eredő jogokat gyakorolja.
2. A szerző jogainak korlátai Jelen Licenc a Jogosultnak és az Eredeti Szerzőnek a szerzői jog és más alkalmazandó jog alapján fennálló kizárólagos jogai alóli kivételeket és korlátozásokat, valamint az egyéb megszorításokat (például a jogkimerülést) nem érinti.
3. A felhasználási jogok biztosítása Jelen Licenc feltételei értelmében a Jogosult ezennel a Felhasználónak az egész világra kiterjedő, díjmentes, nem kizárólagos, folyamatos (az alkalmazandó szerzői jog szerinti védelmi idő teljes tartamára) felhasználási jogot biztosít az alábbiak szerint:
a Mű többszörözése, a Mű beillesztése egy vagy több Kollektív Műbe, és a Kollektív Műben foglalt Műnek a többszörözése;
Származékos Mű alkotása és többszörözése;
a Mű példányainak – beleértve a Kollektív Műben foglalt példányokat – vagy hangfelvételének terjesztése, nyilvános bemutatása, nyilvános előadása, nyilvános előadása digitális audio továbbítással;
a Származékos Mű példányainak vagy hangfelvételének terjesztése, nyilvános bemutatása, nyilvános előadása, nyilvános előadása digitális audio továbbítással;
A félreértések elkerülése végett, amennyiben a Mű zenemű vagy audiovizuális alkotás:
Átalányszerződés hatálya alá tartozó előadásért járó díj. A Licenc jogosultja fenntartja magának a jogot arra, hogy a nyilvános előadásért vagy nyilvános digitális előadásért (pl. webcast) jogdíjat szedjen, akár egyénileg, akár egy díjat beszedő társaságon (pl. ASCAP, BMI, SISAC, Artisjus) keresztül.
Mechanikai jogdíjak és törvényi díjigények. A Licenc jogosultja fenntartja magának a jogot arra, hogy akár egyénileg, akár zenei jogi ügynökségen vagy kijelölt ügynökön (pl. Harry Fox Agency, Artisjus) keresztül jogdíjat szedjen be minden olyan hangfelvétel után, amelyet a Fél a Műről létrehoz („cover version”) és terjeszt, az alkalmazandó kényszerengedély értelmében.
Webcasting jogok és törvényi díjigények. A félreértések elkerülése végett: amennyiben a Mű hangfelvétel, a Licenc jogosultja fenntartja magának a kizárólagos jogot arra, hogy akár egyénileg, akár zenei jogi ügynökségen (pl. Soundexhange) vagy kijelölt ügynökön keresztül jogdíjat szedjen be a Mű nyilvános digitális előadása után (értsd: webcast), amely az alkalmazandó kényszerengedély tárgya.
A fenti jogok gyakorolhatók bármely hordozón és minden formában. A fenti jogok magukba foglalják a jogok más hordozón vagy formában történő gyakorlásához technikailag szükséges módosítások elvégzésének jogát. A Jogosult korlátozás nélkül fenntart minden általa kifejezetten át nem engedett jogot.
4. Korlátozások A fenti, 3. bekezdésben biztosított Licenc kifejezetten a következő korlátozások hatálya alá esik:
a Mű csak a jelen Licenc feltételeinek megfelelően terjeszthető, mutatható be nyilvánosan, adható elő nyilvánosan vagy adható elő nyilvánosan digitálisan. A Mű minden egyes másolatához vagy hangfelvételéhez, amelyet a Felhasználó terjeszt, nyilvánosan bemutat, nyilvánosan előad vagy nyilvánosan digitálisan előad, jelen Licenc egy példányát, illetve az Egységes Forrásazonosító Kódját (internet-címét) mellékelni kell. A Műre vonatkozóan nem ajánlható és nem szabható olyan feltétel, amely jelen Licenc feltételeit megváltoztatja vagy korlátozza, illetve a kedvezményezett számára biztosított jogok gyakorlását korlátozza. A Műre vonatkozóan nem lehet további felhasználási engedélyt adni. A jelen Licencre, garanciákra, jogról való lemondásra vonatkozó valamennyi figyelmeztetést változatlan formában kell feltüntetni. A Művet nem lehet terjeszteni, nyilvánosan bemutatni, nyilvánosan előadni, nyilvánosan digitálisan előadni olyan műszaki eszközzel, amely a Licenc Szerződésben foglaltakkal ellentétesen korlátozza a Műhöz való hozzáférést, illetve a Műhöz fűződő felhasználási jogot. A fenti feltétel vonatkozik a Kollektív Műben foglalt Műre, ugyanakkor nem teszi szükségessé, hogy a Kollektív Mű magától a Műtől elkülönülve a jelen Licenc hatálya alá essék. Amennyiben a Felhasználó Kollektív Művet hoz létre, akár az Eredeti Szerző, akár a Jogosult felszólítására annak kívánsága szerint köteles az indokolt mértékben a Kollektív Műből eltávolítani valamennyi, az érintettekre történő hivatkozást összhangban a 4 (b)-vel. Amennyiben a Felhasználó Származékos Művet hoz létre, akár az Eredeti Szerző, akár a Jogosult felszólítására annak kívánsága szerint köteles az indokolt mértékben a Származékos Műből eltávolítani valamennyi, az érintettekre történő hivatkozást összhangban a 4 (b)-vel.
Amennyiben a Felhasználó a Művet, a Származékos Művet vagy a Kollektív Művet terjeszti, nyilvánosan bemutatja, nyilvánosan előadja, illetve nyilvánosan digitálisan előadja, a Műre vonatkozó szerzői joggal kapcsolatos figyelmeztetést a médiának vagy a használt eszköznek megfelelően fel kell tüntetni: (i) az eredeti szerző nevét (vagy művésznevét, ha azt használ), illetve (ii) ha az Eredeti Szerző, illetve a Jogosult megjelöl más személyt vagy személyeket (pl. támogató intézet, kiadó, újság) a jogosult szerzői jogi jelzésében a megjelölést, a szolgáltatás feltételeit vagy más megfelelő eszközzel ezen személy vagy személyek nevét; a Mű címét, ha szükséges; a szükséges terjedelemben a Jogosult által meghatározott Egységes Forrásazonosítót (internet-címét), ha az Egységes Forrásazonosító (internet-cím) nem tartalmaz a Mű szerzői jogával kapcsolatos figyelmeztetést vagy megfelelő Licenc-információt; a Származékos Mű esetében egy megjelölést arra vonatkozóan, hogy a Művet Származékos Műben használják fel (pl. „az Eredeti Szerző Művének francia fordítása”, vagy az „Eredeti Szerző Művén alapuló TV-játék”). Ezt a hivatkozást a szokásos módon kell feltüntetni, feltéve ugyanakkor, hogy a Származékos Mű vagy Kollektív Mű esetében egy minimum-hivatkozásnak kell megjelennie ott, ahol más hasonló szerzőség-megjelölés van, és olyan módon, amely legalább annyira feltűnő, mint más hasonló szerzőség-megjelölés.
5. Kifogás, garancia és kizárás
A FELEK ELTÉRŐ ÍRÁSOS MEGÁLLAPODÁSA HIÁNYÁBAN A JOGOSULT SEMMILYEN KIFOGÁST NEM ISMER EL ÉS SEMMILYEN GARANCIÁT NEM VÁLLAL A MŰVEL KAPCSOLATBAN FELMERÜLŐ BÁRMELY - AKÁR KIFEJEZETT, AKÁR REJTETT -, SZABÁLYOZÁSI VAGY MÁS HIBÁRA, KORLÁTOZÁS NÉLKÜL IDEÉRTVE A CÍMRE, AZ ÉRTÉKESÍTHETŐSÉGRE, A KÜLÖNLEGES CÉLOKNAK VALÓ MEGFELELŐSÉGRE, JOGSZERŰSÉGRE, REJTETT VAGY MÁS HIBÁK HIÁNYÁRA, PONTOSSÁGRA VAGY TÉVEDÉSEK HIÁNYÁRA VONATKOZÓ GARANCIÁT, AKÁR FELFEDEZHETŐK ILYENEK, AKÁR NEM. NÉHÁNY JOGRENDSZER NEM ENGEDI A BELEÉRTETT GARANCIÁK KIZÁRÁSÁT, EZEKBEN AZ ESETEKBEN ILYEN KIZÁRÁS NEM ALKALMAZHATÓ A FELHASZNÁLÓ TEKINTETÉBEN.
6. Felelősségkorlátozás AZ ALKALMAZANDÓ JOG ÁLTAL MEGKÖVETELT TERJEDELEM KIVÉTELÉVEL EGYETLEN ESETBEN SEM FELEL A JOGOSULT A FELHASZNÁLÓNAK EGYETLEN JOGI ELMÉLET ALAPJÁN SEM BÁRMELY KÜLÖNLEGES, VÉLETLENSZERŰ, JÁRULÉKOS, BÜNTETŐ MÉRTÉKŰ VAGY A KÁROKOZÁS FELTŰNŐ JOGELLENESSÉGE MIATT A KÁR TÉNYLEGES ÖSSZEGÉT MEGHALADÓ KÁRTÉRÍTÉSI IGÉNYŰ KÁRÉRT, AMELY EBBŐL A LICENCBŐL VAGY A MŰ FELHASZNÁLÁSÁBÓL ERED, MÉG AKKOR SEM, HA A JOGOSULT TÁJÉKOZTATÁST KAPOTT AZ ILYEN KÁROK LEHETŐSÉGÉRŐL.
7. Felmondás
Jelen Licenc és az általa biztosított jogok automatikusan megszűnnek a Felhasználóra vonatkozóan, amennyiben a Felhasználó megsérti jelen Licenc feltételeit. Ugyanakkor nem szűnik meg a Licenc hatálya azon harmadik személyek vonatkozásában, akik jelen Licenc hatálya alatt jutottak hozzá a Felhasználótól Kollektív Művekhez, amennyiben ezen harmadik személyek mindenben megfelelnek Licenceknek.

רישיון
היצירה (כהגדרתה להלן) ניתנת בכפוף לתנאי רישיון ציבורי זה ("הרישיון"). היצירה מוגנת בזכות יוצרים ו/או ע"פ דין אחר. אין להשתמש ביצירה שבנדון, אלא כמורשה על פי תנאי רישיון זה ודיני זכויות יוצרים
על ידי מימוש זכות מהזכויות ביצירה המוענקות על פי רישיון זה, הנך מקבל את תנאיו ומסכים להם. נותן הרישיון מעניק לך את הזכויות כמתואר בזאת כנגד הסכמתך לתנאים אלה.
א. הגדרות
"יצירה קיבוצית" היא יצירה, כגון גיליון עתי, אנתולוגיה או אנציקלופדיה, שבה היצירה שבנדון בשלמותה וללא שינוי, וכן מספר עבודות נוספות, המהוות לכשעצמן יצירות נפרדות ועצמאיות, נאספו לידי יחידה קיבוצית. יצירה המהווה יצירה קיבוצית לא תחשב יצירה נגזרת (כהגדרתה להלן) לצורך רישיון זה.
"יצירה נגזרת" היא יצירה המבוססת על היצירה שבנדון או על היצירה שבנדון ועל יצירות קודמות אחרות, כגון תרגום, עיבוד מוזיקלי, דרמטיזציה, הפיכה לרומן, עיבוד קולנועי, טביעה קולית, רפרודוקציה, תמצות, סיכום, או כל צורה אחרת בה ניתן לשכתב, לשנות או להתאים את היצירה שבנדון, ובלבד שיצירה המהווה יצירה קיבוצית לא תחשב יצירה נגזרת לצורך רישיון זה. למען הסר ספק, אם היצירה שבנדון היא יצירה מוזיקלית או טביעה קולית, סינכרוניזציה של היצירה באופן בו-זמני עם תמונות נעות ("synching") תחשב יצירה נגזרת לצורך רישיון זה.
"נותן הרישיון" הוא האדם או הישות המציע את היצירה בכפוף לתנאי רישיון זה.
"המחבר המקורי" הוא האדם או הישות אשר יצר את היצירה.
"היצירה" או "היצירה שבנדון" היא היצירה בת-ההגנה בזכות יוצרים המוצעת על פי תנאי רישיון זה.
"אתה" הוא אדם או ישות המממש זכויות על פי תנאי רישיון זה ואשר לא הפר לפנים את תנאי רישיון זה ביחס ליצירה שבנדון או אשר קיבל במפורש רשות מנותן הרישיון לממש זכויות על פי רישיון זה למרות הפרה קודמת.
ב. היקף הזכויות. אין ברישיון זה להגביל או לגרוע מכל זכות טיפול הוגן, זכות שימוש פרטי וביתי (ע"פ סעיף 3ג לפקודת זכות יוצרים) או מכל הגבלה אחרת על הזכויות הבלעדיות של בעל זכות יוצרים על פי דיני זכויות יוצרים או על פי כל דין אחר. למען הסר ספק, אין ברישיון זה להגביל אותך מביצוע שימוש ביצירה שאינו מצריך רישיון מבעל הזכויות ביצירה על פי דיני זכויות יוצרים או על פי כל דין אחר. 
ג. הענקת רישיון. בכפוף לתנאי רישיון זה, נותן הרישיון מעניק לך בזאת רישיון כלל-עולמי, ללא תמלוגים, לא בלעדי, בלתי-מוגבל בזמן (למשך תקופת ההגנה לזכות היוצרים ביצירה שבנדון) לממש את הזכויות ביצירה שבנדון כמפורט להלן:
להעתיק את היצירה, לשלבה ביצירה קיבוצית, אחת או יותר, ולהעתיק את היצירה כשהיא משולבת ביצירות קיבוציות;
ליצור יצירות נגזרות ולהעתיקן;
להפיץ עותקים או תקליטים של היצירה שבנדון, להציגה בפומבי ולבצעה בפומבי, לרבות במסגרת יצירות קיבוציות;
להפיץ עותקים או תקליטים של יצירות נגזרות, להציגן בפומבי, ולבצען בפומבי.
למען הסר ספק, אם היצירה שבנדון היא יצירה מוזיקלית:
תמלוגים בגין ביצוע בפומבי על פי "רישיונות שמיכה" (רישיונות גורפים או "blanket licenses"). נותן הרישיון מוותר על הזכות הייחודית לגבות, בעצמו או באמצעות איגוד זכויות יוצרים ומבצעים (כגון אקו"ם, ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), תמלוגים בגין ביצוע בפומבי (לדוגמא webcast) של היצירה.
"זכויות מכאניות" ותמלוגים על פי חוק (סטטוטוריים). נותן הרישיון מוותר על הזכות הייחודית לגבות, בעצמו או באמצעות סוכנות זכויות מוזיקליות או סוכן שמונה לצורך העניין (כגון הפדרציה הישראלית לתקליטים וקלטות, Harry Fox Agency), תמלוגים בגין כל תקליט שתיצור מהיצירה שבנדון ("גרסת כיסוי" - "cover version") ושתפיץ, בכפוף לרישיון הכפייה המעוגן בסעיף 19 לחוק זכות יוצרים, 1911 (או על פי הדין המקביל בתחומי שיפוט אחרים).
זכויות Webcasting ותמלוגים על פי חוק (סטטוטוריים). למען הסר ספק, אם היצירה שבנדון היא טביעה קולית, נותן הרישיון מוותר על הזכות הייחודית לגבות, בעצמו או באמצעות איגוד זכויות יוצרים ומבצעים (כגון SoundExchange) תמלוגים בגין ביצוע בפומבי באמצעים דיגיטאליים (לדוגמא webcast) של היצירה, בכפוף לרישיון הכפייה המעוגן בסעיף 17 USC 114 לחוק זכויות היוצרים האמריקאי (או על פי הדין המקביל בתחומי שיפוט אחרים).
ובלבד שאין בכך משום סילוף, פגימה, שינוי או כל פעולה שיש בה משום הפחתת ערך ביחס ליצירה, העלולים לפגוע בכבודו או בשמו של המחבר המקורי.
ניתן לממש את הזכויות הנ"ל בכל מדיה או פורמט, בין אם הוא ידוע כיום ובין אם יומצא לאחר מכן. הזכויות לעיל כוללות את הזכות לבצע שינויים הנדרשים מבחינה טכנית על מנת לממש את הזכויות במדיה או פורמטים אחרים. נותן הרישיון שומר לעצמו בזאת כל זכות שלא הוענקה במפורש.
ד. הגבלות. הרישיון על פי סעיף ג' לעיל ניתן במפורש בכפוף להגבלות הבאות:
אתה רשאי להפיץ את היצירה, להציגה בפומבי או לבצעה בפומבי אך ורק בכפוף לרישיון זה. עליך לכלול עותק של רישיון זה או את ה- Uniform Resource Identifier של רישיון זה בכל עותק או תקליט של היצירה, אשר אתה מפיץ, מציג בפומבי או מבצע בפומבי. אינך רשאי להציע או להציב תנאים ביחס ליצירה שבנדון, אשר משנים או מגבילים את תנאי רישיון זה או את מימוש הזכויות המוענקות על פי רישיון זה על ידי מקבלי היצירה. אינך רשאי להעניק רישיון-משנה ביצירה שבנדון. עליך להשאיר כמות שהן את כל ההודעות ביחס לרישיון זה ואת הודעת הסרת האחריות. אינך רשאי להפיץ את היצירה, להציגה בפומבי או לבצעה בפומבי תוך שימוש באמצעים טכניים השולטים בגישה או בשימוש ביצירה שבנדון באופן שאינו עולה בקנה אחד עם תנאי רישיון זה. האמור לעיל חל על היצירה כשהיא במסגרת יצירה קיבוצית, אולם אין הדבר מחייב שהיצירה הקיבוצית, לבד מהיצירה שבנדון עצמה, תהיה כפופה לתנאי רישיון זה. היה ויצרת יצירה קיבוצית, עם קבלת הודעה מכל נותן רישיון עליך להסיר מהיצירה הקיבוצית, ככל שניתן מבחינה מעשית, כל ייחוס על-פי סעיף ד(2), כפי שנדרש. היה ויצרת יצירה נגזרת, עם קבלת הודעה  מכל נותן רישיון  עליך להסיר  מהיצירה הנגזרת,  ככל שניתן מבחינה מעשית,  כל ייחוס על-פי סעיף
ד(2), כפי שנידרש.
היה ותפיץ, תציג בפומבי או תבצע בפומבי את היצירה או כל יצירה נגזרת או יצירה קיבוצית, עליך להשאיר כמות שהן את כל הודעות זכות היוצרים ביחס ליצירה שבנדון ולציין בהיקף ובמידה המקובלים בהתאם לתווך או לאמצעים בהם הנך עושה שימוש (א) את השם (או הפסבדונים, לפי המקרה) של המחבר המקורי, אם נמסר ו/או (ב) אם המחבר המקורי ו/או נותן הרישיון קבעו, בהודעת זכות היוצרים של נותן הרישיון, בתנאי השימוש או באופן סביר אחר, צד או צדדים אחרים (כגון מוסד מממן, מוציא לאור, כתב-עת) לעניין ייחוס היצירה, הרי שאת שמו של צד או צדדים אלה; את שם היצירה, אם נמסר; ככל שניתן באופן סביר, את ה-Uniform Resource Identifier, שאותו קישר נותן הרישיון עם היצירה, אם קיים, אלא אם אותו Uniform Resource Identifier אינו מתייחס להודעת זכות היוצרים או למידע בנוגע לרישיון ביצירה שבנדון; ולגבי יצירה נגזרת, תיאור השימוש ביצירה שבנדון במסגרת היצירה הנגזרת (לדוגמא, "תרגום לצרפתית של [שם היצירה] על ידי [המחבר המקורי]", או "תסריט מבוסס על [שם היצירה המקורית] של [המחבר המקורי]"). ייחוס היצירה כאמור עשוי להיות מיושם בכל אופן סביר, ובלבד שלגבי יצירה נגזרת או יצירה קיבוצית, יופיע הייחוס, לכל הפחות, במקום בו מופיע כל ייחוס דומה ובאופן בולט לכל הפחות ככל ייחוס דומה אחר.
ה. מצגים, אחריות והסרת אחריות. אלא אם הוסכם אחרת  על ידי הצדדים בכתב,  היצירה מוצעת על ידי נותן הרישיון  כמות שהיא ("AS IS") ללא כל מצגים וללא נטילת אחריות (“warranties") מכל סוג בנוגע ליצירה, מפורשת, משתמעת, על פי חוק או בכל אופן אחר, לרבות, ללא הגבלה, נטילת אחריות לגבי בעלות, סחירות, התאמה למטרה מסוימת, אי-הפרה, או לגבי העדר פגמים נסתרים או אחרים, דיוק, או לגבי המצאות או העדר טעויות, בין אם הן ניתנות לגילוי ובין אם אינן. תחומי שיפוט מסוימים אינם מתירים החרגת אחריות משתמעת (“exclusion of implied warranties"), ולכן יתכן שהחרגה כזאת אינה חלה עליך.
ו. הגבלת אחריות. למעט כנדרש על פי כל דין, נותן הרישיון לא יהיה אחראי כלפיך בכל מקרה על סמך כל בסיס משפטי לנזקים מיוחדים, נלווים, תוצאתיים, עונשיים או נזקים לדוגמא כתוצאה מרישיון זה או כתוצאה מהשימוש ביצירה שבנדון, גם אם נמסר לנותן הרישיון על אפשרות התרחשות נזקים אלה.
ז. סיום הרישיון
רישיון זה והזכויות המוענקות על פיו יסתיימו באופן אוטומטי עם הפרת תנאי הרישיון על ידך. עם זאת, לא יסתיימו הרישיונות לבני אדם או ישויות אשר קיבלו יצירה נגזרת או יצירה קיבוצית ממך על פי רישיון זה, ובלבד שימשיכו לקיים את תנאי הרישיונות הללו במלואם. סעיפים א', ב', ה', ו', ז', ו-ח' יישארו בתוקף לאחר סיום הרישיון.
בכפוף לתנאים לעיל, רישיון זה אינו מוגבל בזמן (למשך תקופת ההגנה לזכות היוצרים ביצירה שבנדון). למרות האמור לעיל, נותן הרישיון שומר את הזכות להעניק רישיון ביצירה שבנדון בכפוף לתנאי רישיון שונים או להפסיק את הפצת היצירה בכל עת, ובלבד שפעולה מעין זה – לא יהיה בה משום חזרה מרישיון זה (או מכל רישיון אחר אשר הוענק או שיש להעניקו על פי תנאי רישיון זה) ורישיון זה יישאר בתוקפו, אלא אם כן הסתיים כאמור לעיל.
ח. שונות
בכל פעם שאתה מפיץ או מבצע בפומבי באופן דיגיטאלי את היצירה או יצירה קיבוצית, נותן הרישיון מציע למקבל היצירה רישיון ליצירה שבנדון בתנאים זהים לאלה שניתנים לך על פי רישיון זה.
בכל פעם שאתה מפיץ יצירה נגזרת או מבצע אותה בפומבי באופן דיגיטאלי, נותן הרישיון מציע למקבל היצירה הנגזרת רישיון ליצירה שבנדון בתנאים זהים לאלה שניתנים לך על פי רישיון זה.
היה ותנאי מתנאי רישיון זה אינו תקף או אינו אכיף על פי כל דין, לא יהיה בכך להשפיע על תוקף או אכיפות יתר תנאי הרישיון, ותנאי זה ישונה במידה המועטה ככל שניתן על מנת שיהיה תקף ואכיף, ללא כל פעולה נוספת על ידי הצדדים להסכם זה.
צד לרישיון זה לא יחשב כמי שוויתר על תנאי מתנאי רישיון זה או כמי שהסכים להפרה, אלא אם הוויתור או ההסכמה נעשו בכתב ואותו צד חתם על כך.
רישיון זה מהווה את מלוא ההסכם בין הצדדים בנוגע ליצירה שבנדון. אין כל הבנות, הסכמים או מצגים בנוגע ליצירה שבנדון, אשר לא פורטו כאן. נותן הרישיון לא יהיה כפוף לתנאים נוספים, אשר עשויים להופיע בכל מסר ממך. לא ניתן לשנות רישיון זה ללא הסכם משותף בכתב בין נותן הרישיון לבינך.

You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.

YOU WARRANT THAT YOU ARE THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN YOU SUBMIT THEM TO CREATIVE COMMONS.
6. Limitation on Liability.

LA OBRA ESTÁ PROTEGIDA POR LA LEY DEL DERECHO DE AUTOR Y/O POR CUALQUIER OTRA LEY QUE RESULTE APLICABLE. CUALQUIER USO DISTINTO DEL AUTORIZADO POR LA PRESENTE LICENCIA O POR LA LEY DEL DERECHO DE AUTOR ESTÁ PROHIBIDO.

1. Definiciones
"Obra Colectiva" Sin perjuicio de lo dispuesto por la Ley Federal del Derecho de Autor (LFDA), una obra colectiva, bajo esta Licencia, es toda obra, como lo sería una publicación periódica, antología o enciclopedia, en la cual la Obra, en su totalidad y sin modificación alguna, y que junto con otras contribuciones que de igual manera constituyen obras independientes en sí mismas, integran una obra por sí sola. Para efectos de esta Licencia, una Obra Colectiva constituida de la manera descrita anteriormente no será considerada como una Obra Derivada (como se define posteriormente).
“Obra Derivada” Sin perjuicio de lo dispuesto por la LFDA, una obra derivada, bajo esta Licencia, es toda obra que se basa en la Obra o en la Obra y otras obras pre­existentes, tales como una traducción, arreglo musical, dramatización, adaptación ficticia o cinematográfica, grabación de audio o producción de fonograma, reproducción artística, compendio o cualquier otra forma en la cual la Obra sea modificada, transformada o adaptada, a menos que constituya una Obra Colectiva de acuerdo a los términos antes descritos, en cuyo caso no será considerada, para efectos de esta Licencia, como una Obra Derivada. A fin de evitar cualquier duda, para efectos de esta Licencia, cuando la Obra en cuestión se trate de una composición musical o fonograma, la sincronización de dicha Obra con imágenes en movimiento regidas por una relación de tiempo será considerada como Obra Derivada.
"Licenciante” es el individuo o entidad que ofrece la Obra de conformidad con los términos y condiciones de la presente Licencia.
“Autor Original” es la persona física que ha creado la obra.
“Obra” Obra es toda aquella creación intelectual, susceptible de protección bajo la LFDA, ofrecida bajo los términos y condiciones de la presente Licencia.
“Usted” “Usted” se refiere a cualquier persona física o moral que, sin haber infringido previamente ninguno de los términos y condiciones de la presente Licencia en relación a la Obra, ejerza los derechos concedidos en la misma o que, aun cuando previamente haya existido alguna violación de derechos, haya obtenido autorización expresa por parte del Licenciante para ejercerlos.
2. Derechos de uso legítimo Nada de lo dispuesto en la presente Licencia tiene por objeto reducir, limitar o restringir ninguno de los derechos previstos como de uso legítimo, surgidos de la doctrina norteamericana de primer venta o de cualquier otra limitación o excepción a los derechos patrimoniales concedidos al usuario de una obra por la LFDA o por cualquier otra ley aplicable.
3. Otorgamiento de la Licencia. De conformidad con los términos y condiciones previstos en la presente Licencia, el Licenciante le otorga a Usted una licencia universal, gratuita, no exclusiva y perpetua (entendiéndose que este término es determinado por la duración prevista en la LFDA para el otorgamiento de la protección intelectual específica) para ejercer los derechos descritos a continuación:
Reproducir la Obra, incorporarla a una o más Obras Colectivas y reproducirla como parte de una Obra Colectiva;
Crear y reproducir Obras Derivadas;
Distribuir copias o fonogramas de la Obra, representar y exhibir públicamente la Obra y representarla públicamente por medios digitales de transmisión de audio, incluyendo el caso en el que lo antes descrito sea incorporado a una Obra Colectiva.
Distribuir copias o fonogramas de Obras Derivadas, representar y exhibir públicamente Obras Derivadas y representarlas públicamente por medios digitales de transmisión de audio.
A fin de evitar dudas, cuando la Obra se trate de una composición musical:
Regalías por la representación de Obras bajo Licencias Colectivas. El Licenciante renuncia a su derecho exclusivo a recaudar, ya sea de manera individual o a través de sociedades de gestión colectiva, regalías por concepto de la representación o ejecución pública o de la representación o ejecución pública de tipo digital (tal como la transmisión vía Internet) de la Obra.
Regalías por la creación y distribución de versiones. El Licenciante renuncia a su derecho exclusivo a recaudar, ya sea de manera individual o a través de sociedades de gestión colectiva o representante especialmente designado, regalías por concepto de la creación, grabación y distribución de fonogramas que Usted lleve a cabo de la Obra (adaptaciones, versiones o interpretaciones de la misma Obra).
Derechos de Transmisión por vía Internet y Regalías Estatutorias (las previstas en ley). A fin de evitar dudas, en el caso en el que la Obra sea una grabación de audio o fonograma, el Licenciante renuncia a su derecho exclusivo a recaudar, ya sea de manera individual o a través de sociedades de gestión colectiva, regalías por concepto de la representación o ejecución pública de tipo digital (tal como la transmisión vía Internet) de la Obra.
Los derechos antes descritos podrán ser ejercidos en cualquier forma o por cualquier medio conocido o por conocer. Los derechos descritos incluyen el derecho a realizar las modificaciones tecnológicamente pertinentes para el ejercicio de los mismos en cualquier formato o medio. Cualquier otro derecho no expresamente mencionado en la presente Licencia se entiende reservado por el autor.
4. Restricciones. Los derechos conferidos en la sección 3 de la presente Licencia están sujetos a las siguientes restricciones:
Usted puede distribuir, exhibir públicamente, representar o ejecutar públicamente o representar o ejecutar públicamente de manera digital la Obra únicamente bajo los términos de la presente Licencia, y siempre y cuando incluya una copia de la presente Licencia o se haga referencia a la dirección electrónica del sitio en donde la misma se encuentre en cada una de las copias o fonogramas de la Obra que Usted distribuya, exhiba públicamente, represente o ejecute públicamente o represente o ejecute públicamente de manera digital. Le queda prohibido establecer o imponer cualquier término o condición que altere o restrinja los términos de la presente Licencia o los derechos aquí conferidos. De igual manera, le queda prohibido sublicenciar la Obra. Usted deberá mantener intactas todas las disposiciones relativas a la presente Licencia, incluyendo las referentes a la exclusión de garantía. Le queda prohibido distribuir, exhibir públicamente, representar o ejecutar públicamente o representar o ejecutar públicamente de manera digital la Obra incluyendo medidas tecnológicas que controlen el acceso a la Obra o el uso de la misma de forma incompatible con los términos de la presente Licencia. Lo descrito anteriormente aplica de igual manera al caso en el que la Obra se incorpore a una Obra Colectiva, sin que esto requiera que la Obra Colectiva en sí misma se sujete a los términos de la presente Licencia. Si Usted crea una Obra Colectiva, deberá, en la medida de lo posible, remover de dicha Obra Colectiva cualquier mención a que se hace referencia en la cláusula 4(b) de la presente Licencia en cuanto cualquiera de los Licenciantes le haga la notificación pertinente. Si Usted crea una Obra Derivada, deberá, en la medida de lo posible, remover de dicha Obra Derivada cualquier mención a que se hace referencia en la cláusula 4(b) de la presente Licencia en cuanto cualquiera de los Licenciantes le haga la notificación pertinente.
Si Usted distribuye, exhibe públicamente, representa o ejecuta públicamente o representa o ejecuta públicamente de manera digital la Obra, cualquier Obra Derivada u Obra Colectiva deberá mantener intactas todas y cada una de las menciones al Derecho de Autor de la Obra y mencionar, en la medida de lo razonablemente posible en relación al medio o medios utilizados: (i) el nombre del Autor Original (o el pseudónimo si ese es el caso) si éste es conocido o proporcionado, y/o (ii) el nombre de la(s) otra(s) persona(s) a quienes el Autor Original y/o el Licenciante (tal como un instituto patrocinador, casa editorial o revista de investigación) le atribuyan cierto crédito; el título de la Obra si éste se provee; la dirección electrónica que el Licenciante mencione como asociada a la Obra, en el caso en el que ésta exista y en la medida de lo razonablemente posible, a menos que dicha dirección electrónica no haga referencia a la información del Derecho de Autor pertinente o de la Licencia que regule la distribución de la Obra; y en el caso de una Obra Derivada, la mención que especifique el uso de la Obra dentro de la Obra Derivada (tal como “Traducción al Francés de la Obra... del Autor Original...” o “Guión cinematográfico basado en la Obra original... del Autor Original...”). En el caso de que se trate de una Obra Derivada o de una Obra Colectiva, dicho crédito o reconocimiento será otorgado de manera razonable, donde los demás reconocimientos de autoría aparezcan y en la misma manera en la que éstos aparezcan.
5. Declaraciones, Garantías y Exclusión de Responsabilidad.
SALVO QUE LAS PARTES ACUERDEN POR ESCRITO ALGO DISTINTO, EL LICENCIANTE OFRECE LA OBRA “TAL COMO ESTÁ” Y NO HACE DECLARACIONES CON RESPECTO A LA OBRA NI OFRECE NINGÚN TIPO DE GARANTÍA, YA SEA EXPRESA, IMPLÍCITA, LEGAL O DE OTRO TIPO, EXCLUYENDOSE DE MANERA ENUNCIATIVA MAS NO LIMITATIVA, DE LAS GARANTÍAS DE TITULARIDAD, DE QUE SEA ADECUADA O APROPIADA PARA EL USO ESPECÍFICO PARA EL QUE FUE DISEÑADA O PARA EL USO ESPECÍFICO PARA EL QUE SE NOTIFICÓ IBA O PODÍA SER UTILIZADA, DE NO VIOLACIÓN DE OTROS DERECHOS, DE LA AUSENCIA DE VICIOS OCULTOS U OTRO TIPO DE DEFECTOS O ERRORES O DE PRECISIÓN, YA SEA QUE SEAN EVIDENTES O NO. EN VIRTUD DE QUE CIERTOS PAÍSES NO ACEPTAN ESTAS EXCLUSIONES DE RESPONSABILIDAD, LO DISPUESTO EN ESTA CLAÚSULA PUEDE NO SER APLICABLE A SU CASO.
6. Limitación de Responsabilidad.
EXCEPTO POR LO DISPUESTO EN LA LEY APLICABLE, EN NINGÚN CASO Y POR NINGÚN MOTIVO SERÁ EL LICENCIANTE RESPONSABLE FRENTE A USTED POR DAÑOS ESPECIALES, INCIDENTALES, CONSECUENCIALES, PUNITIVOS U OTROS SIMILARES QUE SURJAN DE ESTA LICENCIA O DEL USO DE LA OBRA, AÚN CUANDO EL LICENCIANTE ADVIRTIERA QUE DICHOS DAÑOS PODÍAN SURGIR.
7. Terminación.
La presente Licencia y los derechos en ésta conferidos se rescindirán automáticamente en cuanto Usted infrinja o incumpla los términos y condiciones de la misma. No obstante, lo antes dispuesto no afectará a aquellas personas físicas o morales que hayan recibido Obras Derivadas u Obras Colectivas de Usted bajo la presente Licencia, siempre y cuando éstas se mantengan en pleno cumplimiento de la misma. Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 continuarán siendo válidas aún después de que esta Licencia se extinga.
Sujeto a los términos y condiciones antes mencionados, la presente Licencia es perpetua (por todo el término de protección conferido en la LFDA a la Obra). No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho a distribuir la Obra bajo los términos y condiciones de una licencia distinta o a dejar de distribuirla en cualquier momento, siempre y cuando dicha decisión no cumpla el propósito de revocar la presente Licencia (o cualquier otra licencia que haya sido o requiera ser otorgada bajo los términos y condiciones de la presente Licencia) y los términos y condiciones de la misma continúen surtiendo efectos y se mantengan en vigor, a menos que la Licencia se extinga de la manera antes descrita.
8. Misceláneos
Cada vez que Usted distribuya o represente o ejecute públicamente de manera digital la Obra o una Obra Colectiva, el Licenciante le otorga al usuario una licencia sobre la Obra en los mismos términos y condiciones aquí descritos.
Cada vez que Usted distribuya o represente o ejecute públicamente de manera digital una Obra Derivada, el Licenciante le otorga al usuario una licencia sobre la Obra en los mismos términos y condiciones aquí descritos.
El que alguna de las disposiciones descritas en la presente Licencia sea declarada inválida o incoercible de conformidad con la legislación aplicable no afectará la validez y coercibilidad del resto de las disposiciones contenidas en la presente Licencia. Las disposiciones que resulten inválidas o incoercibles serán modificadas para cumplir los requisitos mínimos indispensables para lograr esa validez y coercibilidad sin que se requiera para ello ninguna acción de las partes de la presente Licencia.
Ninguna de las disposiciones aquí mencionadas se entenderá renunciada ni se presumirá consentimiento otorgado a violación alguna a menos que dicha renuncia o consentimiento se haga por escrito y se firme por la persona con las facultades pertinentes.
La presente Licencia constituye la totalidad del acuerdo entre las partes en relación a la Obra. No existen acuerdos, convenios ni entendimientos con respecto a la Obra fuera de los aquí especificados. El Licenciante no se considerará obligado por disposiciones adicionales que aparezcan en cualquier comunicación con Usted.

1. Definiciones
"Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles" es aquella que en forma íntegra e inalterada se ensambla dentro de un conjunto colectivo a otras contribuciones que en sí mismas son también obras separadas e independientes, como sucede en las ediciones periódicas o antologías. La obra que integra una Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles no será considerada Obra Derivada (tal como abajo se define) para los propósitos de esta licencia.
"Obra Derivada" es aquella que se encuentra basada en una o varias obras preexistentes, tales como traducciones, arreglos musicales, dramatizaciones, novelizaciones, adaptaciones ficticias, versiones fílmicas, grabaciones de audio o producciones de fonogramas, reproducciones artísticas, compendios, resúmenes o cualquier otra modalidad en la cual la obra pueda ser reformada, transformada o adaptada. La Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles no será considerada Obra Derivada para los fines de esta licencia. Queda entendido que si la obra consiste en una composición musical o fonograma, la sincronización de la obra con una imagen en movimiento será considerada Obra Derivada a los efectos de esta licencia.
"Licenciante" es la persona natural o jurídica que ofrece la obra bajo los términos de esta licencia.
"Autor" es la persona natural que realiza la creación intelectual original.
"Obra" es la creación intelectual personal y original susceptible de protección por el derecho de autor, ofrecida bajo los términos de esta licencia.
"Usted" es la persona natural o jurídica que, sin haber infringido previamente ninguno de los términos y condiciones de la presente Licencia respecto a la Obra, ejercita los derechos otorgados sobre la misma; o que, no obstante una violación anterior de dichos derechos, ha obtenido autorización expresa por parte del Licenciante para ejercerlos.
"Comunicación pública" es todo el proceso necesario y conducente a que una o más personas, reunidas o no en un mismo lugar, puedan tener acceso a la obra sin previa distribución de ejemplares a cada una de ellas, por cualquier medio o procedimiento, análogo o digital, conocido o por conocerse, que sirva para difundir signos, palabras, sonidos o imágenes. Todo el proceso conducente a que la obra sea accesible al público constituye comunicación.
2. Usos honrados. Nada de lo establecido en esta licencia pretende reducir o restringir los derechos derivados de los usos honrados, doctrina de la primera venta u otras limitaciones o excepciones al derecho de explotación, prescritas por la Ley sobre el Derecho de Autor u otras normas aplicables.
3. Otorgamiento de la licencia. Conforme a los términos y condiciones de esta licencia, el Licenciante le otorga a Usted, por el plazo legal de protección de los derechos de autor, una licencia de ámbito mundial, a título gratuito, no exclusiva, para ejercer los siguientes derechos:
Reproducir la Obra, incorporarla a una o más Obras en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles y reproducirla tal como fue incorporada a una Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles;

Todos los demás derechos no expresamente otorgados por el Licenciente quedan reservados.
4. Restricciones. La licencia otorgada en la cláusula 3 que antecede, se encuentra expresamente sujeta y limitada a las restricciones siguientes:
Usted puede distribuir o comunicar públicamente la Obra sólo bajo los términos de esta Licencia, debiendo incluir una copia de la Licencia o la dirección electrónica donde ésta se encuentra (Identificador Uniforme de Recursos) en cada copia o fonograma de la Obra que Usted distribuya o comunique públicamente. Usted no debe proponer o imponer condiciones sobre la obra que alteren o restrinjan los términos de esta Licencia o el ejercicio de los derechos aquí otorgados. Está prohibido sublicenciar la Obra. Usted debe mantener intactas todas las disposiciones o advertencias que se refieran a la presente Licencia y a la limitación de garantías. Usted no debe distribuir o comunicar públicamente la Obra agregándole medidas tecnológicas que controlen el acceso o uso de la misma de una manera contraria a los términos de esta Licencia. Lo antedicho se aplica también cuando la Obra es incorporada a una Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles, lo que no implica que la Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles tenga que estar sujeta a los términos de esta licencia. Si Usted crea una Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles o una Obra Derivada, a solicitud de cualquier licenciante deberá retirar de dicha obra –en la medida de lo posible- cualquier crédito requerido por la cláusula 4(b), conforme a lo solicitado.
Si Usted distribuye o comunica públicamente la Obra o cualquier Obra Derivada u Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles, debe mantener intacta toda la información relativa al derecho de autor y suministrar, de acuerdo al medio que esté utilizando: (i) el nombre del Autor, si es que consta (o su pseudónimo, de ser aplicable), y/o (ii) el nombre o denominación de aquellos a quienes el Autor y/o Licenciante le reconozcan ciertos créditos (v.gr. a un instituto patrocinante, editor, publicación periódica), para que sean reconocidos en la información sobre los derechos de autor, en los términos del servicio o por otro medio que razonablemente cumpla con tal fin; el título de la Obra, si es que figura; en la medida de lo posible y de haberlo, el Identificador Uniforme de Recursos - IUR que el Licenciante mencione como asociado a la Obra, a menos que dicho IUR no se refiera a la información sobre derechos de autor o la licencia de la Obra; y, en el caso de una Obra Derivada, un crédito que reconozca el uso de la Obra en la Obra Derivada (v.gr. “Traducción al francés de la Obra del Autor” o “Guión cinematográfico basado en la Obra original del Autor”). Tales créditos pueden ser incluidos en cualquier forma que sea razonable; sin embargo, en el caso de la Obra Derivada o de la Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles, dicho crédito aparecerá como mínimo en el lugar y forma en que figure cualquier otro crédito de autoría comparable.
5. Exoneración de garantía y responsabilidad
A MENOS QUE LAS PARTES ACUERDEN POR ESCRITO ALGO DIFERENTE, EL LICENCIANTE OFRECE LA OBRA “TAL Y COMO ESTA” Y NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA RESPECTO DE LA MISMA, YA SEA EXPRESA, IMPLICITA, LEGAL O DE CUALQUIER OTRA CLASE, INCLUSIVE RESPECTO DE LA TITULARIDAD, CALIDAD COMERCIAL DE LA OBRA, SU ADECUACION A UN PROPOSITO PARTICULAR, EXACTITUD, LA NO INFRACCION DE ALGUNA NORMA, LA AUSENCIA DE DEFECTOS MANIFIESTOS U OCULTOS O DE ERRORES QUE PUEDAN O NO SER DESCUBIERTOS. CIERTAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE TALES GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE PODRIAN NO SER APLICABLES A USTED.
6. Limitación de responsabilidad
CON EXCEPCION DE LO PRESCRITO POR LA LEY APLICABLE, EN NINGÚN CASO EL LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSABLE ANTE USTED POR CUALQUIER TIPO DE DAÑO, SEA CONTRACTUAL O EXTRACONTRACTUAL, MORAL O PATRIMONIAL, DERIVADO DEL USO DE ESTA LICENCIA O DE LA OBRA, INCLUSO SI EL LICENCIANTE HUBIERA SIDO ADVERTIDO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE TALES DAÑOS.
7. Terminación de la licencia
Esta Licencia y los derechos que ella confiere terminarán automáticamente si Usted incumple cualquiera de sus cláusulas. No obstante, lo antes dispuesto no afectará a aquellas personas naturales o jurídicas que hayan recibido de Usted Obras Derivadas u Obras en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles bajo la presente Licencia, siempre y cuando éstas continúen cumpliendo íntegramente la misma. Las cláusulas 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 continuarán vigentes, no obstante cualquier terminación de esta Licencia.
Sujeto a los términos y condiciones antes mencionados, la licencia otorgada es perpetua (hasta por la duración de los derechos patrimoniales sobre la Obra conferidos por el derecho de autor). Sin perjuicio de lo indicado, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho a publicar la Obra bajo una licencia diferente o a detener su distribución en cualquier momento. Ello no supondrá la terminación de esta licencia (o de cualquier otra que haya sido concedida o requiera serlo), la que continuará vigente y surtirá plenos efectos a menos que se disponga su terminación conforme a lo antes establecido.
8. Disposiciones varias
Cada vez que Usted distribuya o realice una ejecución pública digital de la Obra o de una Obra en Colaboración con Aportes Divisibles, el Licenciante le ofrece al receptor una licencia de la Obra en los mismos términos y condiciones que la licencia otorgada a Usted.
Cada vez que usted distribuya o realice una ejecución pública digital de una Obra Derivada, el Licenciante le ofrece al receptor una licencia de la Obra original en los mismos términos y condiciones que la licencia otorgada a Usted.
Si alguna disposición de esta Licencia resulta inválida o ineficaz según la ley aplicable, ello no afectará la validez o eficacia del resto de los términos de la misma. Sin acción ulterior de las partes, tal disposición se entenderá reformada en lo estrictamente necesario para que sea válida y eficaz.
No se entenderá que existe renuncia o consentimiento para incumplir algún término o disposición de esta Licencia, a menos que tal renuncia o consentimiento figure por escrito y esté firmado por la parte que renuncia o consiente.
Esta Licencia contiene el acuerdo integral entre las partes con respecto a la Obra licenciada. No existen acuerdos, pactos o declaraciones con respecto a la Obra que no sean los aquí especificados.

O acima exposto aplica-se à Obra enquanto incorporada numa Obra Colectiva, mas tal não requer que a Obra Colectiva, para além da Obra em si, esteja igualmente sujeita aos termos da presente Licença. Se o Utilizador criar uma Obra Colectiva, mediante notificação de qualquer Licenciante, deverá, na medida do possível, remover da Obra Colectiva qualquer crédito, realizado nos termos da cláusula 4(b), conforme seja requerido.

Attribution 2.5 Scotland
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN AGENT-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
This Creative Commons Scotland public licence enables You to Use the Work worldwide provided that You keep to the terms of this Licence.
'The Licensor' (the Person offering the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence)
and
'You' (the Person acquiring rights under this Licence)
agree as follows:
1. Definitions of Capitalised Words
"Collective Work" means a work made up of the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with other work, assembled into a collective whole.
"Derivative Work" means a work that Uses the Work (or any substantial part of the Work) in any material form whatsoever (such as a translation, dramatisation, or abridgment), other than (i) as a whole and in unmodified form or (ii) by modifying it as may be technically necessary to Use it in a different mode or format; but a Collective Work is not a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Derogatory Treatment" means derogatory treatment as defined by section 80 of the Copyright Design and Patents Act 1988, except as allowed by that Act: and it has that meaning wherever that treatment may take place and whoever may carry it out.
"Licence Elements" means the following licence attributes indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution.
"Original Author" means the Person who created the Work.
"Person" means a natural person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.
"Use", as a verb, means doing any act which is restricted by copyright, whether in the original medium or any other; and includes modifying the Work as may be technically necessary to Use it in a different mode or format.
"Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence, and includes the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work.
Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.
2. The Rights Granted
2.1 The Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, licence to Use the Work for the duration of its copyright.
So you may, for example:
copy the Work, or create Derivative Works or incorporate it into a Collective Work;
copy Derivative Works, or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work; and
publish, perform or communicate the Work and/or Derivative Works and/or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work to anyone;
in any medium whether now known or created in the future.
2.2 However, this Licence does not allow you to:
impose any terms or any technological measures on the Work, or a Derivative Work, that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights;
sublicense the Work; or
subject the Work to Derogatory Treatment.
2.3 You must, if you publish or distribute the Work or any Derivative Work to anyone else in any way, give reasonable credit to the Original Author as follows:
by giving the name of the Original Author if that has been supplied; or a pseudonym if that has been supplied instead; and/or the name of any other person if that has been supplied for attribution in place of the Original Author;
by giving the title of the Work if that has been supplied;
by giving the Uniform Resource Identifier of the Work if that has been supplied, but you need not do so if this does not refer to its copyright terms or to its licensing information;
in the case of a Derivative Work, by identifying how the Work has been used (for example, "French translation of the Work by X", or "Screenplay based on original work by X"); and
in the case of a Derivative Work or a Collective Work, placing that credit in the same place, and at least as prominently, as any comparable authorship credit.
But, if what you are publishing or distributing is a Derivative Work or a Collective Work, you must remove any of these credits if you are asked to do so by the Licensor and if it is practicable to do so.
These are important conditions of this licence and if you fail to do so you will be in material breach of its terms.
2.4 The Original Author asserts the right to be identified as the original author of the Work; but only as and when required by clause 2.3 above.
2.5 You must also, if you publish or distribute the Work or any Derivative Work to anyone else in any way:
include a copy of this Licence (or its Uniform Resource Identifier) with it; and
keep intact any copyright notices for the Work and notices that refer to this Licence.
These are important conditions of this licence and if you fail to do so you will be in material breach of its terms.
2.6 Each time You publish the Work or any Derivative Work to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms and conditions as this Licence.
2.7 And:
the right to release the Work under different terms, or to stop distributing the Work, is reserved; and
all other rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved.
2.8 This Licence does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law (including fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement) to make any Use of this Work.
3. Warranties and Disclaimer
3.1 The Work is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy, of fitness for purpose, or otherwise.
4. Limit of Liability
4.1 Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor shall not be liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any Use under this Licence, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Licensor.
5. Termination
5.1 Any breach by You of the terms of this licence (for example, by distributing the work licensed without attributing authorship as appropriate) entitles the Licensor to terminate this Licence with immediate effect and without notice to you. Persons who have received the Work, Derivative Works, or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this Licence or a licence granted under clause 2.6 of this Licence.
5.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this licence, the Licensor may not terminate your rights under it.
5.3 Unless terminated under clause 5.1, this Licence is granted to you for the duration of copyright in the Work.
6. General
6.1 If any provision of this Licence is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence.
6.2 This Licence is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
6.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this Licence (for example, by distributing the work licensed without attributing authorship as appropriate) you will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this Licence or to complain of any breach by the Licensor.
6.4 Neither You, nor anyone else, may enforce any provision of this Licence by specific implement or interdict.
6.5 This Licence is governed by the law of Scotland and the parties accept the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Scotland to decide any action or claim directed against the Licensor.
6.6 If there is any dispute as to the meaning or effect of any provision of this Licence, it must so far as possible be read and given effect in a way that is compatible with the provisions of the Creative Commons generic licence, version 2.5, which has the same Licence Elements.
The Notice below is not part of this licence.
Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the Creative Commons Public Licence, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

"Licensgivare" betyder den fysiska eller juridiska person som erbjuder Verket under denna Licens.
"Upphovsman" betyder den fysiska eller juridiska person som skapat Verket.
"Licenstagaren" betyder den fysiska eller juridiska person som nyttjar sina rättigheter under denna Licens som inte tidigare har brutit mot villkoren i Licensen avseende Verket eller den som har erhållit ett uttryckligt medgivande från Licensgivaren att använda den Licens som erbjuds enligt Dessa Licensvillkor trots tidigare brott mot Licensvillkoren.

8. Övrigt
Varje gång Licenstagaren nyttjar (enligt punkt 3) ett Verk eller ett Samlingsverk, erbjuder Licensgivaren mottagaren av Verket samma Licens till Verket som Licenstagaren har erhållit och som följer av dessa villkor.
Varje gång Licenstagaren sprider, offentligen framför eller på annat sätt gör ett Bearbetat Verk tillgängligt för allmänheten, erbjuder Licensgivaren mottagaren av det ursprungliga Verket samma Licens till verket som Licenstagaren har erhållit och som följer av dessa villkor.
Om någon del av Licensen skulle befinnas vara ogiltig, otillåten eller overkställbar skall detta inte påverka giltigheten av övriga bestämmelser som skall fortsätta att äga giltighet. Villkor som befinns vara ogiltiga, otillåtna eller overkställbara skall, i den mån så är möjligt, jämkas så att de blir giltiga, tillåtna respektive verkställbara och därvid i så hög utsträckning som möjligt tolkas i enlighet med parternas ursprungliga intentioner.
Part skall inte anses ha avstått från att göra villkor gällande eller tillåtit brott mot villkor om detta ej skett skriftligen.
Licensen skall utgöra parternas fullständiga reglering av allt som det berör, och alla skriftliga och muntliga åtaganden och utfästelser som föregått Licensen är utan verkan. Ändringar av Avtalet skall ske skriftligen och undertecknas av Licensgivaren och Licenstagaren för att vara gällande.

"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

CREATIVE COMMONS STELLT DIESE INFORMATIONEN OHNE GEWÄHR ZUR VERFÜGUNG. CREATIVE COMMONS ÜBERNIMMT KEINE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG FÜR DIE GELIEFERTEN INFORMATIONEN UND SCHLIEßT DIE HAFTUNG FÜR SCHÄDEN AUS, DIE SICH AUS DEREN GEBRAUCH ERGEBEN.

DER GEGENSTAND DIESER LIZENZ (WIE UNTER "SCHUTZGEGENSTAND" DEFINIERT) WIRD UNTER DEN BEDINGUNGEN DIESER CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL", "LIZENZ" ODER "LIZENZVERTRAG") ZUR VERFÜGUNG GESTELLT. DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER ANDERE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT. JEDE FORM DER NUTZUNG DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, DIE NICHT AUFGRUND DIESER LIZENZ ODER DURCH GESETZE GESTATTET IST, IST UNZULÄSSIG.
DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINES DURCH DIESE LIZENZ GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH EINVERSTANDEN. SOWEIT DIESE LIZENZ ALS LIZENZVERTRAG ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ GENANNTEN RECHTE UNENTGELTLICH UND IM AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN AKZEPTIEREN.
1. Definitionen
Der Begriff "Bearbeitung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange dieses erkennbar vom Schutzgegenstand abgeleitet wurde. Dies kann insbesondere auch eine Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes.
Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten zu einem einheitlichen Ganzen, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.
"Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Bearbeitungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt.
"Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und eine Erteilung, Übertragung oder Einräumung von Nutzungsbewilligungen bzw Nutzungsrechten an Dritte erlaubt.
Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine eigentümliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art oder ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff „Schutzgegenstand“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz.
Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährte Nutzungsbewilligung trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben.
Unter "Öffentlich Wiedergeben" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Wahrnehmbarmachungen des Schutzgegenstandes in unkörperlicher Form zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung oder zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zurverfügungstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.
"Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, gleichviel in welchem Verfahren, auf welchem Träger, in welcher Menge und ob vorübergehend oder dauerhaft, Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch das erstmalige Festhalten des Schutzgegenstandes oder dessen Wahrnehmbarmachung auf Mitteln der wiederholbaren Wiedergabe sowie das Herstellen von Vervielfältigungsstücken dieser Festhaltung, sowie die Speicherung einer geschützten Darbietung oder eines Bild- und/oder Schallträgers in digitaler Form oder auf einem anderen elektronischen Medium.
2. Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte
Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die sich aus den Beschränkungen der Verwertungsrechte, anderen Beschränkungen der Ausschließlichkeitsrechte des Rechtsinhabers oder anderen entsprechenden Rechtsnormen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung
Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz erteilt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.e) - die vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Urheberrechts oder verwandten Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte Nutzungsbewilligung, den Schutzgegenstand in der folgenden Art und Weise zu nutzen:
Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;
Den Schutzgegenstand zu bearbeiten, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jedweder Medien anzufertigen, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um eine Bearbeitung handelt;
Den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten; und
Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich wiederzugeben und zu verbreiten.
Bezüglich der Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechenden Vergütungsansprüche für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie geltend zu machen.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Geltendmachung der Vergütungsansprüche durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.
Die vorgenannte Nutzungsbewilligung wird für alle bekannten sowie alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Sie beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich vom Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf die Geltendmachung sämtlicher daraus resultierender Rechte.
4. Bedingungen
Die Erteilung der Nutzungsbewilligung gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dasselbe gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie - soweit dies praktikabel ist - auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.b) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung vornehmen, müssen Sie – soweit dies praktikabel ist – auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Bearbeitung die in Abschnitt 4.b) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen.
Die Verbreitung und die öffentliche Wiedergabe des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Inhalte oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Urheberschaft oder die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie selbst – soweit bekannt – Folgendes angeben:  
Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) Rechteinhabers, und/oder falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) („Zuschreibungsempfänger“), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
den Titel des Inhaltes;
in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand;
und im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine Bearbeitung handelt.
Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.b) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung aller Beitragenden dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Urhebers, des Lizenzgebers und/oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder implizit noch explizit irgendeine Verbindung mit dem oder eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch den Urheber, den Lizenzgeber oder den Zuschreibungsempfänger andeuten oder erklären.
Die oben unter 4.a) und b) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen.
(Urheber)Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt.
5. Gewährleistung
SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE ERTEILUNG DER NUTZUNGSBEWILLIGUNG UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN.
6. Haftungsbeschränkung
ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER 5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER IHNEN GEGENÜBER FÜR SCHÄDEN JEGLICHER ART NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG FÜR FOLGE- ODER ANDERE SCHÄDEN, AUCH WENN ER ÜBER DIE MÖGLICHKEIT IHRES EINTRITTS UNTERRICHTET WURDE.
7. Erlöschen
Diese Lizenz und die durch sie erteilte Nutzungsbewilligung erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Bearbeitungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke sowie entsprechende Vervielfältigungsstücke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort.
Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.
8. Sonstige Bestimmungen
Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Bearbeitung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich wiedergeben, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat.
Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß 8.a) und b) angebotenen Lizenzen aus.
Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Republik Österreich Anwendung.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Collection" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole. A Collection may, for example, include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purposes of this Licence.
"Derivative Work" means material in any form that is created by editing, modifying or adapting the Work, a substantial part of the Work, or the Work and other pre-existing works. Derivative Works may, for example, include a translation, adaptation, musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be transformed or adapted, except that a Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public by any means, including publication, electronic communication, or broadcast.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this Licence.
"Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work.
"Reproduce" means to make a copy of the Work in any material form (eg storage in digital form).
"Work" means the material (including any work or other subject matter) protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. This may include (without limitation) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; a sound recording or cinematograph film; a published edition of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or a television or sound broadcast.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights
Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions under copyright law or any other applicable laws.
3. Licence Grant
3A Grant of Rights
Provided that the terms set out in this Licence are satisfied, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the following rights:
Reproduce the Work;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any Collection;
create and Reproduce one or more Derivative Works; and
Distribute and publicly perform the Work, a Derivative Work or the Work as incorporated in any Collection.
3B Media and Formats
The above rights may be exercised in any media or format whether now known or hereafter created. They include the right to make modifications that are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
3C Other Rights Reserved
All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
4. Restrictions
The licence granted above is limited by the following restrictions.
4A Restrictions on Distribution and Public Performance of the Work
You may Distribute and publicly perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
You are not granted the right to sublicense the Work. The rights of recipients of the Work from You are governed by clause 9.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, You must not impose any technological measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other material within the Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work itself, to be made subject to this Licence.
4B Attribution and Notice Requirements
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Work or Collection You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work.
When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Work or Collection You must provide, in a manner reasonable to the medium or means You are using:
the name or pseudonym (if provided) of the Original Author and/or of any other party (such as a sponsor institute, publishing entity or journal) that the Original Author or Licensor has requested be attributed (such as in the copyright notice or terms of use). In this clause 4B these parties are referred to as "Attribution Parties";
the title of the Work (if provided); and
to the extent reasonably practicable, any Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a web link) that the Licensor specifies should be associated with the Work that refers to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
For any Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly perform, You must take reasonable steps to clearly identify that changes were made to the Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish".
In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the above attribution should, at a minimum, appear as part of any credits for other contributing authors and be as prominent as the credits for those other authors.
You must, to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any Collection or Derivative Work if requested to do so by the Licensor or Original Author.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this clause 4B for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above. By exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must not assert or imply:
any connection between the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party and You or Your use of the Work; or
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor or any other Attribution Party of You or Your use of the Work,
without their separate, express prior written permission.
4C Moral Rights
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4C, "moral rights" means the personal rights granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX of the Copyright Act 1968(Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have authorship falsely attributed.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor offers the Work "as-is" and makes no representations, warranties or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, any representations, warranties or conditions regarding:
the contents or accuracy of the Work;
title, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose;
non-infringement;
the absence of latent or other defects; or
the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, imply certain warranties and conditions in certain circumstances, such as the right to supply or fitness for purpose of goods or services supplied to a consumer. Clause 5(a) cannot and is not intended to exclude, restrict or modify these warranties.
6. Limit of Liability
To the full extent permitted by applicable law, and except for any liability arising from contrary agreement, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal basis (including without limitation, negligence) for any loss or damage whatsoever, including (without limitation):
loss of production or operation time, loss, damage or corruption of data or records; or
loss of anticipated savings, opportunity, revenue, profit or goodwill, or other economic loss; or
any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Licence or the use of the Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
If applicable legislation implies warranties or conditions, or imposes obligations or liability on the Licensor in respect of this Licence that cannot be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified, the Licensor’s liability is limited, to the full extent permitted by the applicable legislation, at its option, to:
in the case of goods, any one or more of the following:
the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
the repair of the goods;
the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods;
the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
in the case of services:
the supplying of the services again; or
the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and Territory fair trading legislation, restrict the limitation of liability in certain circumstances, such as a contract for the supply of goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic, or household use. Clauses 6(a) and 6(b) cannot and are not intended to apply in circumstances where it is prohibited by law.
7. Termination
This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals or entities who have received a Derivative Work or a Collection from You pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided they remain in full compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of this Licence.
8. Licensor’s Rights Retained
Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such release will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work from You
Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, a Derivative Work or a Collection the Licensor offers the recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms as are granted to You under this Licence.
10. Severability
If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence. Without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
11. Waivers and Consents
No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the relevant party.
12. Entire Agreement
This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. To the full extent permitted by law, there are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may not be modified without the written agreement of the Licensor and You.
13. Governing Law
The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by the laws in force in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.

Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Os direitos acima incluem o direito de fazer as modificações que forem tecnicamente necessárias para exercer os direitos em outras mídias, meios e formatos. Todos os direitos não concedidos expressamente pelo Licenciante ficam ora reservados.
4. Restrições. A licença concedida na Seção 3 acima está expressamente sujeita e limitada pelas seguintes restrições:
Você pode Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra apenas sob os termos desta Licença, e Você deve incluir uma cópia desta Licença ou o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (Uniform Resource Identifier) para esta Licença em cada cópia da Obra que você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente. Você não poderá oferecer ou impor quaisquer termos sobre a Obra que restrinjam os termos desta Licença ou a habilidade do destinatário exercer os direitos a ele aqui concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. Você não pode sublicenciar a Obra. Você deverá manter intactas todas as informações que se referem a esta Licença e à exclusão de garantias em toda cópia da Obra que Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente. Quando Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra, Você não poderá impor qualquer medida tecnológica eficaz à Obra que restrinja a possibilidade do destinatário exercer os direitos concedidos a ele sob os termos desta Licença. Esta Seção 4(a) se aplica à Obra enquanto quando incorporada em uma Obra Coletiva, mas isto não requer que a Obra Coletiva, à parte da Obra em si, esteja sujeita aos termos desta Licença. Se Você criar uma Obra Coletiva, em havendo notificação de qualquer Licenciante, Você deve, na medida do razoável, remover da Obra Coletiva qualquer crédito, conforme estipulado na Seção 4(b), quando solicitado. Se Você criar uma Obra Derivada, em havendo aviso de qualquer Licenciante, Você deve, na medida do possível, retirar da Obra Derivada qualquer crédito conforme estipulado na Seção 4(b), de acordo com o solicitado.
Se Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra ou qualquer Obra Derivada ou Obra Coletiva, Você deve, a menos que um pedido relacionado à Seção 4(a) tenha sido feito, manter intactas todas as informações relativas a direitos autorais sobre a Obra e exibir, de forma razoável em relação ao meio ou mídia por Você utilizado: (i) o nome do Autor Original (ou seu pseudônimo, se for o caso), se fornecido, do Titular de Direitos Conexos, se fornecido e quando aplicável, e/ou, ainda, se o Autor Original/Titular de Direitos Conexos e/ou o Licenciante designar outra parte ou partes (p. ex.: um instituto patrocinador, editora, periódico) para atribuição (“Partes de Atribuição”) nas informações relativas aos direitos autorais do Licenciante, termos de serviço ou por outros meios razoáveis, o nome dessa parte ou partes; (ii) o título da Obra, se fornecido; (iii) na medida do razoável, o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante especificar para estar associado à Obra, se houver, exceto se o URI não se referir ao aviso de direitos autorais ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento da Obra; e, (iv) em conformidade com a Seção 3(b), no caso de Obra Derivada, crédito identificando o uso da Obra na Obra Derivada (p. ex.: "Tradução Francesa da Obra do Autor Original/Titular de Direitos Conexos", ou "Roteiro baseado na Obra original do Autor Original/Titular de Direitos Conexos"). O crédito exigido por esta Seção 4(b), pode ser implementado de qualquer forma razoável; desde que, entretanto, no caso de uma Obra Derivada ou Obra Coletiva, na indicação de crédito feita aos autores participantes da Obra Derivada ou Obra Coletiva, o crédito apareça como parte dessa indicação, e de modo ao menos tão proeminente quanto os créditos para os outros autores participantes. De modo a evitar dúvidas, Você apenas poderá fazer uso do crédito exigido por esta Seção para o propósito de atribuição na forma estabelecida acima e, ao exercer Seus direitos sob esta Licença, Você não poderá implícita ou explicitamente afirmar ou sugerir qualquer vínculo, patrocínio ou apoio do Autor Original, Titular de Direitos Conexos, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição, o que for cabível, por Você ou Seu uso da Obra, sem a prévia e expressa autorização do Autor Original, Titular de Direitos Conexos, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição.

EM JURISDIÇÕES QUE NÃO ACEITEM A EXCLUSÃO DE GARANTIAS IMPLÍCITAS, ESTAS EXCLUSÕES PODEM NÃO SE APLICAR A VOCÊ.
6. Limitação de responsabilidade. EXCETO NA EXTENSÃO EXIGIDA PELA LEI APLICÁVEL, EM NENHUMA CIRCUNSTÂNCIA O LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PARA COM VOCÊ POR QUAISQUER DANOS, ESPECIAIS, INCIDENTAIS, CONSEQÜENCIAIS, PUNITIVOS OU EXEMPLARES, ORIUNDOS DESTA LICENÇA OU DO USO DA OBRA, MESMO QUE O LICENCIANTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO SOBRE A POSSIBILIDADE DE TAIS DANOS.
7. Terminação
Esta Licença e os direitos aqui concedidos terminarão automaticamente no caso de qualquer violação dos termos desta Licença por Você.

Não obstante o disposto acima, o Licenciante reserva-se o direito de difundir a Obra sob termos diferentes de licença ou de cessar a distribuição da Obra a qualquer momento; desde que, no entanto, quaisquer destas ações não sirvam como meio de retratação desta Licença (ou de qualquer outra licença que tenha sido concedida sob os termos desta Licença, ou que deva ser concedida sob os termos desta Licença) e esta Licença continuará válida e eficaz a não ser que seja terminada de acordo com o disposto acima.
8. Outras disposições.
Cada vez que Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente a Obra ou uma Obra Coletiva, o Licenciante oferece ao destinatário uma licença da Obra nos mesmos termos e condições que a licença concedida a Você sob esta Licença.
Cada vez que Você Distribuir ou Executar Publicamente uma Obra Derivada, o Licenciante oferece ao destinatário uma licença à Obra original nos mesmos termos e condições que foram concedidos a Você sob esta Licença.
Se qualquer disposição desta Licença for tida como inválida ou não-executável sob a lei aplicável, isto não afetará a validade ou a possibilidade de execução do restante dos termos desta Licença e, sem a necessidade de qualquer ação adicional das partes deste acordo, tal disposição será reformada na mínima extensão necessária para tal disposição tornar-se válida e executável.
Nenhum termo ou disposição desta Licença será considerado renunciado e nenhuma violação será considerada consentida, a não ser que tal renúncia ou consentimento seja feito por escrito e assinado pela parte que será afetada por tal renúncia ou consentimento.
Esta Licença representa o acordo integral entre as partes com respeito à Obra aqui licenciada. Não há entendimentos, acordos ou declarações relativas à Obra que não estejam especificados aqui. O Licenciante não será obrigado por nenhuma disposição adicional que possa aparecer em quaisquer comunicações provenientes de Você.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IST KEINE ANWALTSKANZLEI UND BIETET KEINE RECHTLICHEN AUSKÜNFTE BZW. DIENSTLEISTUNGEN AN. DIE VERBREITUNG DIESER LIZENZ FÜHRT NICHT ZU EINEM MANDATSVERHÄLTNIS DES EMPFÄNGERS MIT CREATIVE COMMONS. CREATIVE COMMONS ÜBERNIMMT KEINE GEWÄHR FÜR DIE ZUR VERFÜGUNG GESTELLTEN INFORMATIONEN UND LEHNT JEGLICHE HAFTUNG FÜR SCHÄDEN AB, DIE AUS DEM GEBRAUCH DIESER INFORMATIONEN ERWACHSEN. DIESER AUSSCHLUSS VON GEWÄHRLEISTUNG UND HAFTUNG ERSTRECKT SICH AUCH AUF DIE PERSONEN, DIE AN DER ADAPTIERUNG DES VORLIEGENDEN LIZENZTEXTS ANS SCHWEIZERISCHE RECHT MITGEWIRKT HABEN.
Lizenz
Durch die Ausübung eines durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechts an dem Lizenzgegenstand erklären Sie sich mit den Lizenzbedingungen rechtsverbindlich einverstanden. Soweit diese Lizenz als Vertrag anzusehen ist, gewährt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber die in der Lizenz genannten Rechte unentgeltlich und im Austausch dafür, dass Sie das Gebundensein an die Lizenzbedingungen akzeptieren.
Der „Lizenzgeber“, d.h. die Person, welche den Lizenzgegenstand unter dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung stellt,  und  „Sie“, d.h. die natürliche oder juristische Person, welche die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannten Nutzungen des Lizenzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand nicht gegen die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstossen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstosses auszuüben,  vereinbaren mit dieser Creative Commons Public License („CCPL“ oder „Lizenz“) die Nutzungsbedingungen für den Lizenzgegenstand,  im Einzelnen:
1. Definitionen
„Lizenzgegenstand“ kann ein urheberrechtlich geschütztes Werk sein oder eine durch verwandte Schutzrechte geschützte Leistung.
Eine „Sammlung“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist eine Zusammenstellung des Lizenzgegenstands mit anderen Werken oder sonstigen Elementen, unabhängig davon, ob an der Sammlung selbst aufgrund der Anordnung oder der Auswahl des Inhalts ein Urheberrecht entsteht. Als Sammlung gelten auch Datenbanken, unabhängig davon, ob an der Datenbank selbst aufgrund der Anordnung oder der Auswahl des Inhalts ein Urheberrecht entsteht. Die Aufnahme des Lizenzgegenstandes in eine Sammlung gilt nicht als Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes.
Eine „Abwandlung“ im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist jede Veränderung des Lizenzgegenstandes, insbesondere eine Umgestaltung, Bearbeitung, Änderung, Anpassung oder Übersetzung, solange der Lizenzgegenstand in seinem individuellen Charakter erkennbar bleibt. Nicht als Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes gilt seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung.
„Rechteinhaber“ ist der Urheber des Lizenzgegenstandes, der Inhaber verwandter Schutzrechte oder jede andere Person, die am Lizenzgegenstand Nutzungsrechte erlangt hat, welche die Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder die Weiterübertragung der Nutzungsrechte an Dritte erlauben.
Ein „Werk“ ist eine geistige Schöpfung mit individuellem Charakter.
Ein „verwandtes Schutzrecht“ ist ein Recht an einer kulturellen Leistung, welche nicht als Werk geschützt ist, wie etwa jene von ausübenden Künstlern, Herstellern von Ton- und Tonbildträgern oder Sendeunternehmen.
„Öffentlich Wiedergeben“ ist das Vortragen des Lizenzgegenstandes direkt oder mit irgendwelchen Mitteln, das Aufführen, das Vorführen, das anderswo Wahrnehmbarmachen oder das Zugänglichmachen in der Weise, dass Personen von Orten und zu Zeiten ihrer Wahl dazu Zugang haben.
„Vervielfältigen“ bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren vorübergehende oder dauerhafte Vervielfältigungsstücke des Lizenzgegenstandes herzustellen und umfasst auch den Vorgang der erstmaligen körperlichen Fixierungen des Lizenzgegenstandes und der Herstellung von Vervielfältigungen dieser Fixierungen sowie die Übertragung des Lizenzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleich ob in digitaler oder analoger Form.
„Verbreiten“ bedeutet, den Lizenzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
2. Schranken des Urheberrechts
Dieser Lizenzvertrag lässt sämtliche Befugnisse unberührt, die sich aufgrund der Beschränkungen der ausschliesslichen Rechte des Rechteinhabers durch das Urheberrechtsgesetz (Eigengebrauch, Erschöpfungsgrundsatz etc.) oder durch andere Bestimmungen der anwendbaren Gesetzgebung ergeben.
3. Lizenzierung
Unter den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber die Befugnis ein, den Lizenzgegenstand weltweit, lizenzgebührenfrei, nicht exklusiv und zeitlich unbeschränkt (d.h. für die Schutzdauer des Werks oder des verwandten Schutzrechts) wie folgt zu nutzen:
den Lizenzgegenstand zu vervielfältigen, ihn in eine oder mehrere Sammlungen aufzunehmen und ihn im Rahmen der Sammlung zu vervielfältigen;
den Lizenzgegenstand abzuwandeln, d.h. ihn zu bearbeiten oder in anderer Weise umzugestalten, einschliesslich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jeglicher Art von Medien anzufertigen, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um eine Abwandlung handelt;
den Lizenzgegenstand oder Vervielfältigungen davon zu verbreiten, öffentlich wiederzugeben, durch Radio, Fernsehen oder ähnliche Einrichtungen, auch über Leitungen, zu senden, weiterzusenden oder sonstwie wahrnehmbar zu machen, wobei sich diese Befugnisse auch auf den in eine Sammlung aufgenommenen Lizenzgegenstand erstrecken;
den abgewandelten, d.h. bearbeiteten oder umgestalteten Lizenzgegenstand zu vervielfältigen, verbreiten, öffentlich wiederzugeben, durch Radio, Fernsehen oder ähnliche Einrichtungen, auch über Leitungen, zu senden, weiterzusenden oder sonstwie wahrnehmbar zu machen.
bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche als Gegenleistung für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschliessliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen ausserhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.
Die vorstehend genannten Befugnisse können für alle Nutzungsarten sowie in jedem Medium und Format ausgeübt werden, ob diese bereits bekannt sind oder erst in Zukunft entwickelt werden. Diese Befugnisse umfassen auch das Recht zu Änderungen, die technisch notwendig sind, um die Befugnisse in anderen Medien und Formaten auszuüben.
4. Bedingungen
Die in Ziffer 3 eingeräumten Befugnisse unterliegen den folgenden Bedingungen:
Bei jeder Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz müssen Sie eine Kopie dieser Lizenz mitgeben. Sie können hiervon absehen, wenn Sie an Stelle dieser Lizenz die jedermann zugängliche Fundstelle dieser Lizenz bekannt geben (Uniform Resource Identifier, URI). Sie müssen bei der Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz alle Hinweise auf diese Lizenz und auf ihre Klauseln betreffend Gewährleistungs- und Haftungsausschluss beibehalten. Sie dürfen keine Vereinbarungen treffen, welche die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verschärfen oder die mit dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte für einen Dritten einschränken. Sie dürfen für den Lizenzgegenstand keine Unterlizenz erteilen. Sie dürfen den Lizenzgegenstand nicht mit technischen Schutzmassnahmen versehen, die den Nutzer des Lizenzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können.  Ziffer 4 Buchstabe a gilt auch, falls der Lizenzgegenstand Bestandteil einer Sammlung ist. Dies bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass die Sammlung als solche diesen Lizenzbestimmungen unterstellt werden muss.  Wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand in eine Sammlung aufnehmen, müssen Sie auf Aufforderung des Urhebers oder jedes Lizenzgebers hin jeden Hinweis auf den Auffordernden soweit machbar und gewünscht aus der Sammlung entfernen; soweit Hinweise gestützt auf eine solche Aufforderung zu entfernen sind, entfallen die Pflichten gemäss Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b. Entsprechendes gilt bei Abwandlungen.
Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstands oder einer Abwandlung davon, sei es isoliert oder als Teil einer Sammlung, müssen Sie die bestehenden Copyright-Vermerke vollständig beibehalten bzw. in einem Rahmen wiedergeben, der dem technischen Verfahren und dem Trägermedium der von Ihnen vorgenommenen Nutzung angemessen ist, ausgenommen, es liegt eine Aufforderung zur Entfernung der Angaben gemäss Ziffer 4 Buchstabe a Absatz 3 vor.
Insbesondere müssen Sie (i) den Namen (oder das Pseudonym) des Urhebers sowie den Namen von Dritten nennen, die ein Rechteinhaber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen hat.
Ist Ihnen (ii) der Titel des Lizenzgegenstands bekannt, müssen Sie diesen angeben.
Hat der Lizenzgeber (iii) eine Internetadresse angegeben (z.B. in Form des Uniform Resource Identifier, URI), welche Lizenzinformationen oder Copyright-Vermerke enthält, müssen Sie diese ebenfalls nennen, soweit dies mit angemessenem Aufwand durchführbar ist.
Bei Abwandlungen müssen Sie (iv) einen mit Ziffer 3 Buchstabe b in Einklang stehenden Hinweis darauf anführen, in welcher Form der Lizenzgegenstand in die Abwandlung eingegangen ist (z. B. „Französische Übersetzung des … (Werk) durch … (Urheber)“ oder „Das Drehbuch beruht auf dem Werk des … (Urheber)“).
Die gemäss dieser Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b vorgeschriebenen Hinweise können in jeder angemessenen Weise erfolgen. Bei Abwandlungen oder Sammlungen müssen solche Hinweise hinsichtlich Plazierung und Ausgestaltung mindestens ebenso auffällig und in vergleichbarer Weise ausgeführt werden, wie dies für die anderen Rechteinhaber erfolgte, sofern ein solcher Hinweis für alle beitragenden Lizenzgeber erscheint.  Zur Klarstellung: Die gemäss dieser Ziffer 4 Buchstabe b vorgeschriebenen Hinweise dürfen ausschliesslich in der in diesem Abschnitt beschriebenen Weise und zum Zweck der Zurechnung des Werks zum Urheber, Lizenzgeber bzw. zu Dritten, die ein Urheber bzw. Lizenzgeber in den Copyright-Vermerk aufgenommen hat, verwendet werden. Bei der Nutzung des Lizenzgegenstandes dürfen Sie weder implizit noch explizit den Eindruck einer Unterstützung oder Billigung durch diese Personen oder den Eindruck einer sonstigen Verbindung zwischen Ihnen und diesen Personen erwecken, ohne zuvor eine separate schriftliche Einwilligung von den betroffenen Personen eingeholt zu haben.
Ihre Befugnis, den Lizenzgegenstand zu nutzen, findet ihre gesetzliche Grenze in den (Urheber-) Persönlichkeitsrechten des Rechteinhabers, dessen berechtigte geistige und persönliche Interessen bzw. dessen Ansehen oder Ruf durch die Nutzung ohne eine zuvor eingeholte separate schriftliche Einwilligung der betroffenen Personen nicht beeinträchtigt werden dürfen.
5. Keine Gewährleistung
SOFERN VOM LIZENZGEBER NICHT SCHRIFTLICH ANDERS ANERKANNT, ÜBERNIMMT DER LIZENZGEBER KEINE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG FÜR DIE ERTEILTEN BEFUGNISSE.
6. Haftungsausschluss
ÜBER DIE IN ZIFFER 5 GENANNTE GEWÄHRLEISTUNG HINAUS HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER NUR FÜR VORSATZ UND GROBE FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT. JEDE ANDERE HAFTUNG IST AUSGESCHLOSSEN, SOWEIT GESETZLICH ZULÄSSIG. FÜR SEINE HILFSPERSONEN HAFTET DER LIZENZGEBER IN KEINEM FALL. DIESER HAFTUNGSAUSSCHLUSS GILT AUCH DANN, WENN SIE AUF DIE MÖGLICHKEIT EINER SCHÄDIGUNG HINGEWIESEN HABEN.
7. Beendigung
Diese Lizenz und die darunter eingeräumten Befugnisse fallen ohne weiteres und mit sofortiger Wirkung dahin, wenn Sie die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verletzen. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Lizenzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammlungen unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 und 8 bleiben ungeachtet der Beendigung dieser Lizenz verbindlich.
Die mit dieser Lizenz eingeräumten Befugnisse werden zeitlich uneingeschränkt eingeräumt (freilich höchstens für die Dauer, für welche der Lizenzgegenstand nach dem anwendbaren Recht urheber- bzw. leistungsschutzrechtlich geschützt ist). Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch für einen beliebigen Zeitpunkt das Recht vor, den Lizenzgegenstand unter einer anderen Lizenz weiterzugeben oder die Verbreitung des Lizenzgegenstands ganz zu beenden. Der Lizenzwechsel wird jedoch nicht die Wirkung eines Widerrufs dieser Lizenz haben (oder jeder anderen Lizenzierung, die auf der Grundlage dieser Lizenz erfolgt oder erfolgen muss), vielmehr wird die Lizenz so lange weiter bestehen, als sie nicht nach Ziffer 7 Buchstabe a vorstehend beendigt wurde.
8. Verschiedenes
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie den Lizenzgegenstand oder eine Sammlung gestützt auf Ziffer 3 dieser Lizenz nutzen, räumt der Lizenzgeber auch dem Empfänger eines allfälligen Vervielfältigungsstücks eine Lizenz am Lizenzgegenstand selber ein, und zwar zu denselben Bedingungen wie die Ihnen eingeräumte Lizenz.
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Lizenzgegenstandes gestützt auf Ziffer 3 dieser Lizenz nutzen, räumt der Lizenzgeber auch dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Lizenzgegenstand an, und zwar zu denselben Bedingungen wie die Ihnen eingeräumte Lizenz.
Sollten sich einzelne Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz nach dem anwendbaren Recht als nicht durchsetzbar oder nichtig erweisen, so bleiben die übrigen Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz gültig und durchsetzbar und an die Stelle der unwirksamen Bestimmung tritt eine Ersatzregelung, die dem mit der unwirksamen Bestimmung angestrebten Zweck am nächsten kommt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz gilt als wegbedungen und keine Verletzung als genehmigt, bevor nicht die durch die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung belastete Partei die Wegbedingung oder Genehmigung in Schriftform und unterschriftlich bestätigt hat.
Diese Lizenz enthält alle mit Blick auf den Lizenzgegenstand zwischen den Parteien massgeblichen Bestimmungen. Andere Vertrauenspositionen, Abreden oder Zusicherungen im Hinblick auf den Lizenzgegenstand bestehen nicht. Der Lizenzgeber ist durch keine zusätzliche Klausel gebunden, welche sich aus irgendwelchen Unterlagen von Ihnen ergibt. Diese Vereinbarung kann ohne vorherige Vereinbarung mit unterschriftlicher Bestätigung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen nicht abgeändert werden.
Creative Commons Hinweis
Creative Commons ist nicht Partei dieses Lizenzvertrags und macht keinerlei Zusicherungen mit Blick auf den Lizenzgegenstand. Creative Commons haftet nicht für Ihnen entstandene Schäden aus der Verwendung des Lizenzgegenstands oder dieser Lizenz, aus welchem Rechtsgrund sie auch abgeleitet werden, sei es für direkten, indirekten Schaden oder für Folgeschaden. Ungeachtet des vorstehenden Satzes hat Creative Commons alle Rechte aus dieser Lizenz, sofern sie bezüglich eines Werks ausdrücklich selber als Lizenzgeberin unter dieser Lizenz auftritt.
Ausser für den begrenzten Zweck, dem Publikum öffentlich bekannt zu machen, dass der Lizenzgegenstand unter der CCPL lizenziert ist, erlaubt Creative Commons den Parteien dieser Lizenz nicht, das Markenzeichen "Creative Commons" oder irgend ein anderes Markenzeichen oder Logo von Creative Commons ohne die vorgängige schriftliche Zustimmung von Creative Commons zu verwenden.

LA SOCIÉTÉ CREATIVE COMMONS N'EST PAS UNE ÉTUDE D'AVOCATS ET NE FOURNIT PAS DE CONSEILS OU DE SERVICES JURIDIQUES. LA DISTRIBUTION DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE NE CRÉE AUCUN MANDAT ENTRE SON UTILISATEUR ET CREATIVE COMMONS. CREATIVE COMMONS LIVRE CES INFORMATION « TEL QUEL » ET NE FOURNIT AUCUNE GARANTIE EN RELATION AVEC CETTE LICENCE ET LES INFORMATIONS QU’ELLE CONTIENT ET SE DÉCHARGE DE TOUTE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR TOUT DOMMAGE POUVANT RÉSULTER DE SON UTILISATION.

Licence
En exerçant l’un des droits concernés par cette licence, Vous acceptez que les termes de la présente licence soient juridiquement contraignantes. Pour autant que la présente licence puisse être considérée comme un contrat, le donneur de licence Vous autorise à utiliser sans contrepartie les droits figurant dans cette licence à condition que vous acceptiez de Vous conformer strictement à ses termes.
Le « Donneur de licence », à savoir la personne qui met l’Objet de la Licence à disposition aux conditions qu’elle contient,  et  « Vous », à savoir la personne physique ou morale, qui utilisez, au sens de l’article 3 de la présente Licence, l’Objet de la Licence conformément aux termes de la présente Licence acceptez, sous réserve d’une autorisation expresse du Donneur de licence de Vous en écarter, de Vous conformer strictement aux conditions d’utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence contenues dans la présente Licence indépendamment de toute utilisation contraire qui aurait pu en être faite par le passé :
1. Définitions
L’ « Objet de la licence » peut être une Œuvre protégée par le droit d’auteur ou une prestation protégée par des droits voisins.
Un « Recueil » au sens de la présente Licence est une compilation de l’Objet de la licence avec d'autres œuvres ou d'autres éléments, indépendamment du fait que le Recueil en tant que tel jouisse d’un droit d’auteur en raison du choix ou de la disposition de son contenu. Par « Recueil », il faut entendre les bases de données, indépendamment du fait qu’elles jouissent d’un droit d’auteur en raison du choix ou de la disposition de leur contenu. Le fait d’incorporer l’Objet de la licence dans un Recueil n’équivaut pas à une Modification de l'Objet de licence.
Une « Modification » au sens de la présente Licence signifie tout changement de l’Objet de la licence, en particulier, toute transformation, œuvre dérivée, modification, adaptation ou traduction, aussi longtemps que le caractère unique de l’Objet de licence demeure reconnaissable. Le fait d’incorporer l’Object de la licence dans un Recueil n’équivaut pas à une Modification.
« Titulaire des droits » comprend l'auteur de l’Objet de la licence, les titulaires de droits voisins, ou toute autre personne ayant acquis des droits en relation avec l’Objet de la licence et qui est autorisée à accorder des licences ou sous-licences à des tiers.
Une « Œuvre » est une création de l’esprit, littéraire ou artistique, qui a un caractère individuel.
Un « Droit voisin » est un droit relatif à une prestation culturelle, qui n'est pas protégé en tant qu'Œuvre, tels que ceux des artistes interprètes, producteurs de phonogrammes et de vidéogrammes et des organismes de radiodiffusion.
« Représentation publique » est la représentation, la récitation, la projection ou la mise à disposition de l’Objet de la licence directement ou par tout autre moyen permettant aux personnes présentes en un lieu et à un moment donné d’y avoir accès.
« Reproduire » signifie une reproduction de l’Objet de la licence en utilisant n'importe quel moyen de reproduction temporaire ou permanent, y compris l'exploitation de la première fixation physique de l'Objet de la licence et la production de copies de cette fixation ainsi que le transfert de l’Objet de la licence sur tout support visuel ou sonore ou tout autre support électronique, que ce soit sous forme numérique ou analogique.
« Diffuser » signifie mettre à disposition du public ou mettre en circulation l’Objet de la licence ou des Modifications sous forme originale ou sous forme de reproductions physiques.
2. Restrictions du droit d’auteur
La présente Licence n’a pas pour effet de limiter les droits découlant des restrictions au droit d'auteur (utilisation à des fins privées, principe de l'épuisement, etc.) ou d'autres lois applicables.
3. Licences
En vertu des termes de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence Vous accorde le droit non exclusif d’utiliser l’Objet de la licence dans le monde entier, libre de redevance, pour une durée indéterminée (pour la durée de la protection de l’Œuvre par le droit d’auteur ou les droits voisins) comme suit :
Reproduire l’Objet de la Licence, l’incorporer dans un Recueil et le reproduire une fois incorporé dans le Recueil.
Modifier l’Objet de la licence, c’est-à-dire en faire des œuvres dérivées, des traductions ou le transformer d’une autre manière en utilisant n'importe quel type de média, aussi longtemps qu’il est clairement indiqué qu’il s’agit d’une Modification.
Diffuser ou rendre accessible au public l’Objet de la licence ou des copies de celui-ci, que ce soit par le biais de la radio, la télévision ou de toute installation similaire, y compris par le câble, permettant de le diffuser, de le rediffuser ou de le rendre perceptible de toute autre manière, étant précisé que ces prérogatives s'étendent aux Recueils lorsque l’Objet de la licence y est incorporé.
Reproduire, diffuser ou rendre accessible au public les Modifications de l’Objet de la Licence, que ce soit par le biais de la radio, la télévision ou de toute installation similaire, y compris par le câble, permettant de le diffuser, de le rediffuser ou de le rendre perceptible de toute autre manière.
La rémunération pour l'utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence est soumise aux principes suivants :
Système de rémunération légale obligatoire : dans les cas où il existe un système de rémunération légale obligatoire en échange de licences légales ou un système de redevance forfaitaire (par exemple, pour les supports vierges), le Donneur de licence se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances pour chacune des utilisations que Vous faites d’un droit faisant l’objet de cette Licence ;
Système de rémunération lié à l’octroi de licences obligatoires : dans les cas où des licences obligatoires n’étant pas comprises dans cette Licence entrent en considération, le Donneur de licence renonce à toute rémunération pour toute utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence que Vous seriez amené à faire en vertu d’une licence obligatoire ;
Autres cas de rémunération : le Donneur de licence renonce à toute rémunération pour toute utilisation de l’Objet de la Licence conformément aux termes de celle-ci et qui ne tombe pas sous le coup des deux sections précédentes (i) et (ii), indépendamment du fait que la collecte des droits d’auteur puisse se faire par le Donneur de licence lui-même ou doive impérativement passer par une société de gestion.
Les prérogatives figurant ci-dessus valent pour tous types d'utilisation et tous types de médias ou de formats connus ou futurs. Ces prérogatives comprennent le droit d'apporter des modifications qui sont techniquement nécessaires pour pouvoir les exercer sur d’autres supports ou dans d’autres formats.
4. Conditions
Les autorisations accordées au chiffre 3 ci-dessus sont soumises aux conditions suivantes :
Pour chaque exercice d’un droit conféré par cette Licence, Vous devez remettre une copie de cette Licence. Vous pouvez y renoncer si Vous la rendez accessible à quiconque sous la forme d’un « Uniform Resource Identifier » (ci-après : « URI »). Lorsque Vous exercez un droit en vertu de la présente Licence, Vous devez maintenir toutes les références à cette Licence et aux clauses d’exclusion de garantie et de responsabilité. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à conclure un accord qui durcirait les conditions de la présente Licence ou qui soumettrait les droits garantis par cette Licence à des restrictions vis-à-vis des tiers. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à accorder des sous-licences en relation avec l’Objet de la Licence. Vous n’êtes pas habilité à soumettre l’Objet de la Licence à des mesures de protection techniques qui empêcheraient ses utilisateurs d’exercer les droits garantis par la présente Licence.  La présente disposition (article 4 let. a) s’applique également dans les cas où l’Objet de la Licence est incorporé à un Recueil, indépendamment du fait que ledit Recueil soit en tant que tel soumis aux conditions de la présente Licence.  Lorsque Vous incorporez l’Objet de la Licence dans un Recueil, Vous devez, à la requête du Titulaire des droits ou de tout Donneur de licence et dans la mesure du possible, retirer du Recueil toute référence au requérant ; dès lors que les références sont retirées sur la base d’une telle requête, les obligations de l’article 4 let. b sont applicables. La même obligation vaut pour les Modifications.
Pour chaque diffusion, mise à disposition du public de l’Objet de la Licence ou de Modifications, que ce soit de manière individuelle ou dans le cadre d’un Recueil, Vous devez, à moins qu’une requête au sens de l’article 4 let. a ne Vous ait été adressée, faire en sorte que toutes les mentions légales relatives au droit d’auteur en relation avec l’Objet de la Licence demeurent intactes et faire en sorte, dans les limites des moyens techniques et des supports que Vous utilisez, que les indications suivantes figurent dans la mention légale relative au droit d’auteur :
Nom de l’auteur original (ou, le cas échéant, son pseudonyme) ou le nom de tiers figurant dans la mention légale initiale ;
Le titre de l’Œuvre, pour autant qu’il Vous soit connu ;
L’adresse internet (par exemple sous la forme d’Uniform Resource Identifier, URI) qui contient les informations relatives à la Licence ou la mention légale relative au droit d’auteur pour autant que cela puisse raisonnablement être mis en œuvre ;
Pour les Modifications, une mention légale conforme à l’article 3 let. b permettant d’identifier l’utilisation de l’œuvre faite dans le cadre de la Modification (par exemple : « Traduction française de … (Œuvre) par … (auteur) » ou « scénario basé sur l’œuvre originale de … (auteur original) »).
Les mentions légales requises par l’article 4 let. b peuvent être indiquées de toute manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas de Modifications ou de Recueils, s’il figure une mention légale pour tous les auteurs ayant contribué à la Modification ou au Recueil, alors la mention légale pour chacun des auteurs doit être au minimum d’une importance comparable à celle des autres auteurs ayant participé à la Modification ou au Recueil.  Pour clarification : les mentions légales requises par cet article 4 let. b ne peuvent être utilisées que pour attribuer la paternité de l’Œuvre conformément aux obligations contenues dans la présente Licence, et, en exerçant Vos droits dans le cadre de la présente Licence, Vous n’êtes pas autorisé à prétendre de manière directe ou indirecte ou à laisser penser qu’il existe un parrainage entre Vous et l’auteur original, le Donneur de licence et/ou les auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre avec Vous ou que l’auteur original, le Donneur de licence et/ou les auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre avec Vous approuvent votre travail ou l’utilisation que Vous faites de l’Œuvre sans autorisation séparée, expresse et préalable de l’auteur original, du Donneur de licence ou des auteurs ayant contribué à l’Œuvre.
Votre possibilité d’utiliser l’Objet de la Licence trouve ses limites dans les droits de la personnalité et les droits moraux du Titulaire des droits, lequel a le droit à ce que son intégrité intellectuelle et personnelle, ainsi que son honneur et sa réputation ne soient pas atteints sans une autorisation écrite préalable séparée.
5. Exclusion de garantie
A MOINS D’UN ENGAGEMENT ÉCRIT CONTRAIRE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE DONNE AUCUNE GARANTIE EN RELATION AVEC LES PRÉROGATIVES ACCORDÉES EN VERTU DE LA PRÉSENTE LICENCE.
6. Limitation de responsabilité
LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE RÉPOND QUE DES DOMMAGES INTENTIONNELS OU RÉSULTANT DE SA NÉGLIGENCE GRAVE EN RELATION AVEC LES GARANTIES DONNÉES EN VERTU DE L’ARTICLE 5. TOUTE AUTRE RESPONSABILITÉ DU DONNEUR DE LICENCE EST EXCLUE, POUR AUTANT QUE CELA SOIT LICITE. LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE RÉPOND EN AUCUN CAS DE SES AUXILIAIRES. LA PRÉSENTE EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ EST ÉGALEMENT APPLICABLE DANS LES CAS OÙ VOUS AURIEZ ÉTÉ AVISÉ DE LA POSSIBILITÉ D’UN DÉDOMMAGEMENT.
7. Résiliation
Cette Licence - et les droits qu’elle contient – prendra fin automatiquement et avec effet immédiat en cas de violation de l’un de ses termes. Les personnes physiques et morales qui ont reçu des Modifications ou des Recueils de votre part sur la base de cette Licence pourront néanmoins continuer à les utiliser sur la base de leurs licences, pour autant, toutefois, que ces personnes physiques ou morales se conforment strictement aux termes de ces licences. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 resteront en vigueur en cas de résiliation de cette Licence.
Les droits accordés par la présente Licence sont accordés pour une durée indéterminée (pour la durée de protection de l’Objet de la Licence en vertu du droit applicable en matière de droit d’auteur ou de droits voisins) aux conditions contenues dans la présente Licence. Nonobstant ce qui précède, le droit du Donneur de licence de publier l’Œuvre sous d’autres termes contractuels ou d’arrêter de diffuser l’Œuvre à tout moment est réservé, à condition, toutefois, que cette décision n’ait pas pour effet d’annuler la présente Licence (ou toute licence qui a été, ou qui doit être accordée sur la base de cette Licence), étant précisé que dans ce cas de figure la présente Licence restera en vigueur jusqu’à sa résiliation conformément à ce qui précède.
8. Divers
Chaque fois que Vous utilisez l’Objet de la Licence ou un Recueil conformément à l’article 3 de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence accorde au destinataire de l’Objet de la Licence ou du Recueil une licence semblable à celle-ci, aux mêmes conditions, valant pour l’utilisation de l’Œuvre.
Chaque fois que Vous utilisez une Modification de l’Objet de la Licence sur la base de l’article 3 de la présente Licence, le Donneur de licence accorde au destinataire de la Modification une licence semblable à celle-ci, aux mêmes conditions, valant pour l’utilisation de l’œuvre originale.
Dans l’hypothèse où une disposition contenue dans la présente Licence devait être considérée comme nulle ou ne pourrait être exécutée en vertu du droit applicable, les autres dispositions de la présente Licence demeureraient pleinement valables et exécutoires et la disposition inefficace devrait être remplacée par une disposition conforme au but recherché par la présente Licence.
Aucune renonciation des termes ou dispositions de la présente Licence ne pourra être acceptée et aucune violation ne pourra être consentie sans l’accord écrit et signé par la partie concernée par cette renonciation ou ce consentement.
La présente Licence constitue le seul accord entre les parties à propos de l’Objet de la Licence. Il n'existe aucun accord ou garantie portant sur l’Objet de la Licence en dehors des éléments mentionnés ici. Le Donneur de licence ne sera tenu par aucune disposition complémentaire qui pourrait figurer dans une communication de Votre part. Cette Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord mutuel écrit des Parties.
Note Creative Commons
Creative Commons n'est pas partie à la présente Licence et ne donne aucune garantie quant à l’Objet sous Licence. Creative Commons ne peut être tenue responsable envers Vous ou toute partie sur la base d’aucune théorie juridique pour tout dommage, que ce soit pour des dommages directs, des indirects ou consécutifs survenus en relation avec cette Licence. Nonobstant les deux (2) phrases précédentes, si Creative Commons a expressément reconnu agir comme Donneur de Licence, elle répondra vis-à-vis de Vous de la même manière que le Donneur de Licence.

Los créditos o menciones solicitados por esta Sección 4(b) pueden ser implementados de cualquier forma razonable; Sin embargo, si en una Adaptación o una Colección aparecen mencionados los autores que contribuyeron a formarla, como mínimo el crédito de esta Sección 4(b) deberá aparecer incluido como parte de dicha mención y de forma tan destacada como los créditos de quienes han contribuido.

在发行或公开传播本作品、任何演绎作品或汇编作品时，除非有依据第四条第1项之要求，否则您必须完整保留所有关于本作品的著作权声明，并以适于所使用的媒介或方法的形式提供下述信息：（1）在原始作者的姓名（或笔名）已被提供的情况下，给出该姓名或笔名，或者在原始作者或许可人以许可人的著作权声明或其他合理的方式，指定可以在作品上署名的他方当事人姓名的情况下，指明该他方当事人的名称（“署名人”）；（2）在本作品标题已被提供的情况下，给出本作品的标题；（3）在合理可行的范围内，标明许可人指定需与本作品同时出现的网址，除非该网址没有涉及到本作品的著作权声明或者关于本作品的许可信息；（4）若为演绎作品，则依第三条第2项之要求，必须注明演绎作品中使用的本作品的作者姓名和作品名称（例如，“某作者作品的法语译本”，或“基于某作者作品的电影剧本”）。本项（第四条第2项）要求的对作者姓名和作品名称的指明可采取任何合理方式，但在演绎作品或汇编作品中，如果已经指明了演绎作品的所有作者或汇编作品中所有内含作品的作者，那么对本作品名称和作者姓名的指明须同时出现在任何其他作者姓名出现的地方，并至少与对其他作者的指明一样显著。为避免疑义，本条有关标示作者姓名和作品名称之规定，仅适用于前述署名的用途；除非您事先另行取得原始作者、许可人或署名人的书面同意，否则您不得以明示或者默示的方式主张或暗示，您本人或您对作品的使用与原始作者、许可人或署名人有关联或者已获得上述人士的赞助或者支持。
除非其他法律法规另有规定，您在复制、发行或者公开表演本作品，或者复制、发行或者公开表演作为任何演绎作品或汇编作品一部分的本作品时，不得歪曲、损害或者以其他方式损害本作品，导致原始作者的名誉或者荣誉受损。
第五条 声明、保证和免责
除非本许可的当事人相互以书面的方式做出相反约定，且在相关法律所允许的最大范围内，否则许可人按其现状提供本作品，对本作品不作任何明示或者默示、依照法律或者其他规定的陈述或担保，包括但是不限于任何有关可否商业性使用、是否符合特定的目的、不具有潜在的或者其他缺陷、准确性或者不存在不论能否被发现的错误的担保。有些司法管辖区不允许排除前述默示保证，因此这些排除性规定并不一定适用于您。
第六条 责任限制
除非属于相关法律所要求的范围，许可人在任何情况下都不对您因本许可或因使用本作品而产生的任何直接损失、间接损失或惩罚性赔偿负责，即使许可人已被告知发生此类损害的可能性。
第七条 许可终止
在您违反本许可协议任何条款时，本许可及其所授予的权利将自动终止。然而，根据本许可从您处获取演绎作品或汇编作品的自然人、法人或者其他组织，如果他们仍完全遵守相关条款，则对他们的许可不会随之终止。即使本许可被终止，第一条、第二条、第五条、第六条、第七条以及第八条仍然有效。
在上述条款及条件的前提下，此处授予的许可在法定著作权保护期限内有效。即便如此，许可人保留依其他许可条款发行本作品及在任何时候停止发行本作品的权利；但是，许可人的上述权利不能被用于撤销本许可或任何其他在本许可条款下授予的或必须授予的许可，除本条第1项指明的终止外，本许可将保持其完全效力。
第八条 其他事项
当您发行、公开传播本作品或其汇编作品时，许可人给获得作品的第三方提供本作品的许可，其条款和条件与您所获得的许可相同。

DER SCHUTZGEGENSTAND IST DURCH DAS URHEBERRECHT UND/ODER ANDERE GESETZE GESCHÜTZT. JEDE FORM DER NUTZUNG DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, DIE NICHT AUFGRUND DIESER LIZENZ ODER DURCH GESETZE GESTATTET IST, IST UNZULÄSSIG.
DURCH DIE AUSÜBUNG EINES DURCH DIESE LIZENZ GEWÄHRTEN RECHTS AN DEM SCHUTZGEGENSTAND ERKLÄREN SIE SICH MIT DEN LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN RECHTSVERBINDLICH EINVERSTANDEN. SOWEIT DIESE LIZENZ ALS LIZENZVERTRAG ANZUSEHEN IST, GEWÄHRT IHNEN DER LIZENZGEBER DIE IN DER LIZENZ GENANNTEN RECHTE UNENTGELTLICH UND IM AUSTAUSCH DAFÜR, DASS SIE DAS GEBUNDENSEIN AN DIE LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN AKZEPTIEREN.
1. Definitionen
Der Begriff "Abwandlung" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes.
Der Begriff "Sammelwerk" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht.
"Verbreiten" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen.
Der "Lizenzgeber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt.
"Rechteinhaber" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist.
Der Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff "Schutzgegenstand" im Sinne dieser Lizenz.
Mit "Sie" bzw. "Ihnen" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben.
Unter "Öffentlich Zeigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet.
"Vervielfältigen" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form.
2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts
Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben.
3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten
Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.e) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ("unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann"):
Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen;
Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes anzufertigen, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jedweder Medien, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um Abwandlungen handelt;
den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten;
Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten.
Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes:
Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie.
Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung.
Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre.
Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte.
4. Bedingungen
Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen:
Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.b) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Abwandlung vornehmen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Abwandlung die in Abschnitt 4.b) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen.
Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Abwandlungen oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben:  
Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ("Zuschreibungsempfänger"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten;
den Titel des Inhaltes;
in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand;
und im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine Abwandlung handelt.
Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.b) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten.
Die oben unter 4.a) und b) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen.
Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt.
5. Gewährleistung
SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT, SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT.
6. Haftungsbeschränkung
DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR, SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG.
7. Erlöschen
Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort.
Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt.
8. Sonstige Bestimmungen
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Jedes Mal, wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz.
Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen davon unberührt.
Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat.
Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß Ziffern 8.a) und b) angebotenen Lizenzen aus.
Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung.

Para evitar cualquier duda, en los casos en los cuales la Obra sea una obra musical, ejecución o grabación musical, la sincronización de la obra de una forma cronometrada con una imagen en movimiento (“sincronización”) será considerada una Obra Derivada para los propósitos de esta Licencia.

Un trabajo que constituye una Colección no será considerada una Obra Derivada (tal como se define anteriormente) para los propósitos de esta Licencia.
“Distribución” Poner a disposición del público, el original o copias de la Obra, mediante su venta, arrendamiento, préstamo público o de cualquier otra forma conocida o por conocerse de transferencia de la propiedad, posesión o tenencia de dicho original o copia.
“Licenciante” Significa el individuo, los individuos, la entidad o las entidades, titular o titulares de los Derechos de Autor, que ofrecen la Obra según las estipulaciones de esta Licencia.
“Autor” Es la persona natural que realiza la creación intelectual. Para los efectos de esta Licencia el Autor también debe entenderse como el artista, intérprete o ejecutante; el productor de un fonograma y el titular de radiodifusión en el sentido de los Derechos Conexos.
“Obra” Es toda creación intelectual original, de naturaleza artística, científica, o literaria, susceptible de ser divulgada o reproducida en cualquier forma conocida o por conocerse. Para los efectos de esta Licencia “Obra” también debe entenderse como una interpretación o ejecución, una emisión, un fonograma en el sentido de los Derechos Conexos de acuerdo con la Ley de Derechos de Autor, en la medida en que la interpretación o ejecución, la emisión o el fonograma estén protegidos por la ley aplicable.
“Licenciatario” Persona natural o jurídica que ejerce sus derechos según esta Licencia y que no ha infringido previamente las condiciones de la misma con respecto a la Obra. O quien ha recibido un permiso expreso por parte del Licenciante para ejercer sus derechos según esta Licencia, a pesar de dicho incumplimiento previo.

2. Usos Honrados.- Ninguna estipulación contenida en esta Licencia podrá ser interpretada como una disminución, limitación o restricción de los derechos derivados del uso honrado y otras limitaciones o excepciones a los Derechos de Autor bajo el régimen legal vigente o derivado de cualquier otra norma aplicable.
3. Concesión de la Licencia.- Sujeto a los términos y a las condiciones de esta Licencia, el Licenciante otorga al Licenciatario una Licencia mundial, sin cobro de regalías, no exclusiva e indefinida (depende del acuerdo de los contratantes de la Licencia), para ejercer los derechos de Licenciatario de la Obra, tal como se estipulan a continuación:
Reproducir la Obra, e incorporarla en una o más Colecciones, y a reproducir la Obra tal como se incorpora en las Colecciones;
A crear y reproducir Obras Derivadas siempre y cuando dicha Obra Derivada, incluyendo cualquier traducción en cualquier medio, efectúe los pasos razonables para claramente colocar etiquetas, demarcar, o identificar de alguna otra manera los cambios que se realizaron en la Obra original. Por ejemplo, una traducción debe marcarse como “El trabajo original fue traducido de inglés a español”, o una modificación deberá indicar “El trabajo original fue modificado”;
A distribuir y ejecutar públicamente la Obra incluyendo aquella cuando se incorpora en Colecciones; y,
A distribuir y ejecutar públicamente Obras Derivadas.
Para evitar todas las dudas, el Licenciante renuncia al derecho de recaudar regalías, sea individualmente o en el caso en que el Licenciante sea miembro de una sociedad de recaudaciones que maneje esquemas de Licencias voluntarias, mediante dicha sociedad, cuando el Licenciatario ejerza cualquier derecho otorgado según esta Licencia.
Se podrán ejercer dichos derechos en todos los formatos y medios, sean conocidos ahora o se conozcan en el futuro. Los derechos anteriores incluyen el derecho a realizar dichas modificaciones que sean técnicamente necesarias para ejercer los derechos en otros medios y formatos. Todos los derechos no cedidos expresamente por el Licenciante quedan reservados.
4. Restricciones.- La Licencia otorgada en la Sección 3 se sujeta expresamente y se limita según las siguientes restricciones:
El Licenciatario podrá distribuir o ejecutar públicamente la Obra solamente según las condiciones de esta Licencia. Deberá incluir una copia del Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI, por su sigla en inglés) para esta Licencia con cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente. El Licenciatario no podrá ofrecer ni imponer ninguna condición en la Obra que pueda restringir los términos de esta Licencia ni la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra para ejercer los derechos otorgados según las condiciones de esta Licencia. No podrá otorgar sub-licencias de la Obra. Deberá mantener sin modificaciones todas las notificaciones que se refieren a esta Licencia y a los descargos de responsabilidades con cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente. Cuando el Licenciatario distribuya o ejecute públicamente la Obra, el Licenciatario no podrá imponer ninguna medida tecnológica vigente en la Obra que pueda restringir la capacidad de la parte que recibe la Obra por parte del Licenciatario para ejercer los derechos otorgados al receptor, según las condiciones de esta Licencia. Se aplica esta Sección 4(a) a la Obra tal como se incorpora en una Colección, pero para esto no hace falta que la Colección, aparte de la Obra en sí, esté sujeta a las condiciones de esta Licencia. Si el Licenciatario es Autor de una Colección, cuando reciba la notificación de cualquier Licenciante, el Licenciatario debe; en la medida en que sea práctico, retirar de la Colección cualquier crédito tal como se requiere de acuerdo con la Sección 4(b), según se solicite. Si el Licenciatario crea una Obra Derivada, cuando reciba la notificación de cualquier Licenciante, el Licenciatario debe; en la medida en que sea práctico, retirar de la Obra Derivada cualquier crédito tal como se requiere de acuerdo a la Sección 4(b), según se solicite.
Si el Licenciatario distribuye o ejecuta públicamente la Obra o cualquier Obra Derivada o Colección, el Licenciatario debe, excepto si se ha presentado una solicitud según la Sección 4(a), mantener intactas todas las notificaciones de Derechos de Autor de la Obra e incluir, de forma razonable, dependiendo del medio o forma que el Licenciatario está usando: (i) el nombre del Autor (o seudónimo, si fuera aplicable) si fuera suministrado el nombre de dicha parte o partes, y/o si el Autor y/o el Licenciante designaran cualquier otra parte o partes (por ejemplo, un instituto auspiciante, una entidad de publicación, una revista) para el reconocimiento (las “Partes del Reconocimiento”) en la notificación de Derechos de Autor o condiciones del servicio del Licenciante o por otros medios razonables; (ii) el título de la Obra si fuera suministrado; (iii) en la medida en que fuera práctico, el Identificador de Recursos Uniforme (URI) si lo hubiere, que el Licenciante especifique que está asociado con la Obra; excepto si dicho URI no se refiere a la notificación del Derecho de Autor ni a la información de Licencias para la Obra; y, (iv) en forma coherente con la Sección 3(b), en el caso de una Obra Derivada, un crédito que identifique el uso de la Obra en la Obra Derivada (por ejemplo, “Traducción al francés del Trabajo por el Autor”, o “Guión basado en el Trabajo original por el Autor”). Se podrá implementar el crédito requerido por esta Sección 4(b) en cualquier forma razonable; siempre y cuando, en el caso de una Obra Derivada o Colección, por lo menos, aparecerá dicho crédito, si aparece un crédito de todos los autores que contribuyeron a la Obra Derivada o a la Colección, como una parte de estos créditos y de una forma, por lo menos, tan destacada como los créditos de los demás autores que contribuyeron.

يتمّ تقديم المصنف/العمل ( كما هو وارد أدناه ) بموجب بنود هذا الترخيص العام الخاص بمنظمة المشاع الإبداعي (Creative Commons) ("CCPL" أو"الترخيص"). ويكون المصنف محميًّاً بموجب حق المؤلف و/أو أي قانون آخر معمول به. يُمنع استخدام المصنف بخلاف ما هو مسموح به بموجب هذا الترخيص و/أو أي قانون آخر معمول به بموجب قوانين حماية الملكية الفكرية المصرية.
وبمجرد ممارسة أي حقوق تنشأ عن الترخيص، فإن المرخَّص له يقبل ويوافق على الالتزام ببنود هذا الترخيص. يمنح المُرَخِّص المرخَّص له الحقوق الواردة في هذا الترخيص لقاء قبول المرخَّص له لهذه البنود والشروط بما لا يتعارض مع النظام العام.
1) التعريفات:
أ) "المصنف المشتق": عبارة عن عمل مبتكر يستند إلى المصنف، أو مصنفات أخرى، مثل الترجمة أو الاقتباس أو مصنف مشتق أو مصنف موسيقي أو غيرها من التعديلات التي قد تقع على مصنف أدبي أو فني أو تسجيل صوتي أو أداء، ويشتمل على الاقتباسات السينمائية أو أي شكل آخر يمكن فيه تحويل المصنف أو اقتباسه، فيما عدا المصنف الذي يشكِّل مجموعة مصنفات/أعمال والذي لا يعتبر مصنفًا مشتقًا لغرض هذا الترخيص. يعتبر تزامن المصنف مع صورة متحركة مصنفا مشتقا في حالة المصنفات الموسيقية أو التسجيلات الصوتية.
ب) "مجموعة المصنفات/الأعمال": عبارة عن مجموعة من المصنفات الأدبية أو الفنية كالموسوعات والمقتطفات الأدبية المختارة أو الأداء أو التسجيلات الصوتية أو البرامج الإذاعية أو غيرها من المصنفات أو الأعمال غير المصنفات الواردة في البند 1(و) أدناه، وهي التي تشكِّل إبداعات فكرية بسبب اختيار وترتيب محتوياتها. لا تعتبر مجموعة المصنفات/الأعمال مصنفا مشتقا (على النحو المحدد أعلاه) لأغراض هذا الترخيص.
ج) "توزيع": تعني أن يتاح للجمهور أصل ونُسخ المصنف أو المصنف المشتق، والذي يقرر المؤلف كيفية الانتفاع منه من خلال بيعها أو من خلال طرق نقل الملكية الأخرى.

هـ) "المؤلف وأصحاب الحقوق المجاورة": الشخص (الأشخاص) الطبيعي أو المعنوي الذي يبتكر المصنف، و يعد مؤلِفًا للمصنف من يذكر اسمه عليه أو ينسب إليه عند نشره باعتباره مؤلِفًا له ما لم يقم الدليل على غير ذلك. ويعتبر مؤلِفًا للمصنف من ينشره بغير اسمه أو باسم مستعار بشرط ألا يقوم شك في معرفة حقيقة شخصه، فإذا قام الشك اعتبر ناشر أو منتج المصنف سواء أكان شخصًا طبيعيًّا أم معنويا/اعتباريا ممثلاً للمؤلف في مباشرة حقوقه إلى أن يتم التعرف على حقيقة شخص المؤلف. أصحاب الحقوق المجاورة هم (1) الممثلون والمغنون والموسيقيون والراقصون والأشخاص الآخرون الذين يقومون بتمثيل أو غناء أو إلقاء أو المشاركة في أداء المصنفات الأدبية أو الفنية أو تعبيرات الفولكلور في حال الأداء؛ (2) المُنتِج حين يكون هو الشخص أو الجهة القانونية التي تُثَبِت أولاً أصوات الأداء أو غيرها من الأصوات في حالة التسجيل الصوتي؛ (3) المؤسسة التي تبثُّ البرنامج في حال البرامج الإذاعية.
و) "المصنف/العمل": كل إنتاج في المجال الأدبي أو العلمي أو الفني أيًا كانت طريقة أو شكل التعبير عنه أو أهميته أو الغرض منه.

ح) "الأداء العلني": ويعني العلانية في أداء المصنف وإتاحته للجمهور علنياً بأيَّة وسيلة أو طريقة بما في ذلك الوسائل السلكية أو اللاسلكية، وتوفير المصنفات للجمهور على نحو يتيح لهم الوصول إلى هذه المصنفات من أي مكان وفي أي زمان يختارونه بأنفسهم، وأداء المصنف للجمهور بأيَّة وسيلة أو طريقة وتوصيل الأداء للجمهور بما في ذلك الأداء العلني الرقمي، وبث وإعادة بث المصنف بأيَّة وسيلة بما في ذلك الإشارات أو الأصوات أو الصور.
ط) "إعادة نسخ": ويعني عمل نسخ من المصنف بأيَّة وسيلة بما في ذلك على سبيل المثال لا الحصر، التسجيلات الصوتية أو المرئية إعادة نسخ تسجيلات المصنف بما في ذلك تخزين الأداء أو التسجيل الصوتي المحمي بشكل رقمي أو غيرها من الوسائل الإلكترونية.
2) قيود واستثناءات على حقوق المؤلف الاستئثارية: لا شيء في هذا الترخيص يهدف إلى تقليل أو تقييد أو الحدّ من أي استعمالات مستثناة بموجب قانون حقوق المؤلف أو من الحقوق الناشئة عن القيود أو الاستعمالات المباحة المنصوص عليها في قانون حقوق المؤلف أو غيره من القوانين المعمول بها.
3) منح الترخيص: مع مراعاة بنود وشروط هذا الترخيص، يمنح المُرَخِّص ترخيصًا عالميًّا غير حصري بدون جعالات/إتاوات سارية المفعول طوال مدَّة حماية حقوق المؤلف للقيام بما يلي:
أ) نسخ المصنف، واستعماله في مجموعة مصنفات/أعمال ونسخها.
ب) ابتكار ونسخ المصنفات بما في ذلك أي ترجمة لها بأية وسيلة كانت، مع ذكر أن المصنف الأصلي ترجم من لغة إلى أخرى.
جـ) توزيع المصنف وأداؤه علنًا منفرداً أو ضمن مجموعة مصنفات/أعمال.
د) توزيع المصنفات المشتقة وأداؤها علنًا.
‌هـ) من أجل تجنب الشك :
أنظمة التراخيص الإجبارية غير القابلة للتنازل عنها: في الأنظمة التي لا يجوز فيها التنازل عن الحق في تحصيل الجعالات/الإتاوات من التراخيص الإجبارية، يحتفظ المرخص بحقه الإستئثاري في تحصيل تلك الجعالات/الإتاوات عن أي ممارسة من قبل المرخص له للحقوق الممنوحة بموجب هذا الترخيص.
أنظمة التراخيص الإجبارية القابلة للتنازل عنها: في الأنظمة التي يمكن فيها التنازل عن الحق في تحصيل الجعالات/الإتاوات من التراخيص الإجبارية، يتنازل المرخص عن حقه الإستئثاري في تحصيل تلك الجعالات/الإتاوات عن أي ممارسة من قبل المرخص له للحقوق الممنوحة بموجب هذا الترخيص.
أنظمة الترخيص الاختياري: يتنازل المرخص بحقه في تحصيل الجعالات/الإتاوات، سواء بشكل فردي أو من خلال جمعية الإدارة الجماعية لتلك التراخيص الاختيارية التي يكون المرخص عضوا فيها، عن أي ممارسة من قبل المرخص له للحقوق الممنوحة بموجب هذا الترخيص.
یجوز ممارسة الحقوق المذكورة أعلاه في جمیع وسائل الإعلام والأشكال سواء كانت‬ معروفة في الوقت الراهن أو عُرِفت فیما بعد. وتشمل الحقوق أعلاه حق إجراء التعدیلات‬ اللازمة فنیًّا لممارسة الحقوق بوسائل الإعلام وأشكال أخرى، وتُحفظ بموجب هذا الترخیص ‬جمیع الحقوق غیر الممنوحة صراحةً من المُرَخِّص.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬
4) القيود:يتم إبرام الترخيص الممنوح في البند (3) أعلاه بشكلٍ صريح مع مراعاة القيود التالية:
أ) يخضع توزيع المصنف أو أداؤه علنًا لبنود هذا الترخيص فقط. ويتوجب إدراج نسخة من هذا الترخيص أو إدراج معرّف المصدر الموحَّد (URI) لهذا الترخيص مع كل نسخة من المصنف الذي يقوم المرخَّص له بتوزيعه أو أدائه علانية حسب شروط هذا الترخيص. ولا يجوز عرض أو فرض أية شروط على المصنف من شأنها أن تقيُّد بنود هذا الترخيص أو تقيد من قدرة مستلم المصنف المرخص به على ممارسة الحقوق الممنوحة له بموجب بنود الترخيص. ولا يجوز كذلك ترخيص المصنف من الباطن. ويجب الحفاظ على جميع الإشعارات التي تشير إلى هذا الترخيص والى التنازل عن الضمانات مع كل نسخة من المصنف الذي يقوم المرخَّص له بتوزيعه أو أدائه علانية. وعند توزيع المصنف أو أدائه علانية لا يجوز فرض أي تدابير تكنولوجية على المصنف من شأنها أن تحدّ من قدرة مستلم المصنف على ممارسة الحقوق الممنوحة له بموجب بنود الترخيص. وينطبق هذا البند 4(أ) على المصنف حين يكون مدمجًا في مجموعة مصنفات/أعمال، ولكن هذا لا يقتضي أن تخضع مجموعة المصنفات/الأعمال لبنود هذا الترخيص بمعزل عن المصنف بحدِّ ذاته. وفي حال ابتكار مجموعة مصنفات/أعمال يجب، بناءً على إشعار من المُرَخِّص، إزالة أي إشارة إلى نسب المصنف الواردة في البند 4(ب) أدناه. كما أنه في حال ابتكار مصنف مشتق يقتضي، بناءً على إشعار من المُرَخِّص، إزالة أي إشارة إلى نسب المصنف الواردة في البند 4(ب) أدناه.
ب‌) إذا قام المرخَّص له بتوزيع المصنف أو أي مصنفات مشتقة أو مجموعات مصنفات/أعمال أو قام بأدائها بشكل علني، فإنه يتوجب عليه – ما لم يتم الاتفاق على عكس ذلك بموجب البند 4(أ) – المحافظة على جميع إخطارات حقوق المؤلف الخاصة بالمصنف، وتقديم ما يلي بما يتناسب مع الأداة أو الوسيلة التي يستخدمها وبخاصة:
اسم المؤلف أو صاحب حقوق المؤلف (أو الاسم المستعار) إن وجد في حال كان مذكورا، و/أو إذا كان المؤلف أو صاحب حقوق المؤلف و/أو المُرَخِّص أشار في إخطارات حقوق المؤلف، أو حسب شروط الخدمة، أو عبر وسائل أخرى، اسم ذلك الطرف أو أطراف أخرى (مثل مؤسسة رعاية أو دار نشر أو دار صحافة) لنسب المصنف باسمها ("أطراف نسب المصنف")؛
عنوان المصنف في حال كان مذكورا؛
يجب، في الحدود المعقولة من الناحية العملية، ذكر معرِّف المصدر الموحد إن وجد والذي يحدده المُرَخِّص على أنه مرتبط بالمصنف ما لم يكن معرِّف المصدر الموحد هذا لا يشير إلى إخطارات حقوق المؤلف أو المعلومات المتعلقة بترخيص المصنف؛
تماشيًا مع البند 3(ب)، في حالة مصنف مشتق معين، إشارة تُقرر استخدام المصنف في مصنف مشتق (مثلاً ترجمة المصنف إلى اللغة الفرنسية من قبل المؤلف الأصلي، أو نص سينمائي مبني على المصنف الأصلي الذي ابتكره المؤلف الأصلي). يمكن تنفيذ الإشارة المطلوبة بموجب هذا البند 4(ب) بأية وسيلة معقولة، شرط أنه في حالة المصنف المشتق أو مجموعة المصنفات/الأعمال، يجب أن تظهر إشارة لجميع المؤلفين المساهمين في المصنف المشتق أو مجموعة المصنفات/الأعمال، بصورة تكون بارزة على الأقل بقدر إبراز إقرارات المؤلفين الأصليين. وبغية تجنب الشك، يحق للمرخَّص له استخدام الإشارة المطلوبة بموجب هذا البند فقط لغرض نسب المصنف بالطريقة المبينة أعلاه وذلك من خلال ممارسة حقوقه بموجب هذا الترخيص. ولا يجوز أن يؤكد أو يشير ضمنًا أو صراحةً إلى أية رعاية أو مصادقة أو صلة مع المؤلف الأصلي و/أو المُرَخِّص و/أو أطراف نسب المصنف – حيث يكون مناسبًا – للمرخَّص له أو لاستخدامه للمصنف دون الحصول على إذن خطي صريح مسبق ومنفصل من المؤلف الأصلي و/أو المُرَخِّص و/أو أطراف نسب المصنف.
جـ) لحقوق المعنوية/الأدبية:
إن الحقوق المعنوية/الأدبية للمؤلف هي حقوق غير قابلة للتنازل أو التصرف بها ولا تتأثر ببنود هذا الترخيص.
5) الضمانات والتنازل:
ما لم يتم الاتفاق المتبادل خطيا بين الأطراف وإلى المدى الذي يسمح به القانون، يقدم المُرَخِّص المصنف كما هو ولا يقدم أي ضمانات من أي نوع سواء كانت صريحة أو ضمنية أو قانونية أو غير ذلك، بما في ذلك على سبيل المثال لا الحصر ضمانات الملكية، وضمان رواج المصنف في السوق وضمان ملائمة المصنف لغاية معينة، وضمان عدم التعدي أو غياب العيب الخفي أو عيوب أخرى أو وجود أو عدم وجود أخطاء في المصنف سواء كانت أو لم تكن قابلة للاكتشاف. في التشريعات التي لا تجيز استثناء الضمانات غير الصريحة (الضمنية)، لا ينطبق هذا الاستثناء على المرخَّص له.
6) تحديد المسؤولية:
باستثناء ما هو مصرح به بموجب القانون المعمول به، لا يكون المُرَخِّص بأي حال من الأحوال مسئولا تجاه المرخَّص له وفق أي مبدأ قانوني عن أي أضرار طارئة أو مترابطة أو عقابية ممكن أن تنجم عن هذا الترخيص أو عن استعمال المصنف، حتى إن تم إبلاغ المُرَخِّص باحتمالية حدوث مثل تلك الأضرار.
7) إنهاء الترخيص:
أ) ينتهي هذا الترخيص والحقوق الممنوحة بموجبه تلقائيًّا في حالة قيام المرخَّص له بخرق أي بند من بنوده. ولا يتم إنهاء تراخيص الأشخاص الطبيعيين أو المعنويين/الاعتباريين الذين استلموا من المرخَّص له مصنفات مشتقة أو مجموعة مصنفات أعمال بموجب هذا الترخيص، شرط أن يبقى هؤلاء الأشخاص ملتزمين بكامل شروط تلك التراخيص. وتبقى البنود 1، 2، 5، 6، 8،7 نافذة المفعول حتى بعد أي إنهاء لهذا الترخيص.
ب) مع مراعاة البنود والشروط المذكورة أعلاه، يكون الترخيص الممنوح نافذ المفعول بشكل دائم (طوال مدة حماية حقوق المؤلف). وعلى الرغم مما سبق، يحتفظ المُرَخِّص بحق نشر المصنف تحت شروط مختلفة أو وقف توزيع المصنف في أي وقت، شرط أن لا يكون الغرض من ذلك سحب هذا الترخيص (أو أي ترخيص آخر تم منحه أو يُطلب منحه بموجب بنود هذا الترخيص)، ويبقى هذا الترخيص نافذا وساري المفعول بالكامل ما لم يتم إنهاؤه كما هو مذكور أعلاه.
8) ملحق :
أ‌) في كل مرة يقوم فيها المرخَّص له بتوزيع المصنف أو مجموعة مصنفات/أعمال أو أدائه/أدائها بشكل علني، فإن المُرَخِّص يمنح المستلم ترخيصًا بالاستعمال وفق نفس بنود وشروط هذا الترخيص الممنوح للمرخَّص له.
‌ب) في كل مرة يقوم فيها المرخَّص له بتوزيع مصنف مشتق ما أو أدائه بشكل علني، فإن المُرَخِّص يمنح المستلم ترخيصًا بالاستعمال وفق نفس بنود وشروط هذا الترخيص الممنوح للمرخَّص له.
‌جـ) في حال كان أي بند من بنود هذا الترخيص غير ساري المفعول أو غير قابل للتطبيق بموجب القوانين المعمول بها، فإنه لا يؤثر على صحة أو قابلية إنفاذ بقية البنود، ويجب تعديل هذا البند في الحد اللازم لجعله صحيحًا وقابلاً للإنفاذ وذلك دون الحاجة لاتخاذ أي إجراء آخر من قبل أطراف هذا الترخيص.
‌د) لا يُعتبر أي بند أو نص في هذا الترخيص متنازلاً عنه، ولا يعتبر أي خرق موافقا عليه ما لم يتم ذلك التنازل أو الموافقة خطيًّا ويتم التوقيع عليه من قبل الطرف المسئول عن مثل هذا التنازل أو الموافقة.
‌هـ) يشكل هذا الترخيص مجمل الاتفاق بين الأطراف فيما يتعلق بالمصنف المُرخَّص باستعماله. ولا يتعلق هذا الترخيص بأية تفاهمات أو اتفاقيات أو إقرارات فيما يتعلق بمصنفات أخرى غير المصنف المحدد هنا. لا يلتزم المُرَخِّص بأية نصوص أو شروط أخرى قد يرسلها المرخَّص له. كما لا يجوز تعديل هذا الترخيص دون اتفاق خطي متبادل بين المرخَّص له والمُرَخِّص.
‌و) إن الحقوق الممنوحة بموجب هذا الترخيص تمت صياغتها بصورة تتوافق مع المصطلحات الواردة في معاهدة برن لحماية الحقوق الأدبية والفنية لعام 1886 مع تعديلاتها اللاحقة (1979) واتفاقية روما لعام 1961 ومعاهدة المنظمة العالمية للملكية الفكرية (وايبو) بشأن حقوق المؤلف لعام 1996 والمعاهدة العالمية لحقوق المؤلف (حسب تعديل عام 1971). إن الحقوق الممنوحة بموجب هذا الترخيص تكون مطبقة في الدول حسب قوانينها الوطنية النافذة. إذا كانت قوانين الملكية الفكرية في دولة ما تضم حقوقا إضافية لم ينص عليها بموجب هذا الترخيص فإن هذه الحقوق الإضافية تعتبر مشمولة ببنود هذا الترخيص؛ ولا يقصد بهذا الترخيص تقييد الترخيص بأية حقوق أخرى معمول بها بموجب القانون الواجب التطبيق.

L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ ESTÀ PROTEGIDA PER LA LLEI ESPANYOLA DE PROPIETAT INTEL·LECTUAL O QUALSEVOL ALTRA NORMA APLICABLE. QUEDA PROHIBIT QUALSEVOL ÚS DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ DIFERENT DEL QUE AUTORITZI AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA O DISPOSIN LES LLEIS DE PROPIETAT INTEL·LECTUAL. 
 
L'EXERCICI DE QUALSEVOL DRET SOBRE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ COMPORTA QUE ACCEPTEU LES LIMITACIONS I OBLIGACIONS D'AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA I HI CONSENTIU, SENSE PERJUDICI DE LA NECESSITAT DE CONSENTIMENT EXPRÉS EN CAS DE VIOLACIÓ PRÈVIA DE LES SEVES CONDICIONS. EL LLICENCIADOR US CONCEDEIX ELS DRETS CONTINGUTS EN AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA, SEMPRE QUE N'ACCEPTEU LES CONDICIONS QUE HI SÓN PRESENTS. 
 
1. Definicions 
 
L'obra és la creació literària, artística o científica oferta en els termes d'aquesta llicència. 
En aquesta llicència es considera una prestació qualsevol interpretació, execució, fonograma, enregistrament audiovisual, emissió o transmissió, mera fotografia o qualsevol altre objecte protegit per la legislació de propietat intel·lectual vigent aplicable. 
L'aplicació d'aquesta llicència a una col·lecció (definida més endavant) afectarà únicament l'estructura com a forma d'expressió de la selecció o disposició dels continguts, i no es farà extensiva a aquests. En aquest cas la col·lecció tindrà la consideració d'obra a efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
El titular originari és: 
En el cas d'una obra literària, artística o científica, la persona natural o el grup de persones que l'ha creada. 
En el cas d'una obra col·lectiva, la persona que l'editi i el divulgui amb el seu nom, llevat que hi hagi un pacte contrari. 
En el cas d'una interpretació o execució, l'actor, cantant, músic, o qualsevol altra persona que representi, canti, llegeixi, reciti, interpreti o executi de qualsevulla manera una obra. 
En el cas d'un fonograma, el productor fonogràfic, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica sota la iniciativa i responsabilitat de la qual es fa per primera vegada una fixació exclusivament sonora de l'execució d'una obra o d'altres sons. 
En el cas d'un enregistrament audiovisual, el productor de l'enregistrament, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica que tingui la iniciativa i assumeixi la responsabilitat de les fixacions d'un pla o una seqüència d'imatges, amb o sense so. 
En el cas d'una emissió o una transmissió, l'entitat de radiodifusió. 
En el cas d'una mera fotografia, aquella persona que l'hagi realitzada. 
En el cas d'altres objectes protegits per la legislació de la propietat intel·lectual vigent, la persona que aquesta indiqui. 
Es consideraran obres derivades aquelles obres creades a partir de l'objecte d'aquesta llicència com, per exemple, les traduccions i adaptacions; les revisions, actualitzacions i anotacions; els compendis, resums i extractes; els arranjaments musicals, i en general qualsevol transformació d'una obra literària, artística o científica. Per aclarir dubtes, si l'obra consisteix en una composició musical o en un enregistrament de sons, la sincronització temporal de l'obra amb una imatge en moviment (synching) serà considerada com una obra derivada als efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
Tindran la consideració de col·leccions la recopilació d'obres alienes, de dades o d'altres elements independents com ara les antologies i les bases de dades que per la selecció o disposició de llurs continguts constitueixin creacions intel·lectuals. La mera incorporació d'una obra en una col·lecció no donarà lloc a una obra derivada a efectes d'aquesta llicència. 
El llicenciador és la persona o l'entitat que ofereix l'obra o la prestació subjecta als termes d'aquesta llicència i que en concedeix els drets d'explotació conforme al que s'hi disposa. 
Vós sou la persona o l'entitat que exerceix els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència i que prèviament no ha violat els termes d'aquesta llicència respecte a l'obra o la prestació, o que ha rebut un permís exprés del llicenciador per exercir els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència malgrat una violació anterior. 
La transformació d'una obra comprèn la traducció, l'adaptació i qualsevol altra modificació de la qual derivi una obra diferent. La creació resultant de la transformació d'una obra tindrà la consideració d'obra derivada. 
S'entén per reproducció la fixació directa o indirecta, provisional o permanent, per qualsevol mitjà i en qualsevol forma, de tota l'obra o la prestació o de part d'ella, que en permeti la comunicació o l'obtenció de còpies. 
S'entén per distribució el fet de posar a disposició del públic l'original o les còpies de l'obra o la prestació mitjançant la venda, el lloguer, el préstec o qualsevol altre sistema. 
S'entén per comunicació pública qualsevol acte mitjançant el qual una pluralitat de persones, que no pertanyin a l'àmbit domèstic de qui la duu a terme, pot tenir accés a l'obra o la prestació sense que se'ls hagi fet una distribució prèvia d'exemplars. Es considera comunicació pública el fet de posar l'obra o la prestació a disposició del públic per procediments electrònics amb fil o sense fil de manera que qualsevol persona pugui accedir-hi des d'on vulgui i quan vulgui. 
L'explotació de l'obra o la prestació comprèn la reproducció, la distribució, la comunicació pública i, en el seu cas, la transformació. 
2. Límits dels drets. No hi ha res en aquesta llicència que pretengui reduir o restringir qualsevol dels límits legals dels drets exclusius del titular dels drets de propietat intel·lectual d'acord amb la Llei de propietat intel·lectual o qualsevol altra normativa aplicable, ja siguin drets derivats d'usos legítims —com ara la còpia privada o la citació— ja siguin altres limitacions —com la que resulta de la primera venda d'exemplars (exhauriment). 
 
3. Concessió de llicència. Conforme a les condicions d'aquesta llicència, el llicenciador concedeix, pel termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual i a títol gratuït, una llicència d'àmbit mundial no exclusiva que inclou els drets següents: 
 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació. 
Dret d'incorporar l'obra o la prestació en una o més col·leccions. 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació lícitament incorporada en una col·lecció. 
Dret de transformar l'obra per crear-ne una obra derivada sempre que s'hi inclogui una indicació de la transformació o modificació efectuada. 
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament les obres derivades creades a partir de l'obra subjecta a la llicència. 
Dret d'extraure i reutilitzar l'obra o la prestació d'una base de dades. 
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, el titular originari: 
Conserva el dret de percebre les remuneracions o compensacions previstes por actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació, qualificades per la llei com a irrenunciables i inalienables i subjectes a gestió col·lectiva obligatòria. 
Renuncia al dret exclusiu de percebre, tant individualment com mitjançant una entitat de gestió col·lectiva de drets, qualsevol remuneració derivada d'actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació que feu. 
Aquests drets es poden exercir en tots els mitjans i formats, tangibles o intangibles, coneguts en el moment de concessió d'aquesta llicència. Els drets esmentats inclouen el dret a efectuar les modificacions que siguin tècnicament necessàries per exercir els drets en altres mitjans i formats. Tots aquells drets no concedits expressament pel llicenciador queden reservats, incloent-hi, a títol enunciatiu però no limitatiu, els drets morals irrenunciables reconeguts per la llei aplicable. En la mesura que el llicenciador tingui drets exclusius previstos per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea en matèria de dret sui generis sobre bases de dades, renuncia expressament a aquests drets exclusius. 
 
4. Restriccions. La concessió de drets que implica aquesta llicència està subjecta i limitada a les restriccions següents: 
 
Podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació només en els termes d'aquesta llicència i n'heu d'incloure una còpia, o l'identificador uniforme de recursos (URI) corresponent. No podeu oferir o imposar cap condició sobre l'obra o la prestació que alteri o restringeixi els termes d'aquesta llicència o l'exercici dels drets per part dels seus concessionaris. No podeu subllicenciar l'obra o la prestació. Heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos referents a aquesta llicència i a l'absència de garanties. No podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació amb mesures tecnològiques que en controlin l'accés o l'ús d'una manera contrària als termes d'aquesta llicència. Aquesta secció 4.a també afecta l'obra o la prestació incorporada en una col·lecció, però no implica que la col·lecció en conjunt automàticament quedi o hagi de quedar subjecta als mateixos termes. En el cas que us sigui requerit, mitjançant una comunicació prèvia del llicenciador, si incorporeu l'obra o la prestació en una col·lecció o en creeu una obra derivada, haureu d'eliminar qualsevol dels crèdits requerits en l'apartat 4.b, fins on sigui possible. 
Si reproduïu, distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament l'obra o la prestació, una col·lecció que la incorpori o qualsevol obra derivada, heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos sobre la propietat intel·lectual i indicar, de manera raonable conforme al mitjà o als mitjans que useu: 
El nom de l'autor original, o el pseudònim si és el cas, així com el del titular originari, si s'ha facilitat. 
El nom d'aquelles parts (per exemple: institució, publicació, revista) que el titular originari o el llicenciador designin perquè siguin reconegudes en l'avís legal, les condicions d'ús, o de qualsevol altra manera raonable. 
El títol de l'obra o la prestació si s'ha facilitat. 
L'URI, si n'hi ha, que el llicenciador especifiqui perquè sigui vinculat a l'obra o la prestació, llevat que aquest URI no es refereixi a l'avís legal o a la informació sobre la llicència de l'obra o la prestació. 
En el cas d'una obra derivada, un avís que identifiqui la transformació de l'obra en l'obra derivada (p. ex., «traducció catalana de l'obra de l'autor original», o «guió basat en l'obra original de l'autor original»). 
Aquest reconeixement s'ha de fer de manera raonable. En el cas d'una obra derivada o d'una incorporació en una col·lecció, aquests crèdits hauran d'aparèixer com a mínim en el mateix lloc on hi hagi els corresponents a altres autors o titulars i de forma comparable a aquests. Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, els crèdits requerits en aquesta secció només s'usaran a efectes d'atribució de l'obra o la prestació en la manera especificada anteriorment. Sense un permís previ per escrit, no podeu afirmar ni fer entendre implícitament ni explícitament cap connexió, patrocini o aprovació per part del titular originari, el llicenciador o les parts reconegudes cap a vós o cap l'ús que feu de l'obra o la prestació. 
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, s'ha de fer notar que les restriccions anteriors (paràgrafs 4.a i 4.b) no s'aplicaran a les parts de l'obra o la prestació subjecta a aquesta llicència que únicament puguin ser protegides mitjançant el dret sui generis sobre bases de dades recollit per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea de bases de dades. 
5. Exoneració de responsabilitat 
 
LLEVAT QUE S'ACORDI MÚTUAMENT ENTRE LES PARTS, EL LLICENCIADOR OFEREIX L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ TAL COM ÉS (ON AN AS-IS BASIS) I NO CONFEREIX GARANTIA DE CAP MENA RESPECTE DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ O LA PRESÈNCIA O L'ABSÈNCIA D'ERRORS QUE ES PUGUIN DETECTAR O NO. ALGUNES JURISDICCIONS NO PERMETEN L'EXCLUSIÓ D'AQUESTES GARANTIES, DE MANERA QUE AQUESTA EXCLUSIÓ POT NO SER APLICABLE EN EL VOSTRE CAS. 
 
6. Limitació de responsabilitat. LLEVAT QUE LA LLEI APLICABLE HO DISPOSI EXPRESSAMENT I IMPERATIVAMENT, EN CAP CAS EL LLICENCIADOR SERÀ RESPONSABLE DAVANT VOSTRE PER QUALSEVOL DANY QUE EN PUGUI RESULTAR, TANT SI ÉS GENERAL COM ESPECIAL (INCLOSOS EL DANY EMERGENT I EL LUCRE CESSANT), FORTUÏT O CAUSAL, DIRECTE O INDIRECTE, PRODUÏT PER L'ÚS DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ DURANT EL PERÍODE EN QUÈ S'ESTÉN AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA, ENCARA QUE EL LLICENCIADOR HAGUÉS ESTAT INFORMAT DE LA POSSIBILITAT D'AQUESTS DANYS. 
 
7. Finalització de la llicència 
 
Aquesta llicència i la concessió dels drets que conté acabaran automàticament en cas que se n'incompleixi qualsevol dels termes. No obstant això, no s'anul·larà la llicència d'aquelles persones o entitats que hagin rebut obres derivades o col·leccions vostres amb aquesta llicència, sempre que aquestes persones o entitats es mantinguin en el compliment íntegre d'aquesta llicència. Les seccions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, i 8 continuaran vigents malgrat que finalitzi aquesta llicència. 
Conforme a les condicions anteriors, la concessió de drets d'aquesta llicència és vigent per tot el termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual segons la llei aplicable. Malgrat això, el llicenciador es reserva el dret a divulgar o publicar l'obra o la prestació en condicions diferents a les presents, o a retirar-la en qualsevol moment. Tanmateix, això no suposarà donar per conclosa aquesta llicència (o qualsevol altra llicència que hagi estat concedida, o calgui concedir, en els termes d'aquesta llicència), sinó que continuarà vigent i amb efectes complets, a menys que no hagi finalitzat conforme allò establert anteriorment, sense perjudici del dret moral de penediment en els termes reconeguts per la llei de propietat intel·lectual aplicable. 
8. Miscel·lània 
 
Cada vegada que exploteu d'alguna manera l'obra o la prestació, o una col·lecció que la incorpori, el llicenciador ofereix als tercers i successius llicenciataris la concessió de drets sobre l'obra o la prestació, en les mateixes condicions que la llicència que us ha estat concedida. 
Cada vegada que exploteu d'alguna manera una obra derivada, el llicenciador original ofereix als tercers i successius llicenciataris la concessió de drets sobre l'obra subjecta a aquesta llicència, en les mateixes condicions que la llicència que us ha estat concedida. 
Si alguna disposició d'aquesta llicència resulta invàlida o inaplicable segons la llei vigent, això no afectarà la validesa o l'aplicabilitat de la resta dels termes d'aquesta llicència i, sense cap acció addicional per a qualsevol de les parts d'aquest acord, aquesta disposició s'entendrà reformada en allò estrictament necessari per fer que aquesta disposició sigui vàlida i executiva. 
No s'entendrà que hi ha renúncia pel que fa a algun terme o disposició d'aquesta llicència, ni que se'n consent cap violació, llevat que la renúncia o el consentiment figuri per escrit i estigui firmat per la part que renuncia o que consent. 
Aquesta llicència constitueix l'acord ple entre les parts respecte de l'obra o la prestació objecte d'aquesta llicència. No hi ha interpretacions, acords o condicions respecte de l'obra o la prestació que no s'especifiquin expressament en aquesta llicència. El llicenciador no estarà obligat per cap disposició complementària que pugui aparèixer en qualsevol comunicació vostra. Aquesta llicència no es pot modificar sense que ho acordeu per escrit amb el llicenciador.

1. Definicions
L'obra és la creació literària, artística o científica oferta en els termes d'aquesta llicència.
En aquesta llicència es considera una prestació qualsevol interpretació, execució, fonograma, enregistrament audiovisual, emissió o transmissió, mera fotografia o qualsevol altre objecte protegit per la legislació de propietat intel·lectual vigent aplicable.
L'aplicació d'aquesta llicència a una col·lecció (definida més endavant) afectarà únicament l'estructura com a forma d'expressió de la selecció o disposició dels continguts, i no es farà extensiva a aquests. En aquest cas la col·lecció tindrà la consideració d'obra a efectes d'aquesta llicència.
El titular originari és:
En el cas d'una obra literària, artística o científica, la persona natural o el grup de persones que l'ha creada.
En el cas d'una obra col·lectiva, la persona que l'editi i el divulgui amb el seu nom, llevat que hi hagi un pacte contrari.
En el cas d'una interpretació o execució, l'actor, cantant, músic, o qualsevol altra persona que representi, canti, llegeixi, reciti, interpreti o executi de qualsevulla manera una obra.
En el cas d'un fonograma, el productor fonogràfic, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica sota la iniciativa i responsabilitat de la qual es fa per primera vegada una fixació exclusivament sonora de l'execució d'una obra o d'altres sons.
En el cas d'un enregistrament audiovisual, el productor de l'enregistrament, és a dir, la persona natural o jurídica que tingui la iniciativa i assumeixi la responsabilitat de les fixacions d'un pla o una seqüència d'imatges, amb o sense so.
En el cas d'una emissió o una transmissió, l'entitat de radiodifusió.
En el cas d'una mera fotografia, aquella persona que l'hagi realitzada.
En el cas d'altres objectes protegits per la legislació de la propietat intel·lectual vigent, la persona que aquesta indiqui.
Es consideraran obres derivades aquelles obres creades a partir de l'objecte d'aquesta llicència com, per exemple, les traduccions i adaptacions; les revisions, actualitzacions i anotacions; els compendis, resums i extractes; els arranjaments musicals, i en general qualsevol transformació d'una obra literària, artística o científica. Per aclarir dubtes, si l'obra consisteix en una composició musical o en un enregistrament de sons, la sincronització temporal de l'obra amb una imatge en moviment (synching) serà considerada com una obra derivada als efectes d'aquesta llicència.
Tindran la consideració de col·leccions la recopilació d'obres alienes, de dades o d'altres elements independents com ara les antologies i les bases de dades que per la selecció o disposició de llurs continguts constitueixin creacions intel·lectuals. La mera incorporació d'una obra en una col·lecció no donarà lloc a una obra derivada a efectes d'aquesta llicència.
El llicenciador és la persona o l'entitat que ofereix l'obra o la prestació subjecta als termes d'aquesta llicència i que en concedeix els drets d'explotació conforme al que s'hi disposa.
Vós sou la persona o l'entitat que exerceix els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència i que prèviament no ha violat els termes d'aquesta llicència respecte a l'obra o la prestació, o que ha rebut un permís exprés del llicenciador per exercir els drets concedits mitjançant aquesta llicència malgrat una violació anterior.
La transformació d'una obra comprèn la traducció, l'adaptació i qualsevol altra modificació de la qual derivi una obra diferent. La creació resultant de la transformació d'una obra tindrà la consideració d'obra derivada.
S'entén per reproducció la fixació directa o indirecta, provisional o permanent, per qualsevol mitjà i en qualsevol forma, de tota l'obra o la prestació o de part d'ella, que en permeti la comunicació o l'obtenció de còpies.
S'entén per distribució el fet de posar a disposició del públic l'original o les còpies de l'obra o la prestació mitjançant la venda, el lloguer, el préstec o qualsevol altre sistema.
S'entén per comunicació pública qualsevol acte mitjançant el qual una pluralitat de persones, que no pertanyin a l'àmbit domèstic de qui la duu a terme, pot tenir accés a l'obra o la prestació sense que se'ls hagi fet una distribució prèvia d'exemplars. Es considera comunicació pública el fet de posar l'obra o la prestació a disposició del públic per procediments electrònics amb fil o sense fil de manera que qualsevol persona pugui accedir-hi des d'on vulgui i quan vulgui.
L'explotació de l'obra o la prestació comprèn la reproducció, la distribució, la comunicació pública i, en el seu cas, la transformació.
2. Límits dels drets. No hi ha res en aquesta llicència que pretengui reduir o restringir qualsevol dels límits legals dels drets exclusius del titular dels drets de propietat intel·lectual d'acord amb la Llei de propietat intel·lectual o qualsevol altra normativa aplicable, ja siguin drets derivats d'usos legítims —com ara la còpia privada o la citació— ja siguin altres limitacions —com la que resulta de la primera venda d'exemplars (exhauriment).
3. Concessió de llicència. Conforme a les condicions d'aquesta llicència, el llicenciador concedeix, pel termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual i a títol gratuït, una llicència d'àmbit mundial no exclusiva que inclou els drets següents:
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació.
Dret d'incorporar l'obra o la prestació en una o més col·leccions.
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació lícitament incorporada en una col·lecció.
Dret de transformar l'obra per crear-ne una obra derivada sempre que s'hi inclogui una indicació de la transformació o modificació efectuada.
Dret de reproduir, distribuir i comunicar públicament les obres derivades creades a partir de l'obra subjecta a la llicència.
Dret d'extraure i reutilitzar l'obra o la prestació d'una base de dades.
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, el titular originari:
Conserva el dret de percebre les remuneracions o compensacions previstes por actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació, qualificades per la llei com a irrenunciables i inalienables i subjectes a gestió col·lectiva obligatòria.
Renuncia al dret exclusiu de percebre, tant individualment com mitjançant una entitat de gestió col·lectiva de drets, qualsevol remuneració derivada d'actes d'explotació de l'obra o la prestació que feu.
Aquests drets es poden exercir en tots els mitjans i formats, tangibles o intangibles, coneguts en el moment de concessió d'aquesta llicència. Els drets esmentats inclouen el dret a efectuar les modificacions que siguin tècnicament necessàries per exercir els drets en altres mitjans i formats. Tots aquells drets no concedits expressament pel llicenciador queden reservats, incloent-hi, a títol enunciatiu però no limitatiu, els drets morals irrenunciables reconeguts per la llei aplicable. En la mesura que el llicenciador tingui drets exclusius previstos per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea en matèria de dret sui generis sobre bases de dades, renuncia expressament a aquests drets exclusius.
4. Restriccions. La concessió de drets que implica aquesta llicència està subjecta i limitada a les restriccions següents:
Podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació només en els termes d'aquesta llicència i n'heu d'incloure una còpia, o l'identificador uniforme de recursos (URI) corresponent. No podeu oferir o imposar cap condició sobre l'obra o la prestació que alteri o restringeixi els termes d'aquesta llicència o l'exercici dels drets per part dels seus concessionaris. No podeu subllicenciar l'obra o la prestació. Heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos referents a aquesta llicència i a l'absència de garanties. No podeu reproduir, distribuir o comunicar públicament l'obra o la prestació amb mesures tecnològiques que en controlin l'accés o l'ús d'una manera contrària als termes d'aquesta llicència. Aquesta secció 4.a també afecta l'obra o la prestació incorporada en una col·lecció, però no implica que la col·lecció en conjunt automàticament quedi o hagi de quedar subjecta als mateixos termes. En el cas que us sigui requerit, mitjançant una comunicació prèvia del llicenciador, si incorporeu l'obra o la prestació en una col·lecció o en creeu una obra derivada, haureu d'eliminar qualsevol dels crèdits requerits en l'apartat 4.b, fins on sigui possible.
Si reproduïu, distribuïu o comuniqueu públicament l'obra o la prestació, una col·lecció que la incorpori o qualsevol obra derivada, heu de mantenir intactes tots els avisos sobre la propietat intel·lectual i indicar, de manera raonable conforme al mitjà o als mitjans que useu:
El nom de l'autor original, o el pseudònim si és el cas, així com el del titular originari, si s'ha facilitat.
El nom d'aquelles parts (per exemple: institució, publicació, revista) que el titular originari o el llicenciador designin perquè siguin reconegudes en l'avís legal, les condicions d'ús, o de qualsevol altra manera raonable.
El títol de l'obra o la prestació si s'ha facilitat.
L'URI, si n'hi ha, que el llicenciador especifiqui perquè sigui vinculat a l'obra o la prestació, llevat que aquest URI no es refereixi a l'avís legal o a la informació sobre la llicència de l'obra o la prestació.
En el cas d'una obra derivada, un avís que identifiqui la transformació de l'obra en l'obra derivada (p. ex., «traducció catalana de l'obra de l'autor original», o «guió basat en l'obra original de l'autor original»).
Aquest reconeixement s'ha de fer de manera raonable. En el cas d'una obra derivada o d'una incorporació en una col·lecció, aquests crèdits hauran d'aparèixer com a mínim en el mateix lloc on hi hagi els corresponents a altres autors o titulars i de forma comparable a aquests. Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, els crèdits requerits en aquesta secció només s'usaran a efectes d'atribució de l'obra o la prestació en la manera especificada anteriorment. Sense un permís previ per escrit, no podeu afirmar ni fer entendre implícitament ni explícitament cap connexió, patrocini o aprovació per part del titular originari, el llicenciador o les parts reconegudes cap a vós o cap l'ús que feu de l'obra o la prestació.
Per aclarir qualsevol dubte, s'ha de fer notar que les restriccions anteriors (paràgrafs 4.a i 4.b) no s'aplicaran a les parts de l'obra o la prestació subjecta a aquesta llicència que únicament puguin ser protegides mitjançant el dret sui generis sobre bases de dades recollit per la llei nacional vigent que implementa la directiva europea de bases de dades.
5. Exoneració de responsabilitat
LLEVAT QUE S'ACORDI MÚTUAMENT ENTRE LES PARTS, EL LLICENCIADOR OFEREIX L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ TAL COM ÉS (ON AN AS-IS BASIS) I NO CONFEREIX GARANTIA DE CAP MENA RESPECTE DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ O LA PRESÈNCIA O L'ABSÈNCIA D'ERRORS QUE ES PUGUIN DETECTAR O NO. ALGUNES JURISDICCIONS NO PERMETEN L'EXCLUSIÓ D'AQUESTES GARANTIES, DE MANERA QUE AQUESTA EXCLUSIÓ POT NO SER APLICABLE EN EL VOSTRE CAS.
6. Limitació de responsabilitat. LLEVAT QUE LA LLEI APLICABLE HO DISPOSI EXPRESSAMENT I IMPERATIVAMENT, EN CAP CAS EL LLICENCIADOR SERÀ RESPONSABLE DAVANT VOSTRE PER QUALSEVOL DANY QUE EN PUGUI RESULTAR, TANT SI ÉS GENERAL COM ESPECIAL (INCLOSOS EL DANY EMERGENT I EL LUCRE CESSANT), FORTUÏT O CAUSAL, DIRECTE O INDIRECTE, PRODUÏT PER L'ÚS DE L'OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓ DURANT EL PERÍODE EN QUÈ S'ESTÉN AQUESTA LLICÈNCIA, ENCARA QUE EL LLICENCIADOR HAGUÉS ESTAT INFORMAT DE LA POSSIBILITAT D'AQUESTS DANYS.
7. Finalització de la llicència
Aquesta llicència i la concessió dels drets que conté acabaran automàticament en cas que se n'incompleixi qualsevol dels termes. No obstant això, no s'anul·larà la llicència d'aquelles persones o entitats que hagin rebut obres derivades o col·leccions vostres amb aquesta llicència, sempre que aquestes persones o entitats es mantinguin en el compliment íntegre d'aquesta llicència. Les seccions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, i 8 continuaran vigents malgrat que finalitzi aquesta llicència.
Conforme a les condicions anteriors, la concessió de drets d'aquesta llicència és vigent per tot el termini de protecció dels drets de propietat intel·lectual segons la llei aplicable. Malgrat això, el llicenciador es reserva el dret a divulgar o publicar l'obra o la prestació en condicions diferents a les presents, o a retirar-la en qualsevol moment. Tanmateix, això no suposarà donar per conclosa aquesta llicència (o qualsevol altra llicència que hagi estat concedida, o calgui concedir, en els termes d'aquesta llicència), sinó que continuarà vigent i amb efectes complets, a menys que no hagi finalitzat conforme allò establert anteriorment, sense perjudici del dret moral de penediment en els termes reconeguts per la llei de propietat intel·lectual aplicable.
8. Miscel·lània
Cada vegada que exploteu d'alguna manera l'obra o la prestació, o una col·lecció que la incorpori, el llicenciador ofereix als tercers i successius llicenciataris la concessió de drets sobre l'obra o la prestació, en les mateixes condicions que la llicència que us ha estat concedida.

LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN (SEGÚN SE DEFINEN MÁS ADELANTE) SE PROPORCIONA BAJO LOS TÉRMINOS DE ESTA LICENCIA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS (CCPL O LICENCIA). LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN SE ENCUENTRA PROTEGIDA POR LA LEY ESPAÑOLA DE PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL Y/O CUALESQUIERA OTRAS NORMAS QUE RESULTEN DE APLICACIÓN. QUEDA PROHIBIDO CUALQUIER USO DE LA OBRA O PRESTACIÓN DIFERENTE A LO AUTORIZADO BAJO ESTA LICENCIA O LO DISPUESTO EN LA LEY DE PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL. 
 
MEDIANTE EL EJERCICIO DE CUALQUIER DERECHO SOBRE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN, USTED ACEPTA Y CONSIENTE LAS LIMITACIONES Y OBLIGACIONES DE ESTA LICENCIA, SIN PERJUICIO DE LA NECESIDAD DE CONSENTIMIENTO EXPRESO EN CASO DE VIOLACIÓN PREVIA DE LOS TÉRMINOS DE LA MISMA. EL LICENCIADOR LE CONCEDE LOS DERECHOS CONTENIDOS EN ESTA LICENCIA, SIEMPRE QUE USTED ACEPTE LOS PRESENTES TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES. 
 
1. Definiciones 
 
La obra es la creación literaria, artística o científica ofrecida bajo los términos de esta licencia. 
En esta licencia se considera una prestación cualquier interpretación, ejecución, fonograma, grabación audiovisual, emisión o transmisión, mera fotografía u otros objetos protegidos por la legislación de propiedad intelectual vigente aplicable. 
La aplicación de esta licencia a una colección (definida más adelante) afectará únicamente a su estructura en cuanto forma de expresión de la selección o disposición de sus contenidos, no siendo extensiva a éstos. En este caso la colección tendrá la consideración de obra a efectos de esta licencia. 
El titular originario es: 
En el caso de una obra literaria, artística o científica, la persona natural o grupo de personas que creó la obra. 
En el caso de una obra colectiva, la persona que la edite y divulgue bajo su nombre, salvo pacto contrario. 
En el caso de una interpretación o ejecución, el actor, cantante, músico, o cualquier otra persona que represente, cante, lea, recite, interprete o ejecute en cualquier forma una obra. 
En el caso de un fonograma, el productor fonográfico, es decir, la persona natural o jurídica bajo cuya iniciativa y responsabilidad se realiza por primera vez una fijación exclusivamente sonora de la ejecución de una obra o de otros sonidos. 
En el caso de una grabación audiovisual, el productor de la grabación, es decir, la persona natural o jurídica que tenga la iniciativa y asuma la responsabilidad de las fijaciones de un plano o secuencia de imágenes, con o sin sonido. 
En el caso de una emisión o una transmisión, la entidad de radiodifusión. 
En el caso de una mera fotografía, aquella persona que la haya realizado. 
En el caso de otros objetos protegidos por la legislación de propiedad intelectual vigente, la persona que ésta señale. 
Se considerarán obras derivadas aquellas obras creadas a partir de la licenciada, como por ejemplo: las traducciones y adaptaciones; las revisiones, actualizaciones y anotaciones; los compendios, resúmenes y extractos; los arreglos musicales y, en general, cualesquiera transformaciones de una obra literaria, artística o científica. Para evitar la duda, si la obra consiste en una composición musical o grabación de sonidos, la sincronización temporal de la obra con una imagen en movimiento (synching) será considerada como una obra derivada a efectos de esta licencia. 
Tendrán la consideración de colecciones la recopilación de obras ajenas, de datos o de otros elementos independientes como las antologías y las bases de datos que por la selección o disposición de sus contenidos constituyan creaciones intelectuales. La mera incorporación de una obra en una colección no dará lugar a una derivada a efectos de esta licencia. 
El licenciador es la persona o la entidad que ofrece la obra o prestación bajo los términos de esta licencia y le concede los derechos de explotación de la misma conforme a lo dispuesto en ella. 
Usted es la persona o la entidad que ejercita los derechos concedidos mediante esta licencia y que no ha violado previamente los términos de la misma con respecto a la obra o la prestación, o que ha recibido el permiso expreso del licenciador de ejercitar los derechos concedidos mediante esta licencia a pesar de una violación anterior. 
La transformación de una obra comprende su traducción, adaptación y cualquier otra modificación en su forma de la que se derive una obra diferente. La creación resultante de la transformación de una obra tendrá la consideración de obra derivada. 
Se entiende por reproducción la fijación directa o indirecta, provisional o permanente, por cualquier medio y en cualquier forma, de toda la obra o la prestación o de parte de ella, que permita su comunicación o la obtención de copias. 
Se entiende por distribución la puesta a disposición del público del original o de las copias de la obra o la prestación, en un soporte tangible, mediante su venta, alquiler, préstamo o de cualquier otra forma. 
Se entiende por comunicación pública todo acto por el cual una pluralidad de personas, que no pertenezcan al ámbito doméstico de quien la lleva a cabo, pueda tener acceso a la obra o la prestación sin previa distribución de ejemplares a cada una de ellas. Se considera comunicación pública la puesta a disposición del público de obras o prestaciones por procedimientos alámbricos o inalámbricos, de tal forma que cualquier persona pueda acceder a ellas desde el lugar y en el momento que elija. 
La explotación de la obra o la prestación comprende la reproducción, la distribución, la comunicación pública y, en su caso, la transformación. 
2. Límites de los derechos. Nada en esta licencia pretende reducir o restringir cualesquiera límites legales de los derechos exclusivos del titular de los derechos de propiedad intelectual de acuerdo con la Ley de propiedad intelectual o cualesquiera otras leyes aplicables, ya sean derivados de usos legítimos, tales como la copia privada o la cita, u otras limitaciones como la resultante de la primera venta de ejemplares (agotamiento). 
 
3. Concesión de licencia. Conforme a los términos y a las condiciones de esta licencia, el licenciador concede, por el plazo de protección de los derechos de propiedad intelectual y a título gratuito, una licencia de ámbito mundial no exclusiva que incluye los derechos siguientes: 
 
Derecho de reproducción, distribución y comunicación pública de la obra o la prestación. 
Derecho a incorporar la obra o la prestación en una o más colecciones. 
Derecho de reproducción, distribución y comunicación pública de la obra o la prestación lícitamente incorporada en una colección. 
Derecho de transformación de la obra para crear una obra derivada siempre y cuando se incluya en ésta una indicación de la transformación o modificación efectuada. 
Derecho de reproducción, distribución y comunicación pública de obras derivadas creadas a partir de la obra licenciada. 
Derecho a extraer y reutilizar la obra o la prestación de una base de datos. 
Para evitar cualquier duda, el titular originario: 
Conserva el derecho a percibir las remuneraciones o compensaciones previstas por actos de explotación de la obra o prestación, calificadas por la ley como irrenunciables e inalienables y sujetas a gestión colectiva obligatoria. 
Renuncia al derecho exclusivo a percibir, tanto individualmente como mediante una entidad de gestión colectiva de derechos, cualquier remuneración derivada de actos de explotación de la obra o prestación que usted realice. 
Estos derechos se pueden ejercitar en todos los medios y formatos, tangibles o intangibles, conocidos en el momento de la concesión de esta licencia. Los derechos mencionados incluyen el derecho a efectuar las modificaciones que sean precisas técnicamente para el ejercicio de los derechos en otros medios y formatos. Todos los derechos no concedidos expresamente por el licenciador quedan reservados, incluyendo, a título enunciativo pero no limitativo, los derechos morales irrenunciables reconocidos por la ley aplicable. En la medida en que el licenciador ostente derechos exclusivos previstos por la ley nacional vigente que implementa la directiva europea en materia de derecho sui generis sobre bases de datos, renuncia expresamente a dichos derechos exclusivos. 
 
4. Restricciones. La concesión de derechos que supone esta licencia se encuentra sujeta y limitada a las restricciones siguientes: 
 
Usted puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra o prestación solamente bajo los términos de esta licencia y debe incluir una copia de la misma, o su Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI). Usted no puede ofrecer o imponer ninguna condición sobre la obra o prestación que altere o restrinja los términos de esta licencia o el ejercicio de sus derechos por parte de los concesionarios de la misma. Usted no puede sublicenciar la obra o prestación. Usted debe mantener intactos todos los avisos que se refieran a esta licencia y a la ausencia de garantías. Usted no puede reproducir, distribuir o comunicar públicamente la obra o prestación con medidas tecnológicas que controlen el acceso o el uso de una manera contraria a los términos de esta licencia. Esta sección 4.a también afecta a la obra o prestación incorporada en una colección, pero ello no implica que ésta en su conjunto quede automáticamente o deba quedar sujeta a los términos de la misma. En el caso que le sea requerido, previa comunicación del licenciador, si usted incorpora la obra en una colección y/o crea una obra derivada, deberá quitar cualquier crédito requerido en el apartado 4.b, en la medida de lo posible. 
Si usted reproduce, distribuye o comunica públicamente la obra o la prestación, una colección que la incorpore o cualquier obra derivada, debe mantener intactos todos los avisos sobre la propiedad intelectual e indicar, de manera razonable conforme al medio o a los medios que usted esté utilizando: 
El nombre del autor original, o el seudónimo si es el caso, así como el del titular originario, si le es facilitado. 
El nombre de aquellas partes (por ejemplo: institución, publicación, revista) que el titular originario y/o el licenciador designen para ser reconocidos en el aviso legal, las condiciones de uso, o de cualquier otra manera razonable. 
El título de la obra o la prestación si le es facilitado. 
El URI, si existe, que el licenciador especifique para ser vinculado a la obra o la prestación, a menos que tal URI no se refiera al aviso legal o a la información sobre la licencia de la obra o la prestación. 
En el caso de una obra derivada, un aviso que identifique la transformación de la obra en la obra derivada (p. ej., "traducción castellana de la obra de Autor Original," o "guión basado en obra original de Autor Original"). 
Este reconocimiento debe hacerse de manera razonable. En el caso de una obra derivada o incorporación en una colección estos créditos deberán aparecer como mínimo en el mismo lugar donde se hallen los correspondientes a otros autores o titulares y de forma comparable a los mismos. Para evitar la duda, los créditos requeridos en esta sección sólo serán utilizados a efectos de atribución de la obra o la prestación en la manera especificada anteriormente. Sin un permiso previo por escrito, usted no puede afirmar ni dar a entender implícitamente ni explícitamente ninguna conexión, patrocinio o aprobación por parte del titular originario, el licenciador y/o las partes reconocidas hacia usted o hacia el uso que hace de la obra o la prestación. 
Para evitar cualquier duda, debe hacerse notar que las restricciones anteriores (párrafos 4.a y 4.b) no son de aplicación a aquellas partes de la obra o la prestación objeto de esta licencia que únicamente puedan ser protegidas mediante el derecho sui generis sobre bases de datos recogido por la ley nacional vigente implementando la directiva europea de bases de datos 
5. Exoneración de responsabilidad 
 
A MENOS QUE SE ACUERDE MUTUAMENTE ENTRE LAS PARTES, EL LICENCIADOR OFRECE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN TAL CUAL (ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS) Y NO CONFIERE NINGUNA GARANTÍA DE CUALQUIER TIPO RESPECTO DE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN O DE LA PRESENCIA O AUSENCIA DE ERRORES QUE PUEDAN O NO SER DESCUBIERTOS. ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE TALES GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PUEDE NO SER DE APLICACIÓN A USTED. 
 
6. Limitación de responsabilidad. SALVO QUE LO DISPONGA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE LA LEY APLICABLE, EN NINGÚN CASO EL LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSABLE ANTE USTED POR CUALESQUIERA DAÑOS RESULTANTES, GENERALES O ESPECIALES (INCLUIDO EL DAÑO EMERGENTE Y EL LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUITOS O CAUSALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENCIA O EL USO DE LA OBRA O LA PRESTACIÓN, INCLUSO SI EL LICENCIADOR HUBIERA SIDO INFORMADO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE TALES DAÑOS. 
 
7. Finalización de la licencia 
 
Esta licencia y la concesión de los derechos que contiene terminarán automáticamente en caso de cualquier incumplimiento de los términos de la misma. Las personas o entidades que hayan recibido de usted obras derivadas o colecciones bajo esta licencia, sin embargo, no verán sus licencias finalizadas, siempre que tales personas o entidades se mantengan en el cumplimiento íntegro de esta licencia. Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 y 8 permanecerán vigentes pese a cualquier finalización de esta licencia. 
Conforme a las condiciones y términos anteriores, la concesión de derechos de esta licencia es vigente por todo el plazo de protección de los derechos de propiedad intelectual según la ley aplicable. A pesar de lo anterior, el licenciador se reserva el derecho a divulgar o publicar la obra o la prestación en condiciones distintas a las presentes, o de retirar la obra o la prestación en cualquier momento. No obstante, ello no supondrá dar por concluida esta licencia (o cualquier otra licencia que haya sido concedida, o sea necesario ser concedida, bajo los términos de esta licencia), que continuará vigente y con efectos completos a no ser que haya finalizado conforme a lo establecido anteriormente, sin perjuicio del derecho moral de arrepentimiento en los términos reconocidos por la ley de propiedad intelectual aplicable.

Licenza 
 
A OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN (SEGUNDO SE DEFINE MÁIS ADIANTE) PROPORCIONASE BAIXO OS TERMOS DESTA LICENZA PÚBLICA DE CREATIVE COMMONS (CCPL OU LICENZA). A OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN ESTÁ PROTEXIDA POLA LEI ESPAÑOLA DE PROPIEDADE INTELECTUAL E/OU CALQUERA OUTRA NORMA QUE RESULTE DE APLICACIÓN. ESTÁ PROHIBIDO CALQUERA USO DA OBRA OU PRESTACIÓN DIFERENTE AO AUTORIZADO POR ESTA LICENZA OU AO DISPOSTO NA LEI DE PROPIEDADE INTELECTUAL. 
 
POR MEDIO DO EXERCICIO DE CALQUERA DEREITO SOBRE A OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN, VOSTEDE ACEPTA E CONSENTE AS LIMITACIÓNS E OBRIGAS DESTA LICENZA, SEN PREXUÍZO DA NECESIDADE DE CONSENTIMENTO EXPRESO EN CASO DE VIOLACIÓN PREVIA DOS SEUS TERMOS. O LICENCIADOR CÉDELLE OS DEREITOS CONTIDOS NESTA LICENZA, SEMPRE QUE VOSTEDE ACEPTE OS PRESENTES TERMOS E CONDICIÓNS. 
 
1. Definicións 
 
A obra é a creación literaria, artística ou científica ofrecida nos termos desta licenza. 
Nesta licenza considérase unha prestación calquera interpretación, execución, fonograma, gravación audiovisual, emisión ou transmisión, simple fotografía ou outros obxectos protexidos pola lexislación de propiedade intelectual vixente aplicábel. 
A aplicación desta licenza a unha colección (definida máis adiante) afectaralle unicamente á súa estrutura en canto forma de expresión da selección ou disposición dos seus contidos, mais non é extensiva a estes. Neste caso a colección terá a consideración de obra para os efectos desta licenza. 
O titular orixinario é: 
No caso dunha obra literaria, artística ou científica, a persoa natural ou grupo de persoas que creou a obra. 
No caso dunha obra colectiva, a persoa que a edite e divulgue baixo o seu nome, salvo pacto contrario. 
No caso dunha interpretación ou execución, o actor, cantante, músico, ou calquera outra persoa que represente, cante, lea, recite, interprete ou execute de calquera forma unha obra. 
No caso dun fonograma, o produtor fonográfico, é dicir, a persoa natural ou xurídica baixo a iniciativa e responsabilidade da cal se realiza por primeira vez unha fixación exclusivamente sonora da execución dunha obra ou doutros sons. 
No caso dunha gravación audiovisual, o produtor da gravación, é dicir, a persoa natural ou xurídica que teña a iniciativa e asuma a responsabilidade das fixacións dun plano ou secuencia de imaxes, con ou sen son. 
No caso dunha emisión ou dunha transmisión, a entidade de radiodifusión. 
No caso dunha simple fotografía, aquela persoa que a realizou. 
No caso doutros obxectos protexidos pola lexislación de propiedade intelectual vixente, a persoa que esta indique. 
Consideraranse obras derivadas aquelas obras creadas a partir da licenciada, como por exemplo: as traducións e adaptacións; as revisións, actualizacións e anotacións; os compendios, resumos e extractos; os arranxos musicais e, en xeral, calquera transformación dunha obra literaria, artística ou científica. Para evitar a dúbida, se a obra consiste nunha composición musical ou gravación de sons, a sincronización temporal da obra cunha imaxe en movemento (synching) será considerada como unha obra derivada para os efectos desta licenza. 
Terán a consideración de coleccións a compilación de obras alleas, de datos ou doutros elementos independentes como as antoloxías e as bases de datos que pola selección ou disposición dos seus contidos constitúan creacións intelectuais. A simple incorporación dunha obra nunha colección non dará lugar a unha derivada para os efectos desta licenza. 
O licenciador é a persoa ou a entidade que ofrece a obra ou prestación nos termos desta licenza e lle concede os seus dereitos de explotación conforme o disposto nela. 
Vostede é a persoa ou a entidade que exerce os dereitos concedidos mediante esta licenza e que non violou previamente os seus termos con respecto á obra ou á prestación, ou que recibiu o permiso expreso do licenciador para exercer os dereitos concedidos mediante esta licenza a pesar dunha violación anterior. 
A transformación dunha obra comprende a súa tradución, adaptación e calquera outra modificación na súa forma da que se derive unha obra diferente. A creación resultante da transformación dunha obra terá a consideración de obra derivada. 
Enténdese por reprodución a fixación directa ou indirecta, provisional ou permanente, por calquera medio e en calquera forma, de toda a obra ou a prestación ou de parte dela, que permita a súa comunicación ou a obtención de copias. 
Enténdese por distribución a posta a disposición do público do orixinal ou das copias da obra ou da prestación, nun soporte tanxible, mediante a súa venda, alugueiro, préstamo ou de calquera outra forma. 
Enténdese por comunicación pública todo acto polo cal unha pluralidade de persoas, que non pertenzan ao ámbito doméstico de quen a leva a cabo, poida ter acceso á obra ou á prestación sen previa distribución de exemplares a cada unha delas. Considérase comunicación pública a posta a disposición do público de obras ou prestacións por procedementos con fíos ou sen fíos, de tal forma que calquera persoa poida acceder a elas dende o lugar e no momento que elixa. 
A explotación da obra ou a prestación comprende a reprodución, a distribución, a comunicación pública e, no seu caso, a transformación. 
2. Límites dos dereitos. Nada nesta licenza pretende reducir ou restrinxir calquera dos límites legais dos dereitos exclusivos do titular dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual de acordo coa Lei de Propiedade Intelectual ou calquera outra lei aplicábel, xa sexan derivados de usos lexítimos, tales como a copia privada ou a cita, ou outras limitacións como o resultante da primeira venda de exemplares (esgotamento). 
 
3. Concesión de licenza. Conforme os termos e ás condicións desta licenza, o licenciador concede, polo prazo de protección dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual e a título gratuíto, unha licenza de ámbito mundial non exclusiva que inclúe os seguintes dereitos: 
 
Dereito de reprodución, distribución e comunicación pública da obra ou da prestación. 
Dereito a incorporar a obra ou a prestación nunha ou máis coleccións. 
Dereito de reprodución, distribución e comunicación pública da obra ou da prestación licitamente incorporada nunha colección. 
Dereito de transformación da obra para crear unha obra derivada sempre e cando se inclúa nesta unha indicación da transformación ou modificación efectuada. 
Dereito de reprodución, distribución e comunicación pública de obras derivadas creadas a partir da obra licenciada. 
Dereito a extraer e reutilizar a obra ou a prestación dunha base de datos. 
Para evitar calquera dúbida, o titular orixinario: 
Conserva o dereito a percibir as remuneracións ou compensacións previstas por actos de explotación da obra ou prestación, cualificadas pola lei como irrenunciábeis e inalienábeis e suxeitas a xestión colectiva obrigatoria. 
Renuncia ao dereito exclusivo a percibir, tanto individualmente como mediante unha entidade de xestión colectiva de dereitos, calquera remuneración derivada de actos de explotación da obra ou prestación que vostede realice. 
Estes dereitos pódense exercer en todos os medios e formatos, tanxíbeis ou intanxíbeis, coñecidos no momento da concesión desta licenza. Os dereitos mencionados inclúen o dereito a efectuar as modificacións que sexan precisas tecnicamente para o exercicio dos dereitos noutros medios e formatos. Todos os dereitos non concedidos expresamente polo licenciador quedan reservados, incluíndo a título enunciativo pero non limitativo, os dereitos morais irrenunciábeis recoñecidos pola lei aplicábel. Na medida en que o licenciador teña dereitos exclusivos previstos pola lei nacional vixente que implementa a directiva europea en materia de dereito sui generis sobre bases de datos, renuncia expresamente aos devanditos dereitos exclusivos. 
 
4. Restricións. A concesión de dereitos que supón esta licenza atópase suxeita e limitada ás restricións seguintes: 
 
Vostede pode reproducir, distribuír ou comunicar publicamente a obra ou prestación soamente baixo os termos desta licenza e debe incluír unha copia dela, ou o seu Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI). Vostede non pode ofrecer ou impoñer ningunha condición sobre a obra ou prestación que altere ou restrinxa os termos desta licenza ou o exercicio dos seus dereitos por parte dos seus concesionarios. Vostede non pode sublicenciar a obra ou prestación. Vostede debe manter intactos todos os avisos que se refiran a esta licenza e á ausencia de garantías. Vostede non pode reproducir, distribuír ou comunicar publicamente a obra ou prestación con medidas tecnolóxicas que controlen o acceso ou o uso dun xeito contrario aos termos desta licenza. Esta sección 4.a tamén afecta á obra ou prestación incorporada nunha colección, pero iso non implica que esta no seu conxunto quede automaticamente ou deba quedar suxeita aos seus termos. No caso que lle sexa requirido, logo de comunicación do licenciador, se vostede incorpora a obra nunha colección e/ou crea unha obra derivada, deberá quitar calquera crédito requirido no apartado 4.b, na medida do posíbel. 
Se vostede reproduce, distribúe ou comunica publicamente a obra ou a prestación, unha colección que a incorpore ou calquera obra derivada, debe manter intactos todos os avisos sobre a propiedade intelectual e indicar, de xeito razoábel conforme ao medio ou aos medios que vostede estea a empregar: 
O nome do autor orixinal, ou o pseudónimo se é o caso, así como o do titular orixinario, se lle é facilitado. 
O nome daquelas partes (por exemplo: institución, publicación, revista) que o titular orixinario e/ou o licenciador designen para ser recoñecidos no aviso legal, as condicións de uso, ou de calquera outro xeito razoábel. 
O título da obra ou da prestación se lle é facilitado. 
O URI, se existe, que o licenciador especifique para ser vinculado á obra ou á prestación, a menos que tal URI non se refira ao aviso legal ou á información sobre a licenza da obra ou a prestación. 
No caso dunha obra derivada, un aviso que identifique a transformación da obra na obra derivada (p. ex., "tradución galega da obra de Autor Orixinal, ou "guión baseado en obra orixinal de Autor Orixinal"). 
Este recoñecemento debe facerse de xeito razoábel. No caso dunha obra derivada ou incorporación nunha colección estes créditos deberán aparecer como mínimo no mesmo lugar onde se achen os correspondentes a outros autores ou titulares e de forma comparábel a estes. Para evitar a dúbida, os créditos requiridos nesta sección só serán empregados para os efectos de atribución da obra ou a prestación no xeito especificado anteriormente. Sen un permiso previo por escrito, vostede non pode afirmar nin dar a entender implicitamente nin explicitamente ningunha conexión, patrocinio ou aprobación por parte do titular orixinario, o licenciador e/ou as partes recoñecidas cara a vostede ou cara ao uso que fai da obra ou a prestación. 
Para evitar calquera dúbida, debe facerse notar que as restricións anteriores (parágrafos 4.a e 4.b) non son de aplicación a aquelas partes da obra ou a prestación obxecto desta licenza que unicamente poidan ser protexidas mediante o dereito sui generis sobre bases de datos recollido pola lei nacional vixente que transpoña a directiva europea de bases de datos. 
5. Ausencia de responsabilidade 
 
SALVO QUE SE CONVEÑA MUTUAMENTE DOUTRO XEITO POLAS PARTES, O LICENCIADOR OFRECE A OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN TAL CAL (ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS) E NON CONFIRE NINGUNHA GARANTÍA DE NINGÚN TIPO RESPECTO DA OBRA OU DA PRESTACIÓN OU DA PRESENZA OU AUSENCIA DE ERROS QUE POIDAN OU NON SER DESCUBERTOS. ALGUNHAS XURISDICIÓNS NON PERMITEN A EXCLUSIÓN DAS DITAS GARANTÍAS, POLO QUE TAL EXCLUSIÓN PODE NON SERLLE DE APLICACIÓN A VOSTEDE. 
 
6. Limitación de responsabilidade. SALVO QUE O DISPOÑA EXPRESA E IMPERATIVAMENTE A LEI APLICÁBEL, EN NINGÚN CASO O LICENCIADOR SERÁ RESPONSÁBEL ANTE VOSTEDE POR CALQUERA DANO RESULTANTE, XERAL OU ESPECIAL (INCLUÍDO O DANO EMERXENTE E O LUCRO CESANTE), FORTUÍTOS OU CAUSAIS, DIRECTOS OU INDIRECTOS, PRODUCIDOS EN CONEXIÓN CON ESTA LICENZA OU O USO DA OBRA OU A PRESTACIÓN, MESMO SE O LICENCIADOR FOSE INFORMADO DA POSIBILIDADE DE TALES DANOS. 
 
7. Finalización da licenza 
 
Esta licenza e a concesión dos dereitos que contén rematarán automaticamente en caso de calquera incumprimento dos seus termos. As persoas ou entidades que recibiran de vostede obras derivadas ou coleccións baixo esta licenza, non obstante, non verán as súas licenzas finalizadas, sempre que tales persoas ou entidades se manteñan no cumprimento íntegro desta licenza. As seccións 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 permanecerán vixentes malia calquera finalización desta licenza. 
Conforme ás condicións e termos anteriores, a concesión de dereitos desta licenza é vixente por todo o prazo de protección dos dereitos de propiedade intelectual segundo a lei aplicábel. Malia o anterior, o licenciador resérvase o dereito a divulgar ou publicar a obra ou a prestación en condicións distintas ás presentes, ou de retirar a obra ou a prestación en calquera momento. Non obstante, iso non suporá dar por concluída esta licenza (ou calquera outra licenza que fose concedida, ou sexa necesario ser concedida, baixo os termos desta licenza), que continuará vixente e con efectos completos a non ser que finalizara conforme ao establecido anteriormente, sen prexuízo do dereito moral de arrepentimento nos termos recoñecidos pola Lei de Propiedade Intelectual aplicábel. 
8. Miscelánea 
 
Cada vez que vostede realice calquera tipo de explotación da obra ou a prestación, ou dunha colección que a incorpore, o licenciador ofrece aos terceiros e sucesivos licenciatarios a concesión de dereitos sobre a obra ou a prestación nas mesmas condicións e termos que a licenza concedida a vostede. 
Cada vez que vostede realice calquera tipo de explotación dunha obra derivada, o licenciador ofrécelle aos terceiros e sucesivos licenciatarios a concesión de dereitos sobre a obra obxecto desta licenza nas mesmas condicións e termos que a licenza concedida a vostede. 
Se algunha disposición desta licenza resulta inválida ou inaplicábel segundo a Lei vixente, iso non afectará a validez ou aplicabilidade do resto dos termos desta licenza e, sen ningunha acción adicional por calquera das partes deste acordo, tal disposición entenderase reformada no estritamente necesario para facer que tal disposición sexa válida e executiva. 
Non se entenderá que existe renuncia respecto de ningún termo ou disposición desta licenza, nin que se consente ningunha violación desta, a menos que tal renuncia ou consentimento figure por escrito e leve a sinatura da parte que renuncie ou consinta. 
Esta licenza constitúe o acordo pleno entre as partes con respecto á obra ou a prestación obxecto da licenza. Non caben interpretacións, acordos ou condicións con respecto á obra ou a prestación que non se atopen expresamente especificados na presente licenza. O licenciador non estará obrigado por ningunha disposición complementaria que poida aparecer en calquera comunicación que faga chegar vostede. Esta licenza non se pode modificar sen o mutuo acordo por escrito entre o licenciador e vostede. 
Aviso de Creative Commons 
 
Creative Commons non é parte desta licenza, e non ofrece ningunha garantía en relación coa obra ou a prestación. Creative Commons non será responsábel fronte a vostede ou a calquera parte, por calquera danos resultantes, incluíndo, pero non limitando danos xerais ou especiais (incluído o dano emerxente e o lucro cesante), fortuítos ou causais, en conexión con esta licenza. Malia as dúas (2) oracións anteriores, se Creative Commons se identificou expresamente como o licenciador, terá todos os dereitos e obrigas do licenciador.

L'ŒUVRE EST PROTEGEE PAR LE DROIT DE LA PROPRIETE LITTERAIRE ET ARTISTIQUE OU TOUTE AUTRE LOI APPLICABLE. TOUTE UTILISATION DE L'ŒUVRE AUTRE QUE CELLE AUTORISEE PAR CETTE LICENCE EST RÉSERVÉE.
L’EXERCICE DE TOUT DROIT SUR L’ŒUVRE MISE A DISPOSITION EMPORTE ACCEPTATION DES TERMES DE LA LICENCE. EN RAISON DU CARACTERE CONTRACTUEL DE LA LICENCE, L’OFFRANT ACCORDE A L’ACCEPTANT LES DROITS CONTENUS DANS CETTE LICENCE EN CONTREPARTIE DE SON ACCEPTATION.
1. Définitions
Adaptation : œuvre créée soit à partir de l’Œuvre seule, soit à partir de l’Œuvre et d’autres œuvres préexistantes. Constituent notamment des Adaptations, les traductions, adaptations, œuvres composites, arrangements ou modifications d’une œuvre littéraire et artistique, d’un phonogramme, d’un vidéogramme ou d’une interprétation d’une œuvre, y compris les adaptations cinématographiques ou toute autre forme dans laquelle l’Œuvre est susceptible d’être refondue, transformée ou adaptée, notamment toute forme dérivée de l’original de manière identifiable. Il est toutefois entendu qu’une Œuvre qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence. Au cas où l’Œuvre serait une création musicale, une interprétation ou un phonogramme, la synchronisation de l’Œuvre avec une image animée sera considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence.
Collection : recueil d’œuvres qui, en raison de la sélection et de l’arrangement de son contenu, constitue une création intellectuelle dans laquelle chaque Œuvre se trouve incluse dans son ensemble, sous une forme non modifiée, avec une ou plusieurs autres contributions, chacune d’elles constituant des œuvres en elles-mêmes indépendantes et distinctes qui sont rassemblées pour former cet ensemble. Constituent notamment des Collections, les encyclopédies, anthologies, interprétations, phonogrammes, vidéogrammes ou émissions, ou toute œuvre autre que celles désignées à l’article 1(f). Aux fins de la présente Licence, une création qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation (telle que définie ci-dessus).
Distribution : mise à disposition du public de la version originale ou des copies de l'Œuvre ou d'une Adaptation, par la vente ou tout autre transfert de propriété ou par tout mode de communication au public dans la mesure où ces activités sont sources de droits exclusifs (location, prêt, etc).

Titulaire de Droits Originaire : dans l’hypothèse d’une œuvre littéraire ou artistique, l’Auteur, entendu comme la ou les personnes physiques ou morales ou les entités qui ont créé l'Œuvre; et en outre, le cas échéant, (i) dans l’hypothèse d’une interprétation, les acteurs, chanteurs, musiciens, danseurs, ou toute autre personne qui joue, chante, déclame ou interprète l’œuvre littéraire, artistique ou folklorique; (ii) dans l’hypothèse d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme, le producteur, entendu comme la personne physique ou morale qui procède à la première fixation de l’interprétation sur un support; (iii) dans l’hypothèse d’une émission, l’entreprise de communication audiovisuelle qui procède à la diffusion de l’émission; (iv) dans l’hypothèse d’une base de données, le producteur.

Acceptant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou entité(s) qui exercent sur l’Œuvre les droits accordés par cette Licence et qui n’ont pas précédemment violé les conditions de cette Licence ou qui ont reçu l’autorisation expresse de la part de l’Offrant d’exercer les droits conférés par cette licence malgré une violation précédente.
Représentation : représentation de l’Œuvre et communications au public de ces représentations publiques par un procédé quelconque, quelque soit le type de transmission, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d’exploitation prévus par le droit applicable.

2. Exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs. Les exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs prévues par la loi applicable ne sont pas affectées par la présente Licence.
3. Étendue de l’autorisation. Sous réserve des conditions de la présente Licence, l’Offrant autorise l’Acceptant à exercer à titre gratuit, non-exclusif, pour la durée de protection des droits applicables et pour le monde entier, les droits de :
Reproduire, Distribuer et Représenter l'Œuvre, incorporer l'Œuvre dans une ou plusieurs Collections et reproduire l'Œuvre même incorporée dans lesdites Collections ;
Créer, Reproduire, Distribuer et Représenter des Adaptations, à la condition que ces Adaptations, notamment toute traduction sur tout support, soient accompagnées des mentions appropriées par étiquetage, démarcation ou identification de manière à faire apparaître clairement que des modifications ont été apportées à l’Œuvre. Par exemple, une traduction pourrait porter la mention « L’œuvre originaire a été traduite du français à l’anglais » ou en cas de modification « L’œuvre originaire a été modifiée » ;
Lorsque l'Œuvre est une base de données soumise au droit des producteurs de bases de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté :
Régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire.  Dans les cas où des utilisations de l'Œuvre seraient soumises à un régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire (auquel le droit ne permet pas de renoncer), l'Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances par l'intermédiaire de la société de perception et de répartition des droits compétente. Sont notamment concernés la radiodiffusion et la communication dans un lieu public de phonogrammes publiés à des fins de commerce, certains cas de retransmission par câble et satellite, la copie privée d'Œuvres fixées sur phonogrammes ou vidéogrammes, la reproduction par reprographie, le prêt en bibliothèque ;
Régime de gestion collective obligatoire assorti de possibilité de renonciation.  Dans les juridictions où il est possible de renoncer au droit de percevoir des redevances au titre d'un quelconque régime de licence légale ou de gestion collective obligatoire, l’Offrant renonce au droit exclusif de percevoir lesdites redevances découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits consentis en vertu de la présente Licence ;
Régime de gestion collective facultative.  L’Offrant renonce au droit de percevoir des redevances (que ce soit à titre individuel ou, au cas où l’Offrant serait membre d’un organisme de gestion collective facultative, par le biais de cet organisme) découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits accordés par la présente Licence.
Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous supports, médias, procédés, techniques et dans tous formats, incluant, dans la mesure du possible, les futurs médias et formats. Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus incluent le droit d'effectuer les modifications techniquement nécessaires à leur exercice sur d’autres supports, médias, procédés, techniques et formats. Les droits qui ne sont pas expressément accordés par l’Offrant à l’Acceptant par la présente Licence sont réservés. Dans le cas où l'Offrant est titulaire de droits sui generis sur les bases de données conformément à la loi nationale transposant la Directive Européenne sur les bases de données, l'Offrant renonce à ce droit.
4. Restrictions. L'autorisation accordée par l'Article 3 est expressément soumise et limitée par les restrictions suivantes :
L'Acceptant peut Distribuer ou Représenter l'Œuvre uniquement selon les termes de cette licence. Il doit inclure une copie de la Licence, ou son Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource (URI), à toute copie de l'Œuvre qu'il Distribue ou Représente. L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation sur l'Œuvre qui restreignent les termes de la Licence ou la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur d'exercer les droits qui lui sont accordés par cette Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut consentir de sous-licence sur l'Œuvre. Il doit conserver intacts tous les avertissements qui se réfèrent à cette Licence et l’avertissement sur les garanties avec chaque copie de l’Œuvre qu’il distribue ou représente. Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre, il ne doit pas imposer de mesure technique de protection susceptible de restreindre la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur à exercer les droits conférés par la présente Licence. L’article 4(a) s’applique à l’Œuvre telle qu’incorporée dans une Collection, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que la Collection soit soumise aux conditions de la Licence. Si l'Acceptant crée une Collection, il doit, à la demande de tout Offrant et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de la Collection toute référence audit Offrant, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(b), et ce conformément à la demande. Si l'Acceptant crée une Adaptation, il doit, à la demande de tout Offrant et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de l'Adaptation toute référence audit Offrant, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(b), et ce conformément à la demande.
Sauf introduction d’une demande prévue à l’Article 4(a), l'Acceptant doit, lorsqu'il distribue ou représente l'Œuvre, ou toute Adaptation ou Collection, garder intacts tous les avertissements sur les droits d’auteur concernant l’Œuvre et fournir, de manière appropriée au support ou au média qu'il utilise : (i) le nom du Titulaire de Droits Originaire (ou le pseudonyme, le cas échéant) s'il est mentionné, et/ou si le Titulaire de Droits Originaire et/ou l’Offrant désigne une ou des parties (par exemple un organisme de financement, un éditeur ou un journal) à attribuer (« les Parties à Attribuer ») dans l’avertissement sur les droits d’auteur de l’Offrant, les conditions d’utilisation ou, par un autre moyen approprié, le nom de la Partie ou des Parties à Attribuer ; (ii) le titre de l’Œuvre, s’il est mentionné ; (iii) dans la mesure du possible, l’URI que l'Offrant spécifie comme étant associée à l’Œuvre, sauf si ledit URI ne fait pas référence à l’avertissement sur les droits ou aux informations sur la licence relative à l’Œuvre ; et, (iv) conformément à l’Article 3(b), dans le cas d’une Adaptation, une mention identifiant l’utilisation de l'Œuvre dans l’Adaptation (par exemple « traduction française de l’Œuvre par le Titulaire de Droits Originaire » ou « scénario fondé sur l’Œuvre du Titulaire de Droits Originaire »). Les crédits requis par cet article 4(b) pourront être mis en œuvre par tout moyen approprié, sous réserve, toutefois, qu’en cas d’Adaptation ou de Collection, ces crédits figurent d’une manière au moins aussi visible que les crédits relatifs aux autres auteurs y ayant contribué, si de tels crédits apparaissent. A toutes fins utiles, l'Acceptant ne pourra utiliser les crédits requis par cet Article qu'à des fins d’attribution, de la manière susmentionnée et en exerçant les droits accordés par la Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut, implicitement ou explicitement, affirmer ou laisser supposer une quelconque relation, parrainage ou aval par le Titulaire de Droits Originaire, l'Offrant, la ou les Parties à Attribuer selon le cas, et l’Acceptant ou son utilisation de l’Œuvre, sans avoir l’autorisation distincte, expresse, écrite et préalable du Titulaire de Droits Originaire, de l'Offrant et/ou des Parties à Attribuer.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les restrictions accordées par l’article 3 et l'article 4(a) ne sont pas applicables à la partie de l’œuvre qui est soumise uniquement aux droits des producteurs de bases de données.
A moins d’une limitation aux droits exclusifs prévue par la loi applicable, si l’Acceptant Reproduit, Distribue ou Représente l’Œuvre en elle-même, ou au sein d’une Adaptation ou d’une Collection, il doit respecter les droits moraux du Titulaire de Droits Originaire dans la mesure où ce Titulaire en bénéficie (comme les auteurs et les artistes-interprètes) et ne peut y renoncer.
5. Représentation, Garanties et Avertissement
SAUF ACCORD CONTRAIRE CONVENU PAR ECRIT ENTRE LES PARTIES ET DANS LA LIMITE DU DROIT APPLICABLE, L’OFFRANT MET L’ŒUVRE A DISPOSITION DE L’ACCEPTANT EN L’ETAT, SANS DECLARATION OU GARANTIE D’AUCUNE SORTE, EXPRESSE, IMPLICITE, LÉGALE OU AUTRE. SONT NOTAMMENT EXCLUES LES GARANTIES CONCERNANT LA COMMERCIABILITE, LA CONFORMITE, LES VICES CACHES ET LES VICES APPARENTS.
6. Limitation de responsabilité. A l'exception des garanties d'ordre public imposées par la loi applicable, l'Offrant ne sera en aucun cas tenu responsable vis-à-vis de l'Acceptant, sur la base d'aucune théorie juridique ni en raison d'aucun préjudice direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, résultant de l'exécution du présent Contrat ou de l'utilisation de l'Œuvre, y compris dans l'hypothèse où l'Offrant avait connaissance de la possible existence d'un tel préjudice.
7. Résiliation
Toute violation par l'Acceptant des clauses de cette Licence entraînera sa résiliation automatique et la fin des droits qui en découlent. Les Licences accordées aux personnes physiques ou morales qui ont reçu de la part de l'Acceptant des Adaptations ou des Collections dans le cadre de la présente Licence ne seront pas résiliées, à condition que lesdites personnes physiques ou morales respectent pleinement leurs obligations. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 de la présente Licence continuent à s'appliquer après la résiliation de celle-ci.
Sous réserve des conditions mentionnées ci-dessus, la présente Licence est accordée pour toute la durée du droit d'auteur ou tout autre droit applicable à l'Œuvre. Néanmoins, l'Offrant se réserve à tout moment le droit d'exploiter l'Œuvre sous une autre Licence ou d'en cesser la Distribution à tout moment. Cependant, cette décision ne devra pas conduire à retirer cette Licence (ou toute autre Licence qui a été accordée, ou doit être accordée en application de la présente Licence) qui continuera à s'appliquer dans tous ses effets à moins qu'elle ne soit résiliée dans les conditions décrites ci-dessus.
8. Divers
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre ou une Collection, l’Offrant accorde au bénéficiaire suivant, une licence sur l’Œuvre avec les mêmes termes et conditions que celle accordée à l’Acceptant.
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente une Adaptation, l’Offrant accorde au bénéficiaire une licence sur l’œuvre dans des conditions identiques à celles accordées à l’Acceptant.
Si en vertu de la loi applicable, une quelconque disposition de la présente Licence était déclarée nulle, non valide ou inapplicable, cela n'aurait pas pour effet d'annuler ou de rendre inapplicables les autres dispositions de la Licence. Sans action ultérieure des parties, ladite disposition sera modifiée dans la mesure minimum nécessaire à sa validité et son applicabilité.
Aucune des conditions ou des dispositions de la présente Licence ne sera réputée comme ayant fait l'objet d'une renonciation, et aucune violation comme ayant été acceptée, sans le consentement écrit et signé de la partie concernée.
La présente Licence représente l'intégralité de l'accord conclu entre les parties à propos de l'Œuvre, objet de la présente Licence. Il n'existe aucun élément annexe, accord ou mandat portant sur cette Œuvre qui ne soit mentionné ci-dessus. L'Offrant ne sera tenu par aucune disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une communication provenant de l'Acceptant. La présente Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord écrit de l'Offrant et de l'Acceptant.

1. Ορισμοί
α.
«Παράγωγο Έργο (Τροποποίηση)» σημαίνει ένα έργο βασισμένο στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης ή στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης και σε άλλα υφιστάμενα έργα, όπως μια μετάφραση, διασκευή, δημιουργία παραγώγου έργου, μουσική διασκευή ή άλλη τροποποίηση συγγραφικού ή καλλιτεχνικού έργου, ηχητική έκδοση (φωνογράφημα) ή δραματοποίηση, και περιέχει έκδοση κινηματογραφικής ταινίας (οπτικοακουστικό έργο), ή οποιαδήποτε άλλη μορφή με την οποία το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης μπορεί να διασκευασθεί, μετατραπεί ή να προσαρμοσθεί σε οποιαδήποτε μορφή που εύλογα προέρχεται από την αρχική, εκτός όταν πρόκειται για Συλλογικό Έργο που δεν μπορεί να θεωρηθεί Παράγωγο Έργο για το σκοπό της Άδειας αυτής. Προς αποφυγή αμφιβολιών, όπου το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης είναι μουσική σύνθεση ή εγγραφή ήχου (φωνογράφημα), ο συγχρονισμός του αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης με μια κινούμενη εικόνα («συγχρονισμός») θα θεωρείται Παράγωγο Έργο για το σκοπό της Άδειας αυτής.
β.
«Συλλογικό Έργο» σημαίνει μια συλλογή συγγραφικών ή καλλιτεχνικών έργων όπως ανθολογία ή εγκυκλοπαίδεια, ή δραματοποιήσεων, ηχητικών εκδόσεων (φωνογραφήματα) ή αναμεταδόσεων, ή άλλων έργων ή συλλογή έργων άλλων από τα αναφερόμενα στον όρο 1(ζ) της παρούσας Άδειας, ή συλλογή εκφράσεων της λαϊκής παράδοσης ή απλών γεγονότων και στοιχείων, η οποία συλλογή, με κριτήρια την επιλογή και διαρρύθμιση του περιεχομένου της, είναι πρωτότυπη. Στην έννοια του Συλλογικού Έργου συμπεριλαμβάνεται και το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης ως σύνολο σε μη τροποποιημένη μορφή, μαζί με ένα αριθμό άλλων συνεισφορών, που αποτελούν ξεχωριστά και ανεξάρτητα έργα καθ’ αυτά, και συγκεντρώνονται σ’ ένα συλλογικό σύνολο. Ένα έργο που αποτελεί Συλλογικό Έργο δεν θα θεωρείται Παράγωγο Έργο (όπως ορίζεται παραπάνω) για τους σκοπούς της παρούσας Άδειας.
γ.
«Διανομή» σημαίνει τη διάθεση στο κοινό του πρωτότυπου αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης ή αναπαραγωγών του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης ή τροποποιήσεών του, με οποιονδήποτε τρόπο, με πώληση ή οποιαδήποτε άλλη δικαιοπραξία διάθεσης δικαιωμάτων επ’ αυτού.

στ.
«Δικαιούχος Συγγενικών Δικαιωμάτων» σημαίνει (i) ο ηθοποιός, μουσικός, τραγουδιστής, χορωδός, χορευτής, καλλιτέχνης κουκλοθέατρου, καλλιτέχνης θεάτρου σκιών, καλλιτέχνης βαριεττέ, καλλιτέχνης τσίρκου, και οποιοσδήποτε άλλος καλλιτέχνης που στην περίπτωση καλλιτεχνικής παράστασης υποκρίνεται, τραγουδάει, αποδίδει, απαγγέλλει, υποδύεται, μεταφράζει ή με οποιονδήποτε άλλο τρόπο συμμετέχει σε παράσταση φιλολογικών ή καλλιτεχνικών έργων ή εκφράσεων της λαϊκής παράδοσης, (ii) στην περίπτωση εγγραφής ήχου (φωνογράφημα), ο παραγωγός, είτε φυσικό είτε νομικό πρόσωπο, με πρωτοβουλία και ευθύνη του οποίου ενεργείται η πρώτη ηχογράφηση, (iii) στην περίπτωση εγγραφής εικόνας ή εικόνας και ήχου (οπτικοακουστικό έργο) ο παραγωγός, είτε φυσικό είτε νομικό πρόσωπο, με πρωτοβουλία και ευθύνη του οποίου ενεργείται η πρώτη εγγραφή εικόνας με ή χωρίς ήχο, (iv) στην περίπτωση της αναμετάδοσης, το νομικό πρόσωπο που αναμεταδίδει.

Για την εφαρμογή της Άδειας αυτής, το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, ενδεικτικά και όχι περιοριστικά περιλαμβάνει κάθε καλλιτεχνική παράσταση, ηχητική εγγραφή (φωνογράφημα), εγγραφή εικόνας και ήχου (οπτικοακουστικό έργο), αναμετάδοση, ή βάση δεδομένων, σύμφωνα με τους ορισμούς του Ελληνικού νόμου περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας. Ο ορισμός «Αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης» λαμβάνεται υπόψη στο βαθμό που η καλλιτεχνική παράσταση, ηχητική εγγραφή (φωνογράφημα), εγγραφή εικόνας και ήχου (οπτικοακουστικό έργο), αναμετάδοση, ή βάση δεδομένων προστατεύεται από το νόμο στη χώρα της δικαιοδοσίας Σας.
η.

θ.
«Παρουσίαση στο κοινό» σημαίνει η παρουσίαση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης σε κύκλο ευρύτερο από το στενό κύκλο της οικογένειας και του άμεσου κοινωνικού περιβάλλοντος, που γίνεται με οποιονδήποτε τρόπο ή διαδικασία με χρήση ασύρματων ή ενσύρματων υλικών φορέων ή ψηφιακών μέσων και με τρόπο που καθένας από το κοινό μπορεί με ίδια μέσα να έχει πρόσβαση στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης από τον τόπο που επιλέγει.
ι.
«Αναπαραγωγή» σημαίνει η παραγωγή αντιγράφων, προσωρινών ή οριστικών, του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης με οποιονδήποτε τρόπο συμπεριλαμβανομένων των ηχητικών ή τηλεοπτικών εγγραφών και των εγγραφών του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης με σκοπό την παραγωγή ή/και αναπαραγωγή του επί ψηφιακών ή άλλων ηλεκτρονικών υλικών φορέων για τη διατήρησή του.
2. Νόμιμοι περιορισμοί (Exceptions)
Η Άδεια αυτή δεν θίγει με οποιονδήποτε τρόπο τους νόμιμους περιορισμούς του περιουσιακού δικαιώματος και το ηθικό δικαίωμα του δημιουργού βάσει του νόμου για την προστασία της πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας ή άλλων νόμων.
3. Παροχή Άδειας.
Βάσει των όρων και προϋποθέσεων της Άδειας αυτής, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια με το παρόν ιδιωτικό συμφωνητικό Σας παρέχει μια παγκόσμια, χωρίς πληρωμή (πνευματικών ή συγγενικών) δικαιωμάτων, μη αποκλειστική, διαρκή άδεια να ασκείτε τα δικαιώματα στo αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης όπως προσδιορίζεται παρακάτω:
α.
Να αναπαράγετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, να ενσωματώνετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης σε ένα ή περισσότερα Συλλογικά Έργα και να αναπαράγετε το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης που έχει ενσωματωθεί σε Συλλογικά Έργα.
β.
Να δημιουργείτε και αναπαράγετε Παράγωγα Έργα (τροποποιήσεις) του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης υπό την προϋπόθεση ότι οποιαδήποτε τροποποίηση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της μετάφρασής του σε οποιοδήποτε μέσο, εμπεριέχει σαφή ενημέρωση και προσδιορισμό των τροποποιήσεων που έγιναν στο πρωτότυπο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης. Για παράδειγμα, η ενημέρωση για μία μετάφραση μπορεί να έχει τη μορφή «Το πρωτότυπο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης μεταφράστηκε από την Αγγλική στην Ισπανική γλώσσα», ή για μία τροποποίηση μπορεί να έχει τη μορφή «Το πρωτότυπο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης έχει τροποποιηθεί».

στ.
Προς άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, γίνεται δεκτό ότι:
Υποχρεωτικές αδειοδοτήσεις μη δεκτικές παραίτησης: Στην περίπτωση υποχρεωτικών αδειοδοτήσεων στις οποίες δεν είναι δυνατή η παραίτηση (για παράδειγμα, αναφορικά με την είσπραξη αμοιβών για πνευματικά δικαιώματα) ο Χορηγών την Άδεια διατηρεί το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει τέτοιες αμοιβές είτε για εμπορική είτε για μη εμπορική χρήση του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης.
Φορείς Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων: Ο Χορηγών την Άδεια παραιτείται από το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει (είτε ατομικά είτε μέσω Οργανισμού Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων, στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι μέλος τέτοιου φορέα) αμοιβές για πνευματικά δικαιώματα αναφορικά με μη εμπορικές χρήσεις του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης. Ο Χορηγών την Άδεια διατηρεί το δικαίωμα να εισπράττει (είτε ατομικά είτε μέσω Οργανισμού Συλλογικής Διαχείρισης πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων, στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι μέλος τέτοιου φορέα) αμοιβές για πνευματικά δικαιώματα αναφορικά με εμπορικές χρήσεις του αντικειμένου της αδειοδότησης.
Τα ανωτέρω δικαιώματα μπορούν να ασκηθούν με όλα τα τεχνικά μέσα και σε όλους τους υλικούς φορείς ενσωμάτωσης αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Τα ανωτέρω δικαιώματα περιλαμβάνουν το δικαίωμα να γίνονται αυτές οι μετατροπές οι οποίες είναι τεχνικά αναγκαίες για την άσκηση των δικαιωμάτων σε άλλα τεχνικά μέσα και υλικούς φορείς ενσωμάτωσης αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Υπάρχει επιφύλαξη υπέρ του δικαιούχου για όλα τα δικαιώματα που δεν παρέχονται σαφώς από τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, όπως ενδεικτικά και όχι περιοριστικά αναφέρονται τα δικαιώματα της Ρήτρας 4(δ).
Στην περίπτωση που ο Χορηγών την Άδεια είναι δικαιούχος του δικαιώματος ειδικής φύσης (sui generis) του κατασκευαστή βάσης δεδομένων σύμφωνα με τον Ελληνικό νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας, όπως αυτό ισχύει κατ’ εφαρμογή στο Ελληνικό Δίκαιο της Οδηγίας 96/9/ΕΟΚ για τη νομική προστασία των βάσεων δεδομένων, ο Χορηγών την Άδεια παραιτείται αυτού του δικαιώματός του.
4. Περιορισμοί
Η παρεχόμενη άδεια βάσει της Ρήτρας 3 όπως προσδιορίζεται παραπάνω υπόκειται στους εξής περιορισμούς:
α.
Μπορείτε να προβείτε σε διανομή, ή δημόσια εκτέλεση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης μόνον βάσει των όρων της παρούσας Άδειας. Είστε υποχρεωμένοι να περιλάβετε ένα αντίγραφο αυτής της Άδειας ή το Κανονιστικό Αναγνωριστικό Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier) της Άδειας αυτής σε κάθε αντίγραφο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης το οποίο διανέμετε, ή εκτελείτε δημοσίως. Δεν μπορείτε να επιβάλλετε όρους στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης οι οποίοι περιορίζουν τους όρους της Άδειας ή την άσκηση από τον λήπτη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης των δικαιωμάτων που παρέχονται σ’ αυτόν υπό τους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Δεν μπορείτε να χορηγήσετε άδεια περαιτέρω εκμετάλλευσης του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης. Πρέπει να τηρείτε άθικτες όλες τις γνωστοποιήσεις που αφορούν την Άδεια αυτή και τους περιορισμούς της ευθύνης σε κάθε αντίγραφο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που διανέμετε ή παρουσιάζετε δημόσια. Σε κάθε διανομή ή δημόσια παρουσίαση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης, δεν επιτρέπετε να κάνετε χρήση οποιουδήποτε τεχνολογικού μέτρου επί του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που έχει ως αποτέλεσμα τον περιορισμό της άσκησης από τον λήπτη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης των δικαιωμάτων που παρέχονται σ’ αυτόν υπό τους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Η παρούσα Ρήτρα 4(α) ισχύει για το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης που είναι ενσωματωμένο σε Συλλογικό Έργο, αλλά δεν απαιτείται το Συλλογικό Έργο ξεχωριστά από το ίδιο το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης να υπόκειται στους όρους της παρούσας Άδειας. Αν δημιουργείτε Συλλογικό Έργο, εφόσον γίνει γνωστοποίηση από τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, πρέπει, στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατόν, να αφαιρέσετε από το Συλλογικό Έργο κάθε αναφορά σε δικαιούχο όπως αυτό απαιτείται από τη Ρήτρα 4(δ). Αν δημιουργείτε Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση), εφόσον γίνει γνωστοποίηση από τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια πρέπει, στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατόν, να αφαιρέσετε από το Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση) κάθε αναφορά σε δικαιούχο όπως αυτό απαιτείται από τη Ρήτρα 4(δ).
β.
Αν διανείμετε, ή παρουσιάζετε στο κοινό το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης ή το Παράγωγο Έργο (τροποποίηση) ή το Συλλογικό Έργο, πρέπει, εφόσον δεν έχει υποβληθεί αίτημα σχετικό με τη Ρήτρα 4(α), να κρατήσετε άθικτες όλες τις πληροφορίες για το δικαιούχο πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας και να παρέχετε, ανάλογα με το μέσον ή τα μέσα που χρησιμοποιείτε: (1) το όνομα (ή το ψευδώνυμο) του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή του Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων αν υπάρχει και/ή (2) αν ο Πρώτος Δημιουργός (Αρχικός Δικαιούχος) ή ο Δικαιούχος Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων και/ή ο Χορηγών την Άδεια ορίσει, στους όρους χρήσης ή σε άλλο σχετικό μέσο, άλλον ή άλλους (π.χ. ένα ινστιτούτο, εκδότη, περιοδικό) αναφορικά με τις πληροφορίες για τα δικαιώματα πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας όσον αφορά τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, το όνομα αυτού ή αυτών («Δικαιούχοι»). Επίσης, τον τίτλο του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης αν υπάρχει, και (3) στο βαθμό που αυτό είναι δυνατό, το Κανονιστικό Αναγνωριστικό Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier), αν υπάρχει, το οποίο ο Χορηγών την Άδεια προσδιορίζει συνδεόμενο με το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης, εκτός αν αυτό το Κανονιστικό Αναγνώρισης Πόρου (Uniform Resource Identifier) δεν αναφέρεται στις πληροφορίες για την πνευματική ιδιοκτησία ή στις πληροφορίες χορήγησης άδειας για το αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης. Επίσης, (4) υπόψη της Ρήτρας 3(β), στην περίπτωση του Παράγωγου Έργου (τροποποίησης), μία αναφορά που βεβαιώνει τη χρήση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης στο Παράγωγο Έργο (π.χ. «Γαλλική μετάφραση του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων» ή «Σενάριο βασισμένο στο αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων»). Αυτή η αναφορά που απαιτείται σύμφωνα με τη Ρήτρα 4(δ) μπορεί να γίνει με οποιονδήποτε εύλογο τρόπο, υπό τον όρο, όμως, ότι στην περίπτωση Παράγωγου Έργου (τροποποίησης) ή Συλλογικού Έργου, κατ’ ελάχιστη προϋπόθεση αυτή η αναφορά θα φαίνεται όπου εμφανίζεται οποιαδήποτε άλλη ανάλογη αναφορά δικαιούχου για συγγραφικό δικαίωμα και κατά τρόπο τουλάχιστον τόσο εμφανή όπως αυτή η άλλη ανάλογη αναφορά δικαιούχου για συγγραφικό δικαίωμα. Για την άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, μπορείτε να χρησιμοποιήσετε τις αναφορές που απαιτούνται από αυτή τη Ρήτρα για το σκοπό της πληροφόρησης περί το δικαιούχο πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας όπως ορίζεται παραπάνω, και επιπλέον κατά την άσκηση των δικαιωμάτων Σας υπό τους όρους αυτής της Άδειας, δεν μπορείτε έμμεσα ή άμεσα να επικαλεστείτε ή εννοήσετε την ύπαρξη οποιασδήποτε σχέσης ή έγκρισης από τον Πρώτο Δημιουργό (Αρχικό Δικαιούχο) ή τον Δικαιούχο Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων, τον Χορηγούντα την Άδεια, ή το Δικαιούχο που αφορά Εσάς ή τις χρήσεις του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης από Εσάς, χωρίς ταυτόχρονα να την αποδεικνύετε με ξεχωριστή, έγγραφη άδεια του Πρώτου Δημιουργού (Αρχικού Δικαιούχου) ή του Δικαιούχου Συγγενικών δικαιωμάτων, του Χορηγούντα την Άδεια ή του Δικαιούχου.
γ.
Προς άρση κάθε αμφιβολίας, οι περιορισμοί που αναφέρονται παραπάνω [4(α), 4(β)] δεν εφαρμόζονται σ’ αυτά τα μέρη του αντικείμενου της αδειοδότησης που περιλαμβάνονται στον ορισμό «Αντικείμενο της αδειοδότησης» αυτής της Άδειας αποκλειστικά επειδή συνιστούν αντικείμενο του δικαιώματος ειδικής φύσης (sui generis) του κατασκευαστή βάσης δεδομένων σύμφωνα με τον Ελληνικό νόμο περί πνευματικής ιδιοκτησίας κατ’ εφαρμογή της Οδηγίας 96/9/ΕΟΚ.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE A SOLICITOR-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT, RELATED RIGHTS, SUI GENERIS DATABASE RIGHT, AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
This Licence enables You (all capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and Distribute the Work worldwide provided that You credit the Original Author and comply with the other terms and conditions of this Licence.
'The Licensor' (one or more natural or legal persons offering the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence)
and
'You' (the natural or legal person acquiring rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.)
agree as follows:
1. Definitions
"Collective Work" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole, which by reason of the selection and arrangement of its contents constitutes an intellectual creation.
"Derivative Work" means any work created by the editing, modification, adaptation or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Derivative Work, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"Original Author" means the natural or legal person or persons that created the Work.
"Performance" means (i) a performance of any actors, singers, musicians, dancers or other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works or expressions of works of folklore, which is a live performance given by one or more individuals, and shall include a performance of a variety act or any similar presentation or (ii) a broadcast or rebroadcast of the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. A performance of a literary work includes a reading or recitation and a performance of a dramatic work includes a choreographic work or a work of mime. “Perform” shall be construed accordingly.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
"Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. For the purposes of this Licence a Work shall also be taken to mean a live Performance or a database insofar as these are protected under the applicable law within Your jurisdiction.
For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number.
2. Fair Dealing Rights Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses or rights permitted under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.
3. Licence Grant Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, the Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below for the duration of copyright, related right and/or sui generis database right in the Work.
to Reproduce the Work;
to create one or more Derivative Works; provided that any such Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works;
to Reproduce Derivative Works or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work;
to Distribute or Perform the Work, Derivative Works, or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work to the public in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter created.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(c) and Section 6.
Where the Licensor is the owner of the sui generis database rights under national law implementing Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases, the Licensor waives these rights.
4. Restrictions The Licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence. You must make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and Collective Works Distributed or Performed by You. You may not offer or impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work that restrict the terms of this Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to the recipient under the terms of the Licence. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. When You Distribute or Perform the Work, You must not impose any effective technological measures on the Work or the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Licence. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Perform the Work or any Derivative Work or Collective Work, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilising: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the work by original author," or "Screenplay based on original work by original author"). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this Licence, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and not waivable by applicable law.
For the avoidance of doubt: The restrictions mentioned above (4(a) and 4(b)) do not apply to those parts of the Work considered to fall within the definition of a "Work" under this Licence exclusively because they meet the criteria of the sui generis database right under national law implementing Directive 96/9/EC on the legal protection of databases.
Additional Provisions for recipients making use of the Work
5. Further licence from the Licensor
Each time You Distribute or Perform the Work, Collective Work, or a Derivative Work, the Licensor offers to the relevant recipient a licence to use the Work (or the original Work in case of a Derivative Work) on the same terms and conditions as the Licence granted to You hereunder.
6. Reservation and Waiver of Rights
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory Licence Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence;
Waivable Compulsory Licence Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence; and,
Voluntary Licence Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
7. Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as required by law, the Work is licensed by the Licensor on an "as is" and "as available" basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
8. Limit of Liability
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.
9. Termination
This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Natural or legal persons who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such natural or legal persons remain in full compliance with those Licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this Licence.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright, related right and/or sui generis database right in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
10. General
The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this Licence is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or unenforceable.
This Licence constitutes the entire licence between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication in any form.
No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
Creative Commons Notice
Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this Licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of this Licence.

Art. 1 - Definizioni
Ai fini e per gli effetti della presente licenza, si intende per
"Collezione di Opere", un'opera, come un numero di un periodico, un'antologia o un'enciclopedia, nella quale l'Opera nella sua interezza e forma originale, unitamente ad altri contributi costituenti loro stessi opere distinte ed autonome, sono raccolti in un'unità collettiva. Un'opera che costituisce Collezione di Opere non verrà considerata Opera Derivata (come sotto definita) ai fini della presente Licenza;
"Opera Derivata", un'opera basata sull'Opera ovvero sull'Opera insieme con altre opere preesistenti, come una traduzione, un arrangiamento musicale, un adattamento teatrale, narrativo, cinematografico, una registrazione di suoni, una riproduzione d'arte, un digesto, una sintesi, o ogni altra forma in cui l'Opera possa essere riproposta, trasformata o adattata. Nel caso in cui un'Opera tra quelle qui descritte costituisca già Collezione di Opere, essa non sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini della presente Licenza. Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, quando l'Opera sia una composizione musicale o registrazione di suoni, la sincronizzazione dell'Opera in relazione con un'immagine in movimento ("synching") sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini di questa Licenza;
"Licenziante", l'individuo, gli individui, l'ente o gli enti che offre o offrono l'Opera secondo i termini e le condizioni della presente Licenza;
"Autore Originario", il soggetto o i soggetti che ha o hanno creato l'Opera;
"Opera", l'opera dell'ingegno o, comunque, qualsiasi bene o prestazione suscettibile di protezione in forza delle leggi sul diritto d'autore (diritto d'autore, diritti connessi, diritto sui generis sulle banche dati, ecc.), la cui utilizzazione è offerta nel rispetto dei termini della presente Licenza;
"Tu"/"Te", l'individuo o l'ente che esercita i diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza e che non abbia precedentemente violato i termini della presente Licenza relativi all'Opera o che, nonostante una precedente violazione degli stessi, abbia ricevuto espressa autorizzazione dal Licenziante all'esercizio dei diritti derivanti dalla presente Licenza.
Art. 2 - Libere Utilizzazioni
La presente Licenza non intende in alcun modo ridurre, limitare o restringere alcuna utilizzazione non protetta dal diritto d'autore o alcun diritto di libera utilizzazione o l'operare della regola dell'esaurimento del diritto o altre limitazioni dei diritti sull'Opera derivanti dalle leggi applicabili.
Art. 3 - Concessione della Licenza
Nel rispetto dei termini e delle condizioni contenute nella presente Licenza, il Licenziante concede a Te una licenza per tutto il mondo, gratuita, non esclusiva e perpetua (per la durata del diritto d'autore applicabile) che autorizza ad esercitare i diritti sull'Opera qui di seguito elencati:
riproduzione dell'Opera, incorporazione dell'Opera in una o più Collezioni di Opere e riproduzione dell'Opera come incorporata nelle Collezioni di Opere;
creazione e riproduzione di un'Opera Derivata, a condizione che l'Opera Derivata (ivi incluse le traduzioni, con qualsiasi mezzo esse siano realizzate) contenga, nei modi appropriati alla forma dell'Opera Derivata, una chiara indicazione del fatto che sono state effettuate delle modifiche rispetto all'Opera originaria. Per esempio, una traduzione potrebbe contenere l'indicazione "questa è la traduzione in spagnolo dell'opera originaria, scritta in inglese"; una modifica potrebbe contenere l'indicazione "l'opera originaria è stata modificata";
distribuzione di copie dell'Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera è registrata, noleggio e prestito di copie dell'Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale dell'Opera, e ciò anche quando l'Opera sia incorporata in Collezioni di Opere;
distribuzione di copie dell'Opera Derivata o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera Derivata è registrata, noleggio e prestito di copie dell'Opera Derivata o di supporti fonografici su cui l'Opera Derivata è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale di Opere Derivate.
Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, se l'Opera sia di tipo musicale:
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione o esecuzione di opere incluse in repertori. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione o esecuzione, anche in forma digitale (ad es. tramite webcast) dell'Opera.
Compensi per versioni cover. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per ogni disco che Tu crei e distribuisci a partire dall'Opera (versione cover).
Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico dell'Opera mediante fonogrammi. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che se l'Opera è una registrazione di suoni, il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. IMAIE), per la comunicazione al pubblico dell'Opera, anche in forma digitale.
Altri compensi previsti dalla legge italiana. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere i compensi a lui attribuiti dalla legge italiana sul diritto d'autore (ad es. per l'inserimento dell'Opera in un'antologia ad uso scolastico ex art. 70 l. 633/1941). Al Licenziante spettano in ogni caso i compensi irrinunciabili a lui attribuiti dalla medesima legge (ad es. l'equo compenso spettante all'autore di opere musicali, cinematografiche, audiovisive o di sequenze di immagini in movimento nel caso di noleggio ai sensi dell'art. 18-bis l. 633/1941).
I diritti sopra descritti potranno essere esercitati con ogni mezzo di comunicazione e in tutti i formati. Tra i diritti di cui sopra si intende compreso il diritto di apportare all'Opera le modifiche che si rendessero tecnicamente necessarie per l'esercizio di detti diritti tramite altri mezzi di comunicazione o su altri formati. Tutti i diritti non espressamente concessi dal Licenziante rimangono riservati. Tutti i diritti morali irrinunciabili riconosciuti dalla legge applicabile rimangono riservati.
Qualora l'Opera concessa in licenza includa una o più banche dati sulle quali il Licenziante è titolare di un diritto sui generis ai sensi delle norme nazionali di attuazione della Direttiva 96/9/CE sulle banche dati, il Licenziante rinuncia a far valere il diritto corrispondente.
Art. 4 - Restrizioni
La Licenza concessa in conformità al precedente punto 3 è espressamente assoggettata a, e limitata da, le seguenti restrizioni:
Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l'Opera, anche in forma digitale, solo alle condizioni della presente Licenza e, insieme ad ogni copia dell'Opera (o supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l'Opera) che distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi proporre o imporre alcuna condizione relativa all'Opera che restringa i termini della presente Licenza o la capacità da parte di chi riceve l'Opera di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la presente Licenza. Non puoi concedere l'Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all'esclusione delle garanzie. Quando distribuisci, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in pubblico l'Opera, non puoi utilizzare alcuna misura tecnologica tale da limitare la capacità di chiunque riceva l'Opera da Te di esercitare gli stessi diritti concessi a Te con la presente licenza. Questo art. 4.a si applica all'Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di per sé ed indipendentemente dall'Opera stessa debba essere soggetta ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante, devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente possibile, ogni riferimento in accordo con quanto previsto dall'art. 4.b, come da richiesta. Qualora Tu crei un'Opera Derivata, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall'Opera Derivata stessa, nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento in accordo con quanto previsto dall'art. 4.b, come da richiesta.
Qualora Tu distribuisca, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegua, reciti o esponga in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, l'Opera (come definita dal succitato art. 1) o qualsiasi Opera Derivata (come definita dal succitato art. 1) o Collezione di Opere (come definita dal succitato art. 1), a meno che sia stata avanzata una richiesta ai sensi dell'art. 4.a, devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative sul diritto d'autore sull'Opera. Devi riconoscere una menzione adeguata rispetto al mezzo di comunicazione o supporto che utilizzi: (i) all'Autore Originario citando il suo nome (o lo pseudonimo, se del caso), ove fornito; e/o (ii) alle terze parti designate, se l'Autore Originario e/o il Licenziante hanno designato una o più terze parti (ad esempio, una istituzione finanziatrice, un ente editoriale, un giornale) ("Parti Designate") perché siano citate nell'informativa sul diritto d'autore del Licenziante o nei termini di servizio o con altri mezzi ragionevoli; (iii) il titolo dell'Opera, se indicato; (iv) nella misura in cui sia ragionevolmente possibile, l'Uniform Resource Identifier, che il Licenziante specifichi dover essere associato con l'Opera, salvo che tale URI non faccia alcun riferimento alla informativa sul diritto d'autore o non dia informazioni sulla licenza dell'Opera; (v) inoltre, in conformità a quanto previsto dall'art. 3.b, in caso di Opera Derivata, devi menzionare l'uso dell'Opera nell'Opera Derivata (ad esempio, "traduzione francese dell'Opera dell'Autore Originario", o "sceneggiatura basata sull'Opera originaria dell'Autore Originario"). La menzione richiesta dal presente art. 4.b può essere realizzata in qualsiasi maniera ragionevole possibile; in ogni caso, in ipotesi di Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, qualora compaia una menzione di tutti i coautori dell'Opera Derivata o della Collezione di Opere, allora essa deve essere parte di tale menzione e deve apparire con lo stesso risalto concesso alla menzione degli altri coautori. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che la menzione di cui al presente articolo ha lo scopo di riconoscere la paternità dell'Opera nei modi sopra indicati e che, esercitando i Tuoi diritti ai sensi della presente Licenza, Tu non puoi implicitamente o esplicitamente affermare o fare intendere un qualsiasi collegamento con l'Autore Originario, il Licenziante e/o le Parti Designate, o che l'Autore Originario, il Licenziante e/o le Parti Designate sponsorizzino o avallino Te o il Tuo utilizzo dell'Opera, a meno che non sussista un apposito, espresso e preventivo consenso scritto dell'Autore Originario, del Licenziante e/o delle Parti Designate.
Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che le restrizioni di cui ai precedenti punti 4.a e 4.b non si applicano a quelle parti dell'opera che siano da considerarsi Opera ai sensi della presente Licenza solo in quanto protette dal diritto sui generis su banca dati ai sensi delle norme nazionali di attuazione della Direttiva 96/9/CE sulle banche dati.
Art. 5 - Dichiarazioni, Garanzie ed Esonero da responsabilità
SALVO CHE SIA ESPRESSAMENTE CONVENUTO ALTRIMENTI PER ISCRITTO FRA LE PARTI, IL LICENZIANTE OFFRE L'OPERA IN LICENZA "COSÌ COM'È" E NON FORNISCE ALCUNA DICHIARAZIONE O GARANZIA DI QUALSIASI TIPO CON RIGUARDO ALL'OPERA, SIA ESSA ESPRESSA O IMPLICITA, DI FONTE LEGALE O DI ALTRO TIPO, ESSENDO QUINDI ESCLUSE, FRA LE ALTRE, LE GARANZIE RELATIVE AL TITOLO, ALLA COMMERCIABILITÀ, ALL'IDONEITÀ PER UN FINE SPECIFICO E ALLA NON VIOLAZIONE DI DIRITTI DI TERZI O ALLA MANCANZA DI DIFETTI LATENTI O DI ALTRO TIPO, ALL'ESATTEZZA O ALLA PRESENZA DI ERRORI, SIANO ESSI ACCERTABILI O MENO. ALCUNE GIURISDIZIONI NON CONSENTONO L'ESCLUSIONE DI GARANZIE IMPLICITE E QUINDI TALE ESCLUSIONE PUÒ NON APPLICARSI A TE.
Art. 6 - Limitazione di Responsabilità
SALVI I LIMITI STABILITI DALLA LEGGE APPLICABILE, IL LICENZIANTE NON SARÀ IN ALCUN CASO RESPONSABILE NEI TUOI CONFRONTI A QUALUNQUE TITOLO PER ALCUN TIPO DI DANNO, SIA ESSO SPECIALE, INCIDENTALE, CONSEQUENZIALE, PUNITIVO O ESEMPLARE, DERIVANTE DALLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DALL'USO DELL'OPERA, ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL LICENZIANTE SIA STATO EDOTTO SULLA POSSIBILITÀ DI TALI DANNI. NESSUNA CLAUSOLA DI QUESTA LICENZA ESCLUDE O LIMITA LA RESPONSABILITÀ NEL CASO IN CUI QUESTA DIPENDA DA DOLO O COLPA GRAVE.
Art. 7 - Risoluzione
La presente Licenza si intenderà risolta di diritto e i diritti con essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente, senza necessità di alcuna comunicazione in tal senso da parte del Licenziante, in caso di qualsivoglia inadempimento dei termini della presente Licenza da parte Tua, ed in particolare delle disposizioni di cui ai punti 4.a e/o 4.b, essendo la presente Licenza condizionata risolutivamente al verificarsi di tali inadempimenti. In ogni caso, la risoluzione della presente Licenza non pregiudicherà i diritti acquisiti da individui o enti che abbiano acquisito da Te Opere Derivate o Collezioni di Opere, ai sensi della presente Licenza, a condizione che tali individui o enti continuino a rispettare integralmente le licenze di cui sono parte. Le sezioni 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 rimangono valide in presenza di qualsiasi risoluzione della presente Licenza.
Sempre che vengano rispettati i termini e le condizioni di cui sopra, la presente Licenza è perpetua (e concessa per tutta la durata del diritto d'autore applicabile sull'Opera). Nonostante ciò, il Licenziante si riserva il diritto di rilasciare l'Opera sulla base dei termini di una differente licenza o di cessare la distribuzione dell'Opera in qualsiasi momento; fermo restando che, in ogni caso, tali decisioni non comporteranno recesso dalla presente Licenza (o da qualsiasi altra licenza che sia stata concessa, o che sia richiesto che venga concessa, ai termini della presente Licenza), e la presente Licenza continuerà ad avere piena efficacia, salvo che vi sia risoluzione come sopra indicato.
Art. 8 - Varie
Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti pubblicamente in forma digitale l'Opera o una Collezione di Opere, il Licenziante offre al destinatario una licenza per l'Opera nei medesimi termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi tramite la presente Licenza.
Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti pubblicamente in forma digitale un'Opera Derivata, il Licenziante offre al destinatario una licenza per l'Opera originaria nei medesimi termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi tramite la presente Licenza.
L'invalidità o l'inefficacia, secondo la legge applicabile, di una o più fra le disposizioni della presente Licenza, non comporterà l'invalidità o l'inefficacia dei restanti termini e, senza bisogno di ulteriori azioni delle parti, le disposizioni invalide o inefficaci saranno da intendersi rettificate nei limiti della misura che sia indispensabile per renderle valide ed efficaci.
In nessun caso i termini e le disposizioni di cui alla presente Licenza possono essere considerati rinunciati, né alcuna violazione può essere considerata consentita, salvo che tale rinuncia o consenso risultino per iscritto da una dichiarazione firmata dalla parte contro cui operi tale rinuncia o consenso.
La presente Licenza costituisce l'intero accordo tra le parti relativamente all'Opera qui data in licenza. Non esistono altre intese, accordi o dichiarazioni relative all'Opera che non siano quelle qui specificate. Il Licenziante non sarà vincolato ad alcuna altra disposizione addizionale che possa apparire in alcuna comunicazione da Te proveniente. La presente Licenza non può essere modificata senza il mutuo consenso scritto del Licenziante e Tuo.
La presente licenza è stata redatta sulla base della legge italiana, in particolare del Codice Civile del 1942 e della legge 22 Aprile 1941, n. 633 e successive modificazioni sulla protezione del diritto d'autore e di altri diritti connessi al suo esercizio.

Si Vous créez une Collection, Vous devez, à la demande de tout Donneur de Licence et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de la Collection toute mention de la source, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(b), et ce conformément à la demande. Si Vous créez une Adaptation, Vous devez, à la demande de tout Donneur de Licence et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de l’Adaptation toute mention de la source selon les modalités de l’Article 4(b).
Si vous Distribuez ou Représentez publiquement l’Œuvre, ou toutes Adaptations ou Collections, Vous devez, sauf introduction d’une demande conformément à l’Article 4(a), garder intact toutes les indications sur les droits d’auteur de l’Œuvre et stipuler, d’une manière appropriée en égard au support ou moyen que Vous utilisez : (i) le nom de l’Auteur Original (ou le pseudonyme, le cas échéant) s’il a été fourni et / ou, si l’Auteur Original et/ou le Donneur de Licence ont désigné une(des) autre(s) partie(s) comme étant investies de cette qualité (par ex. un sponsor, une maison d’édition, un journal) (« Parties Investies ») dans la mention relative aux droits d’auteur du Donneur de Licence, les conditions de service ou par tous autres moyens raisonnables, le nom de ladite partie ou desdites parties ; (ii) le titre de l’Œuvre, s’il a été fourni ; (iii) dans la mesure du possible, l’URI, le cas échéant, que le Donneur de Licence stipule comme étant lié à l’Œuvre, sauf si ledit URI ne fait pas référence à la mention de droit d’auteur ou d’octroi de la licence en rapport avec l’Œuvre, et (iv) de manière cohérente par rapport à l’Article 3(b), dans le cas d’une Adaptation, une indication de source identifiant l’utilisation de l’Œuvre dans l’Adaptation (par ex. « traduction française de l’Œuvre par l’Auteur Original » ou « scénario basé sur l’Œuvre originale de l’Auteur original »). L’indication de source requise par le présent article 4(b) pourra être faite par tout moyen raisonnable, sous réserve, toutefois, qu’en cas d’Adaptation ou de Collection, il conviendra de mentionner ladite indication de source d’une manière au moins aussi visible que les indications relatives aux autres auteurs y ayant contribué. A toutes fins utiles, Vous pouvez seulement utiliser l’indication de source requise par le présent Article exclusivement aux fins de l’attribution selon les modalités susmentionnées et, dans le cadre de l’exercice de Vos droits au titre de la présente Licence, Vous ne pouvez, implicitement ou explicitement, affirmer ou faire supposer une quelconque relation avec, un parrainage ou un aval de la part de l’Auteur Original, du Donneur de Licence et / ou des Parties Investies, selon le cas, de Votre personne ou de Votre utilisation de l’Œuvre, sans avoir l’autorisation distincte, expresse, écrite et préalable de l’Auteur Original, du Donneur de Licence et / ou des Parties Investies.
A toutes fins utiles : Les restrictions mentionnées par l’article 4(a) ne s’appliquent pas aux parties d’une Œuvre qui se définissent exclusivement comme Œuvre parce qu’elles sont régies par le droit de base de données sui generis suivant la transposition en droit national de la Directive Européenne sur les Bases de Données,
A toutes fins utiles : Les droits moraux, dans la mesure où ils sont reconnus par le droit national applicable, de la personne physique qui est l’Auteur Original de l’Œuvre ou des personnes physiques qui sont les Auteurs Originaux de l’Œuvre, ne sont pas affectés par la présente Licence.
5. Déclarations, garanties et exonérations de responsabilité
SAUF ACCORD COMMUN ECRIT DES PARTIES ET DANS LA MESURE PERMISE PAR LA LOI APPLICABLE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE PROPOSE L’ŒUVRE EN L'ETAT ET NE FORMULE AUCUNE GARANTIE NI DECLARATION DE QUELQUE NATURE QUE CE SOIT. CERTAINES JURIDICTIONS INTERDISENT L’EXCLUSION DE GARANTIES, AUQUEL CAS LA PRESENTE EXCLUSION NE VOUS EST PAS APPLICABLE.

SAUF DANS LA MESURE REQUISE PAR LA LOI APPLICABLE, LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE NE SAURAIT EN AUCUN CAS ETRE TENU RESPONSABLE A VOTRE EGARD AU TITRE DE QUELQUE DOCTRINE QUE CE SOIT DE TOUS DOMMAGES SPECIAUX, ACCESSOIRES, INDIRECTS, PUNITIFS OU EXEMPLAIRES DECOULANT DE LA PRESENTE LICENCE OU DE L’UTILISATION DE L’ŒUVRE, MEME DANS LE CAS OU LE DONNEUR DE LICENCE AURAIT ETE AVISE DE L'EVENTUALITE DESDITS DOMMAGES.

Les Articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 survivront à la résiliation de la présente Licence.
Sous réserve des conditions susmentionnées, la licence accordée par les présentes est conclue pour la durée du droit d’auteur applicable à l’Œuvre. Sans préjudice de ce qui précède, le Donneur de Licence se réserve, à tout moment, le droit d’exploiter l’Œuvre sous une autre licence ou de cesser la distribution de l’Œuvre sous réserve, toutefois, que ladite décision n'ait pas pour effet d’annuler la présente Licence (ou toute autre licence accordée ou devant être accordée en application de la présente Licence), étant entendu que la présente Licence restera en vigueur sauf s’il y est mis un terme dans les conditions susmentionnées.
8. Stipulations diverses
A chaque fois que Vous Distribuez ou Représentez publiquement l’Œuvre ou une Collection, le Donneur de Licence offre au bénéficiaire une licence sur l’Œuvre à des conditions identiques à celles qui Vous ont été concédées dans le cadre de la présente Licence.
Chaque fois que Vous Distribuez ou Représentez publiquement une Adaptation, le Donneur de Licence offre au bénéficiaire une licence sur l’Œuvre originale à des conditions identiques à celles qui Vous ont été concédées dans le cadre de la présente Licence.

Dans ce cas et sans qu’aucune intervention des parties ne soit requise, ladite disposition sera modifiée dans la mesure minimale nécessaire pour la rendre valable et applicable.
Aucune des conditions ou dispositions de la présente Licence ne sera réputée comme ayant fait l’objet d’une renonciation et aucune violation comme ayant été acceptée, sauf accord écrit et signé de la partie concernée.
La présente Licence représente l’intégralité de l’accord conclu entre les parties relativement à l’Œuvre objet de la présente Licence. Il n’existe aucun accord, contrat ni aucune déclaration relatifs à l’Œuvre qui ne seraient pas mentionnés aux présentes.

1. Definities
'Verzamelwerk' een werk waarin het Werk, in zijn geheel en in ongewijzigde vorm, samen met een of meer andere werken, die elk een afzonderlijk en zelfstandig werk vormen, tot een geheel is samengevoegd. Voorbeelden van een verzamelwerk zijn een tijdschrift, een bloemlezing of een encyclopedie. Een Verzamelwerk zal voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk (als hieronder omschreven) worden beschouwd.
'Afgeleid werk' een werk dat is gebaseerd op het Werk of op het Werk en andere reeds bestaande werken. Voorbeelden van een Afgeleid werk zijn een vertaling, een muziekschikking (arrangement), een toneelbewerking, een literaire bewerking, een verfilming, een geluidsopname, een kunstreproductie, een verkorte versie, een samenvatting of enig andere bewerking van het Werk, met dien verstande dat een Verzamelwerk voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk zal worden beschouwd. Indien het Werk een muziekwerk betreft, zal de synchronisatie van de tijdslijnen van het Werk en een bewegend beeld ('synching') voor de toepassing van deze Licentie als een Afgeleid Werk worden beschouwd.
'Licentiegever' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/rechtspersonen die het Werk volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie aanbiedt/aanbieden.
'Maker' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/personen die het oorspronkelijke werk gemaakt heeft/hebben. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder de Maker mede verstaan de uitvoerende kunstenaar, film- en fonogramproducent en omroeporganisaties in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de producent van een databank in de zin van de Databankenwet.
'Werk' het auteursrechtelijk beschermde werk dat volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie wordt aangeboden. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder het Werk mede verstaan het fonogram, de eerste vastlegging van een film en het (omroep)programma in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de databank in de zin van de Databankenwet, voor zover dit fonogram, deze eerste vastlegging van een film, dit (omroep)programma en deze databank beschermd wordt krachtens de toepasselijke wet in de jurisdictie van de Gebruiker.
'Gebruiker' de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon die rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uitoefent en die de voorwaarden van deze Licentie met betrekking tot het Werk niet eerder geschonden heeft, of die van de Licentiegever uitdrukkelijke toestemming gekregen heeft om rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uit te oefenen ondanks een eerdere schending.
2. Beperkingen van de uitsluitende rechten. Niets in deze Licentie strekt ertoe om de rechten te beperken die voortvloeien uit de beperkingen en uitputting van de uitsluitende rechten van de rechthebbende krachtens het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het databankenrecht of enige andere toepasselijke rechten.
3. Licentieverlening. Met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie verleent de Licentiegever hierbij aan de Gebruiker een wereldwijde, niet-exclusieve licentie om de navolgende rechten met betrekking tot het Werk vrij van royalty's uit te oefenen voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten:
het reproduceren van het Werk, het opnemen van het Werk in een of meerdere Verzamelwerken, en het reproduceren van het in de Verzamelwerken opgenomen Werk;
het maken en reproduceren van Afgeleide werken met dien verstande dat met betrekking tot het Afgeleide werk, met inbegrip van welke vertaling in welk medium dan ook, duidelijk wordt gemaakt dat er wijzigingen in het oorspronkelijke Werk zijn aangebracht. Bijvoorbeeld, aan een vertaling kan worden toegevoegd dat 'het oorspronkelijke Werk is van het Engels in het Spaans vertaald', of in geval van een verandering kan worden aangegeven dat 'het oorspronkelijke werk is veranderd';
het verspreiden van exemplaren van het Werk, het in het openbaar tonen, op- en uitvoeren en het on-line beschikbaar stellen van het Werk, afzonderlijk en als deel van een Verzamelwerk;
het verspreiden van exemplaren van Afgeleide werken, het in het openbaar te tonen, op- en uitvoeren en het on-line beschikbaar stellen van Afgeleide werken;
het opvragen en hergebruiken van het Werk;
Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat:
Niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen. in het geval van niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot thuiskopieën) de Licentiegever zich het recht voorbehoudt om dergelijke heffingen te innen (al dan niet door middel van een auteursrechtenorganisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk;
Voor afstand vatbare heffingsregeling. in het geval van voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot leenrechten) de Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om dergelijke heffingen te innen bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk;
Collectief rechtenbeheer. de Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om vergoedingen te innen (zelfstandig of, indien de Licentiegever lid is van een auteursrechtenorganisatie, door middel van die organisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk.
De Gebruiker mag deze rechten uitoefenen met behulp van alle thans bekende media, dragers en formats. De Gebruiker is tevens gerechtigd om technische wijzigingen aan te brengen die noodzakelijk zijn om de rechten met behulp van andere media, dragers en formats uit te oefenen. Alle niet uitdrukkelijk verleende rechten zijn hierbij voorbehouden aan de Licentiegever, met inbegrip van maar niet beperkt tot de rechten die in artikel 4(d) worden genoemd. Voor zover de Licentiegever op basis van het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn over uitsluitende rechten beschickt doet de Licentiegever afstand van deze rechten.
4. Beperkingen. De in artikel 3 verleende Licentie is uitdrukkelijk gebonden aan de volgende beperkingen:
De Gebruiker mag het Werk uitsluitend verspreiden, in het openbaar tonen, op- of uitvoeren of on-line beschikbaar stellen met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie, en de Gebruiker dient een exemplaar van, of de Uniform Resource Identifier voor, deze Licentie toe te voegen aan elk exemplaar van het Werk dat de Gebruiker verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert, of on-line beschikbaar stelt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk onder enige afwijkende voorwaarden aan te bieden waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk in sublicentie te geven. De Gebruiker dient alle vermeldingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie dan wel naar de uitsluiting van garantie te laten staan. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk te verspreiden, in het openbaar te tonen, op- of uit te voeren of on-line beschikbaar te stellen met toepassing van technologische voorzieningen waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het voorgaande is tevens van toepassing op het Werk dat deel uitmaakt van een Verzamelwerk, maar dat houdt niet in dat het Verzamelwerk, afgezien van het Werk zelf, gebonden is aan de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. Indien de Gebruiker een Verzamelwerk maakt, dient deze, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, de op grond van artikel 4(b) vereiste naamsvermelding uit het Verzamelwerk te verwijderen, voor zover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek. Indien de Gebruiker een Afgeleid werk maakt, dient hij, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, de op grond van artikel 4(b) vereiste naamsvermelding uit het Afgeleide werk te verwijderen, voorzover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek.
Indien de Gebruiker het Werk, Afgeleide Werken of Verzamelwerken verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert of on-line beschikbaar stelt, dient de Gebruiker, tenzij er sprake is van een verzoek als vermeld in lid 4(a), alle auteursrechtvermeldingen met betrekking tot het Werk te laten staan. Tevens dient de Gebruiker, op een wijze die redelijk is in verhouding tot het gebruikte medium, de naam te vermelden van (i) de Maker (of zijn/haar pseudoniem indien van toepassing) indien deze wordt vermeld; en/of (ii) van (een) andere partij(en) (b.v. sponsor, uitgeverij, tijdschrift) indien de naamsvermelding van deze partij(en) ("Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden") in de auteursrechtvermelding of algemene voorwaarden van de Licentiegever of op een andere redelijke wijze verplicht is gesteld door de Maker en/of de Licentiegever; de titel van het Werk indien deze wordt vermeld; voorzover redelijkerwijs toepasbaar de Uniform Resource Identifier, indien aanwezig, waarvan de Licentiegever heeft aangegeven dat deze bij het Werk hoort, tenzij de URI niet verwijst naar de auteursrechtvermeldingen of de licentie-informatie betreffende het Werk; in overeenstemming met artikel 3(b) in geval van een Afgeleid werk, door te verwijzen naar het gebruik van het Werk in het Afgeleide werk (bijvoorbeeld: 'De Franse vertaling van het Werk van de Maker' of 'Scenario gebaseerd op het Werk van de Maker'). De Gebruiker dient op redelijke wijze aan de in dit artikel genoemde vereisten te voldoen; echter, met dien verstande dat, in geval van een Afgeleid werk of een Verzamelwerk, de naamsvermeldingen in ieder geval geplaatst dienen te worden, indien er een naamsvermelding van alle makers van het Afgeleide werk of het Verzamelwerk geplaatst wordt dan als deel van die naamsvermeldingen, en op een wijze die in ieder geval even duidelijk is als de naamsvermeldingen van de overige makers. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat de Gebruiker uitsluitend gebruik mag maken van de naamsvermelding op de in dit artikel omschreven wijze teneinde te voldoen aan de naamsvermeldingsverplichting en, door gebruikmaking van zijn rechten krachtens deze Licentie, is het de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om op enigerlei wijze de indruk te wekken dat er sprake is van enig verband met, sponsorschap van of goedkeuring van de (toepasselijke) Maker, Licentiegever c.q. Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden van de Gebruiker of diens gebruik van het Werk, zonder de afzonderlijke, uitdrukkelijke, voorafgaande, schriftelijke toestemming van de Maker, Licentiegever c.q. Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden.
Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld, dat de hierboven vermelde beperkingen (lid 4(a) en lid 4(b)) niet van toepassing zijn op die onderdelen van het Werk die geacht worden te vallen onder de definitie van het 'Werk' zoals vermeld in deze Licentie uitsluitend omdat zij voldoen aan de criteria van het sui generis databankenrecht krachtens het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn.
De in artikel 3 verleende rechten moeten worden uitgeoefend met inachtneming van het morele recht van de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) om zich te verzetten tegen elke misvorming, verminking of andere aantasting van het werk, welke nadeel zou kunnen toebrengen aan de eer of de naam van de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) of aan zijn waarde in deze hoedanigheid, indien en voor zover de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) op grond van een op hem van toepassing zijnde wettelijke bepaling geen afstand kan doen van dat morele recht.
5. Garantie en vrijwaring.
TENZIJ ANDERS SCHRIFTELIJK IS OVEREENGEKOMEN DOOR DE PARTIJEN, STELT DE LICENTIEGEVER HET WERK BESCHIKBAAR OP 'AS-IS' BASIS, ZONDER ENIGE GARANTIE, HETZIJ DIRECT, INDIRECT OF ANDERSZINS, MET BETREKKING TOT HET WERK, MET INBEGRIP VAN, MAAR NIET BEPERKT TOT GARANTIES MET BETREKKING TOT DE EIGENDOMSTITEL, DE VERKOOPBAARHEID, DE GESCHIKTHEID VOOR BEPAALDE DOELEINDEN, MOGELIJKE INBREUK, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN LATENTE OF ANDERE TEKORTKOMINGEN, DE JUISTHEID OF DE AAN- OF AFWEZIGHEID VAN FOUTEN, ONGEACHT DE OPSPOORBAARHEID DAARVAN, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT.
6. Beperking van de aansprakelijkheid.
DE LICENTIEGEVER AANVAARDT GEEN ENKELE AANSPRAKELIJKHEID JEGENS DE GEBRUIKER VOOR ENIGE BIJZONDERE OF INCIDENTELE SCHADE OF GEVOLGSCHADE VOORTVLOEIEND UIT DEZE LICENTIE OF HET GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK, ZELFS NIET INDIEN DE LICENTIEGEVER OP DE HOOGTE IS GESTELD VAN HET RISICO VAN DERGELIJKE SCHADE, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT.
7. Beëindiging
Deze Licentie en de daarin verleende rechten vervallen automatisch op het moment dat de Gebruiker in strijd handelt met de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. De licenties van natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die Verzamelwerken hebben ontvangen van de Gebruiker krachtens deze Licentie blijven echter in stand zolang dergelijke natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen zich houden aan de voorwaarden van die licenties. Na de beëindiging van deze Licentie blijven artikelen 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 en 8 onverminderd van kracht.
Met inachtneming van de hierboven vermelde voorwaarden wordt de Licentie verleend voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten op het Werk. De Licentiegever behoudt zich desalniettemin te allen tijde het recht voor om het Werk volgens gewijzigde licentievoorwaarden te verspreiden of om het Werk niet langer te verspreiden; met dien verstande dat een dergelijk besluit niet de intrekking van deze Licentie (of enig andere licentie die volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie (verplicht) is verleend) tot gevolg heeft, en deze Licentie onverminderd van kracht blijft tenzij zij op de in lid a omschreven wijze wordt beëindigd.
8. Diversen
Elke keer dat de Gebruiker het Werk of een Verzamelwerk verspreidt of on-line beschikbaar stelt, biedt de Licentiegever de ontvanger een licentie op het Werk aan volgens de algemene voorwaarden van deze Licentie.
Elke keer dat de Gebruiker een Afgeleid werk verspreidt of on-line beschikbaar stelt, biedt de Licentiegever de ontvanger een licentie op het oorspronkelijke werk aan volgens de algemene voorwaarden van deze Licentie.
Indien enige bepaling van deze Licentie nietig of niet rechtens afdwingbaar is, zullen de overige voorwaarden van deze Licentie volledig van kracht blijven. De nietige of niet-afdwingbare bepaling zal, zonder tussenkomst van de partijen, worden vervangen door een geldige en afdwingbare bepaling waarbij het doel en de strekking van de oorspronkelijke bepaling zoveel mogelijk in acht worden genomen.
Een verklaring van afstand van in deze Licentie verleende rechten of een wijziging van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dient schriftelijk te geschieden en getekend te zijn door de partij die verantwoordelijk is voor de verklaring van afstand respectievelijk de partij wiens toestemming voor de wijziging is vereist.
Deze Licentie bevat de volledige overeenkomst tussen de partijen met betrekking tot het in licentie gegeven Werk. Er zijn geen andere afspraken gemaakt met betrekking tot het Werk. De Licentiegever is niet gebonden aan enige aanvullende bepalingen die worden vermeld in mededelingen van de Gebruiker. Deze licentie kan uitsluitend worden gewijzigd met de wederzijdse, schriftelijke instemming van de Licentiegever en de Gebruiker.
Aansprakelijkheid en merkrechten van Creative Commons
Creative Commons is geen partij bij deze Licentie en stelt geen enkele garantie met betrekking tot het Werk. Creative Commons kan op geen enkele wijze aansprakelijk worden gehouden jegens de Gebruiker of derden voor enigerlei schade met inbegrip van, maar niet beperkt tot enige algemene, bijzondere, incidentele of gevolgschade voortvloeiend uit deze Licentie. Onverminderd het bepaalde in de twee (2) voorgaande volzinnen is Creative Commons gebonden aan alle rechten en verplichtingen van de Licentiegever indien Creative Commons zichzelf uitdrukkelijk kenbaar gemaakt heeft als de Licentiegever krachtens deze Licentie.
Met uitzondering van het beperkte doel om iedereen erop te wijzen dat het Werk in licentie is gegeven krachtens de CCPL, geeft Creative Commons aan geen van de partijen toestemming om gebruik te maken van de merknaam 'Creative Commons', enige daarmee verband houdende merknamen dan wel het logo van Creative Commons gebruiken zonder de voorafgaande schriftelijke toestemming van Creative Commons. Het geoorloofde gebruik dient in overeenstemming te zijn met de alsdan geldende richtlijnen betreffende het gebruik van merknamen van Creative Commons zoals die bekend worden gemaakt op de website of anderszins van tijd tot tijd, desgevraagd, ter beschikking worden gesteld. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat deze merkrechtelijke beperking geen deel uitmaakt van de Licentie.

Licence
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
This Creative Commons New Zealand Public Licence enables You (all capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and distribute Works worldwide, provided that You credit the Original Author.
“The Licensor”
and
“You”
agree as follows:
1. Definitions
“Adaptation” means any work created by the editing, modification, adaptation or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronisation of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence.
“Attribution means acknowledging all the parties who have contributed to and have rights in the Work, Adaptation or Collection under this Licence; and “Attribute” has a corresponding meaning.
“Collection” means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole.
“Licence” means this Creative Commons New Zealand Public Licence agreement.
“Licensor” means one or more legally recognised persons or entities offering the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence.
“Original Author” means the individual(s) (or entity/ies) who created the Work.
“Work” means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence.
“You” means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number.
2. Licence Terms
2.1 Subject to the terms of this agreement the Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, Licence for use and for the duration of copyright in the Work.
You may:
copy the Work;
create one or more Adaptations. You must take reasonable steps to ensure any Adaptation clearly identifies that changes were made to the original Work;
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
copy Adaptations or the Work as incorporated in any Collection; and
publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise disseminate the Work, Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in any Collection, to the public.
All these rights may be exercised in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter created. All these rights also include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
HOWEVER,
You must not:
impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in a Collection that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
impose any digital rights management technology on the Work, the Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in a Collection that alters or restricts the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
sublicense the Work;
falsely Attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author;
subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in the Copyright Act 1994 provided that if the Licensor is the Original Author the Licensor will not enforce this sub-clause to the extent necessary to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under clause 2.1 to make Adaptations but not otherwise.
FINALLY,
You must:
make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and Adaptations and Collections published, distributed, performed or otherwise disseminated or made available to the public by You;
recognise the Licensor's / Original Author's right of Attribution (right to be identified) in any Work, Adaptation and Collection that You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate to the public and ensure that You credit the Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media used. You will however remove such a credit if requested by the Licensor/Original Author;
not assert or imply any connection with sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author or Licensor of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author or Licensor; and
to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
Additional Provisions
2.2. Further licence from the Licensor
Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate
the Work; or
any Adaptation; or
the Work as incorporated in a Collection
the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use of the Work (“User”) (in any of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Work on the same terms and conditions as granted to You hereunder.
2.3. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.
2.4. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved.
2.5. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or via a licensing body such as a collecting society, for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this Licence.
2.6. If the Licensor is the Original Author the Licensor waives its moral right to object to derogatory treatments of the Work to the extent necessary to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under this Licence to make Adaptations but not otherwise. If the Licensor is not the Original Author the Work will still be subject to the moral rights of the Original Author.
3. Warranties and Disclaimer
Except as required by law or as otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, the Work or any Adaptation is licensed by the Licensor on an “as is” and “as available” basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
4. Limit of Liability
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be liable on any legal basis (including without limitation negligence) and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You.
5. Termination
The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those Licences. Clauses 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any termination of this Licence.
6. General

6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights under the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 to enforce any of its terms.
7. On the role of Creative Commons
7.1. Creative Commons does not authorise either the Licensor or the User to use the trade mark “Creative Commons” or any related trade mark, including the Creative Commons logo, except to indicate that the Work is licensed under a Creative Commons Licence. Any permitted use has to be in compliance with the Creative Commons trade mark usage guidelines at the time of use of the Creative Commons trade mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons website or be otherwise available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt this trade mark restriction does not form part of this Licence.
7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor or user of the Licence.
7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires of the Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role and agreement by all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not responsible to anyone for the statements and actions of You or the Licensor or anyone else attempting to use or using this Licence.
7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the Licence, and in all events is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from the Licensor's or Your reliance on this Licence or on its enforceability.
7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS THESE CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION'S VERY LIMITED ROLE AS A FACILITATOR OF THE LICENCE FROM THE LICENSOR TO YOU.

UTWÓR (ZDEFINIOWANY PONIŻEJ) PODLEGA NINIEJSZEJ LICENCJI PUBLICZNEJ CREATIVE COMMONS ("CCPL" LUB "LICENCJA"). UTWÓR PODLEGA OCHRONIE PRAWA AUTORSKIEGO LUB INNYCH STOSOWNYCH PRZEPISÓW PRAWA. KORZYSTANIE Z UTWORU W SPOSÓB INNY NIŻ DOZWOLONY NA PODSTAWIE NINIEJSZEJ LICENCJI LUB PRZEPISÓW PRAWA JEST ZABRONIONE.
WYKONANIE JAKIEGOKOLWIEK UPRAWNIENIA DO UTWORU OKREŚLONEGO W NINIEJSZEJ LICENCJI OZNACZA PRZYJĘCIE I ZGODĘ NA ZWIĄZANIE POSTANOWIENIAMI NINIEJSZEJ LICENCJI.
1. Definicje
"Utwór zależny" oznacza opracowanie Utworu lub Utworu i innych istniejących wcześniej utworów lub przedmiotów praw pokrewnych, z wyłączeniem materiałów stanowiących Zbiór. Dla uniknięcia wątpliwości, jeżeli Utwór jest utworem muzycznym, artystycznym wykonaniem lub fonogramem, synchronizacja Utworu w czasie z obrazem ruchomym ("synchronizacja") stanowi Utwór Zależny w rozumieniu niniejszej Licencji.
"Zbiór" oznacza zbiór, antologię, wybór lub bazę danych spełniającą cechy utworu, nawet jeżeli zawierają nie chronione materiały, o ile przyjęty w nich dobór, układ lub zestawienie ma twórczy charakter.

"Rozpowszechnianie" oznacza wprowadzanie do obrotu, użyczenie lub najem oryginału albo egzemplarzy Utworu lub Utworu Zależnego.

"Twórca" oznacza (z zastrzeżeniem Par. 8(g)), w odniesieniu do utworów twórcę lub podmiot, na rzecz którego prawa autorskie przysługują w sposób pierwotny, lub w przypadku niemożności ustalenia tych podmiotów, wydawcę lub producenta, a dodatkowo:
w przypadku artystycznych wykonań - aktorów, recytatorów, dyrygentów, instrumentalistów, wokalistów, tancerzy i mimów oraz inne osoby w sposób twórczy przyczyniające się do powstania wykonania;
w przypadku fonogramu lub wideogramu - producenta fonogramu lub wideogramu;
w przypadku nadań programów - organizację radiową lub telewizyjną;
w przypadku pierwszych wydań - wydawcę, który jako pierwszy w sposób zgodny z prawem opublikował lub w inny sposób rozpowszechnił utwór, którego czas ochrony już wygasł, a jego egzemplarze nie były jeszcze publicznie udostępniane;
w przypadku wydań naukowych i krytycznych - tego, kto po upływie czasu ochrony prawa autorskiego do utworu przygotował jego wydanie krytyczne lub naukowe, nie będące utworem;
w przypadku baz danych niespełniających cech utworu - producenta bazy danych.
"Utwór" oznacza przedmiot praw autorskich lub praw pokrewnych lub bazę danych niespełniającą cech utworu udostępniane na podstawie niniejszej Licencji, z zastrzeżeniem Par. 8(g).
"Licencjobiorca" oznacza osobę fizyczną lub jednostkę organizacyjną korzystającą z uprawnień określonych niniejszą Licencją, która nie naruszyła uprzednio warunków niniejszej Licencji w odniesieniu do Utworu, lub która mimo uprzedniego naruszenia uzyskała wyraźną zgodę Licencjodawcy na wykonywanie uprawnień przyznanych Licencją.
"Publiczne Wykonanie" oznacza publiczne wykonanie, wystawienie, wyświetlenie, odtworzenie oraz nadawanie i reemitowanie, a także publiczne udostępnianie Utworu w taki sposób, aby każdy mógł mieć do niego dostęp w miejscu i w czasie przez siebie wybranym.

2. Dozwolony użytek. Żadne postanowienie niniejszej Licencji nie zmierza do ograniczenia, wyłączenia lub zawężenia sposobów korzystania nieobjętych prawem autorskim lub uprawnień wynikających z ograniczeń lub wyjątków od ochrony prawa autorskiego wynikających z przepisów prawa autorskiego lub innych znajdujących zastosowanie przepisów.
3. Udzielenie licencji. Zgodnie z postanowieniami niniejszej Licencji, Licencjodawca udziela niniejszym Licencjobiorcy nieodpłatnej i niewyłącznej licencji na korzystanie z Utworu na terytorium całego świata, na czas nieoznaczony (do momentu wygaśnięcia praw autorskich), na następujących polach eksploatacji:
Zwielokrotnianie Utworu, włączanie Utworu do jednego lub więcej Zbiorów, Zwielokrotnianie Utworu włączonego do Zbiorów;
Sporządzanie i Zwielokrotnianie Utworów Zależnych pod warunkiem, że wszelkie takie Utwory Zależne, w tym wszelkie tłumaczenia na jakimkolwiek nośniku zostały w rozsądnym zakresie wyraźnie oznaczone, wyróżnione lub w inny sposób zostało na nich wskazane, że w oryginalnym Utworze dokonano zmian. Na przykład na tłumaczeniu można umieścić adnotację: „Oryginał utworu został przetłumaczony z angielskiego na hiszpański”, lub można wskazać, że tłumaczenie „Zawiera zmiany w stosunku do oryginału”;
Rozpowszechnianie oraz Publiczne Wykonanie Utworu w tym Utworu włączonego do Zbiorów;
Rozpowszechnianie oraz Publiczne Wykonanie Utworów Zależnych; oraz
Pobieranie danych z Utworu oraz ich wtórne wykorzystanie.
Dla uniknięcia wątpliwości:
Niezbywalne prawo wynagrodzenia i przymusowe pośrednictwo. Jeżeli według prawa właściwego:
Licencjodawcy przysługuje niezbywalne prawo do wynagrodzenia, lub
korzystanie z Utworu w określony sposób jest możliwe jedynie za pośrednictwem osoby trzeciej, a Licencjodawca nie może skutecznie wyłączyć takiego przymusowego pośrednictwa niniejszą Licencją,
to Licencjodawca zastrzega sobie wyłączne prawo do takiego wynagrodzenia oraz zastrzega takie przymusowe pośrednictwo bez ograniczeń;
Zbywalne prawo wynagrodzenia z tytułu licencji ustawowych oraz przymusowe pośrednictwo. Jeżeli według prawa właściwego:
Licencjodawca nie może się sprzeciwić wykorzystaniu Utworu na określone sposoby, a przysługuje mu za to zbywalne prawo do wynagrodzenia,
korzystanie z Utworu w określony sposób jest możliwe jedynie za pośrednictwem osoby trzeciej, lecz Licencjodawca może wyłączyć takie przymusowe pośrednictwo, lub
domniemywa się, że osoba trzecia może występować na rzecz Licencjodawcy,
to Licencjodawca zrzeka się takiego wynagrodzenia, przymusowego pośrednictwa oraz wyłącza takie domniemanie (odpowiednio); oraz
Wynagrodzenia umowne oraz członkostwo w organizacji zbiorowego zarządzania, Licencjodawca zrzeka się wynagrodzenia pobieranego osobiście, bądź za pośrednictwem organizacji zbiorowego zarządzania.
Powyższe uprawnienia Licencjobiorca może wykonywać na wszystkich rodzajach nośników, we wszystkich rodzajach środków przekazu, oraz we wszystkich aktualnie znanych formatach. Powyższe uprawnienia obejmują także uprawnienie do dokonywania modyfikacji Utworu koniecznych z technicznego punktu widzenia w celu wykonania uprawnień w różnych środkach przekazu, nośnikach lub formatach. Wszystkie prawa wyraźnie nie udzielone przez Licencjodawcę uważa się za zastrzeżone, włączając w to w szczególności uprawnienia określone w niniejszym Paragrafie 3(f) oraz Paragrafie 4(d).
W zakresie, w jakim prawo właściwe wdrażające Dyrektywę Parlamentu Europejskiego i Rady Nr 96/9 z 11.3.1996 r. o prawnej ochronie baz danych przyznaje Licencjodawcy prawa wyłączne do Utworu (lub do jego części) stanowiącego bazę danych niespełniającą cech utworu, Licencjodawca zrzeka się tego prawa. W przypadku, gdy takie zrzeczenie się jest nieskuteczne w świetle prawa właściwego, Licencjodawca zobowiązuje się do niewykonywania tego prawa.
4. Ograniczenia. Uprawnienia przyznane w Paragrafie 3 podlegają następującym ograniczeniom:
Licencjobiorca może Rozpowszechniać lub Publicznie Wykonywać Utwór jedynie zgodnie z postanowieniami niniejszej Licencji oraz pod warunkiem dołączenia kopii niniejszej Licencji lub wskazania wskazania jednolitego identyfikatora zasobu (URI), pod którym znajduje się tekst niniejszej Licencji do każdego egzemplarza Utworu Rozpowszechnianego lub Publicznie Wykonywanego.
Licencjobiorca nie może oferować ani narzucać żadnych warunków w związku z Utworem, które ograniczają postanowienia niniejszej Licencji lub możliwość korzystającego z Utworu wykonywania uprawnień udzielonych temu korzystającemu zgodnie z postanowieniami niniejszej Licencji.
Licencjobiorca nie może udzielać sublicencji.
Licencjobiorca nie może zmieniać lub usuwać oznaczeń Utworu odnoszących się do niniejszej Licencji oraz zawartej w niej klauzuli uchylenia się od odpowiedzialności na żadnym egzemplarzu Utworu Rozpowszechnianym lub Publicznie Wykonywanym.
Rozpowszechniając lub Publicznie Wykonując Utwór, Licencjobiorca nie ma prawa stosować żadnych skutecznych zabezpieczeń technicznych w stosunku do Utworu, ograniczających możliwość wykonywania praw wynikających z Licencji przez korzystającego z Utworu, który uzyskał Utwór od Licencjobiorcy.
Niniejszy Paragraf 4(a) stosuje się również do Utworu włączonego do Zbioru, jednak Licencjobiorca nie jest zobowiązany objąć Zbioru postanowieniami niniejszej Licencji.
W przypadku stworzenia przez Licencjobiorcę Zbioru, na wezwanie któregokolwiek z Licencjodawców Licencjobiorca jest zobowiązany w rozsądnym zakresie usunąć ze Zbioru wszelkie oznaczenia wymagane na podstawie Paragrafu 4(b), wedle wezwania.
Rozpowszechniając lub Publicznie Wykonując Utwór lub jakikolwiek Utwór Zależny lub Zbiór, Licencjobiorca jest zobowiązany, o ile nie otrzymał wezwania zgodnie z Paragrafem 4(a), zachować w stanie nienaruszonym wszelkie oznaczenia związane z prawno-autorską ochroną Utworu oraz zapewnić, stosownie do możliwości używanego nośnika lub środka przekazu oznaczenie:
imienia i nazwiska (lub pseudonimu, odpowiednio) Twórcy, jeżeli zostały one dołączone do Utworu, oraz (lub) nazwę innych podmiotów jeżeli Twórca oraz (lub) Licencjodawca wskażą w oznaczeniach związanych z prawno-autorską ochroną Utworu, regulaminach lub w inny rozsądny sposób takie inne podmioty (np. sponsora, wydawcę, czasopismo) celem ich wymienienia ("Osoby Wskazane");
tytułu Utworu, jeżeli został dołączony do Utworu;
w rozsądnym zakresie URI, o ile istnieje, który Licencjodawca wskazał jako związany z Utworem, chyba że taki URI nie odnosi się do oznaczenia związanego z prawno-autorską ochroną Utworu lub do informacji o zasadach licencjonowania Utworu; oraz
z zachowaniem postanowień Paragrafu 3(b), w przypadku Utworu Zależnego, oznaczenie wskazujące na wykorzystanie Utworu w Utworze Zależnym (np. "francuskie tłumaczenie Utworu Twórcy," lub "scenariusz na podstawie Utworu Twórcy").
Oznaczenia wymagane na podstawie niniejszego Paragrafu 4(b) mogą być wprowadzone w jakikolwiek rozsądny sposób, przy czym w przypadku Utworu Zależnego lub Zbioru przynajmniej w tych wszystkich miejscach, gdzie uwidocznione są oznaczenia odnoszące się do twórców pozostałych części lub wkładów w sposób przynajmniej tak samo widoczny jak te inne oznaczenia, o ile dokonano uwidocznienia oznaczeń wszystkich twórców pozostałych części lub wkładów.
Dla uniknięcia wątpliwości, Licencjobiorca może wykorzystywać oznaczenia wymagane w niniejszym Paragrafie wyłącznie dla celów wskazania właściwych podmiotów w sposób określony powyżej, a wykonując uprawnienia z niniejszej Licencji, Licencjobiorca nie może w sposób dorozumiany ani wyraźny stwierdzać lub sugerować istnienia powiązania, poparcia lub aprobaty ze strony Twórcy, Licencjodawcy oraz (lub) Osób Wskazanych dla Licencjobiorcy lub sposobu korzystania z Utworu przez Licencjobiorcę, o ile co innego nie wynika z odrębnego zezwolenia Twórcy, Licencjodawcy oraz (lub) Osób Wskazanych wyrażonego na piśmie pod rygorem nieważności.
Dla uniknięcia wątpliwości, ograniczenia, o których mowa w Paragrafach 4(a) i 4(b), nie mają zastosowania do takich Utworów lub ich części, które spełniają definicję Utworu w rozumieniu niniejszej Licencji wyłącznie dlatego, że stanowią bazę danych niespełniającą cech utworu.
Niniejsza licencja nie narusza praw osobistych Twórcy ani Licencjodawcy w zakresie, w jakim prawa te są chronione przez prawo właściwe, a niniejsza Licencja lub odrębne porozumienie zawarte na piśmie pod rygorem nieważności nie stanowi skutecznie inaczej.
5. Oświadczenia, Zapewnienia oraz Wyłączenie odpowiedzialności
JEŻELI STRONY NIE POSTANOWIĄ INACZEJ W ODRĘBNYM POROZUMIENIU SPORZĄDZONYM NA PIŚMIE POD RYGOREM NIEWAŻNOŚCI, LICENCJODAWCA UDOSTĘPNIA UTWÓR W TAKIEJ FORMIE W JAKIEJ ZAPOZNAŁ SIĘ Z NIM LICENCJOBIORCA I W NAJDALEJ IDĄCYM STOPNIU NA JAKI POZWALA PRAWO WŁAŚCIWE NIE SKŁADA ŻADNYCH ZAPEWNIEŃ ORAZ NIE UDZIELA ŻADNYCH GWARANCJI A TAKŻE WYŁĄCZA RĘKOJMIĘ, CZY TO WYRAŹNĄ, DOROZUMIANĄ CZY INNĄ, W SZCZEGÓLNOŚCI DOTYCZĄCYCH TYTUŁU, MOŻLIWOŚCI KORZYSTANIA Z UTWORU ZGODNIE Z JEGO PRZEZNACZENIEM, PRZEZNACZENIA UTWORU DO KONKRETNEGO CELU, CO DO TEGO, ŻE NIE NARUSZA ON PRAW INNYCH OSÓB, BRAKU JAWNYCH LUB UKRYTYCH WAD, DOKŁADNOŚCI, WYSTĘPOWANIA LUB NIEWYSTĘPOWANIA WAD WIDOCZNYCH JAK I UKRYTYCH. PRAWO WŁAŚCIWE MOŻE NIE ZEZWALAĆ NA NIEKTÓRE SPOŚRÓD POWYŻSZYCH WYŁĄCZEŃ, WIĘC MOGĄ ONE NIE MIEĆ ZASTOSOWANIA.
6. Ograniczenie odpowiedzialności
O ILE PRAWO WŁAŚCIWE NIE STANOWI INACZEJ, W ŻADNYM WYPADKU LICENCJODAWCA NIE ODPOWIADA WOBEC LICENCJOBIORCY NA ŻADNEJ PODSTAWIE PRAWNEJ ZA ŻADNE SZCZEGÓLNE, PRZYPADKOWE LUB NASTĘPCZE SZKODY WYNIKAJĄCE Z NINIEJSZEJ LICENCJI LUB WYKORZYSTANIA UTWORU, NAWET JEŻELI LICENCJODAWCA ZOSTAŁ POWIADOMIONY O MOŻLIWOŚCI WYSTĄPIENIA TAKICH SZKÓD.
7. Wygaśnięcie
Licencja automatycznie wygasa w przypadku jakiegokolwiek jej naruszenia przez Licencjobiorcę. W takim przypadku licencje osób, które otrzymały od Licencjobiorcy Utwór Zależny lub Zbiór, nie wygasają, o ile osoby te nie naruszają postanowień tych licencji. Paragrafy 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 oraz 8 pozostają w mocy po wygaśnięciu niniejszej Licencji.
Zgodnie z powyższymi postanowieniami Licencja udzielana jest na czas nieoznaczony (do momentu wygaśnięcia praw autorskich). Niezależnie od tego Licencjodawca zachowuje prawo do udostępnienia Utworu na innych warunkach, lub do zaprzestania udostępniania Utworu, z tym jednak zastrzeżeniem, że taka decyzja Licencjodawcy nie będzie stanowiła wypowiedzenia lub innego rozwiązania niniejszej Licencji (lub też innej licencji udzielonej na podstawie niniejszej Licencji), która raz udzielona Licencjobiorcy w pełnym wymiarze obowiązuje dopóki nie nastąpi jej wygaśnięcie zgodnie z postanowieniem poprzedzającym.
8. Postanowienia różne
Za każdym razem, gdy Licencjobiorca Rozpowszechnia lub Publicznie Wykonuje Utwór lub Zbiór, Licencjodawca oferuje korzystającym licencję na Utwór na takich samych warunkach jakie uzyskał Licencjobiorca na podstawie niniejszej Licencji.
Za każdym razem, gdy Licencjobiorca Rozpowszechnia lub Publicznie Wykonuje Utwór Zależny, Licencjodawca oferuje korzystającym licencję na Utwór oryginalny na takich samych warunkach, jakie uzyskał Licencjobiorca na podstawie niniejszej Licencji.
Jeśli jakiekolwiek postanowienie niniejszej Licencji jest nieważne lub bezskuteczne w świetle obowiązującego prawa, jego nieważność lub bezskuteczność nie wpływa na pozostałe postanowienia Licencji. W przypadku braku dodatkowego porozumienia między stronami, nieważne lub bezskuteczne postanowienie powinno być interpretowane tak, aby zachować jego ważność i skuteczność oraz brzmienie możliwe bliskie brzmieniu pierwotnemu.
Żadnego z postanowień niniejszej Licencji nie uznaje się za uchylone, a żadnego naruszenia nie uznaje się za zaakceptowane, dopóki druga strona, pod rygorem nieważności, nie uzna pisemnie takiego uchylenia lub też nie wyrazi na piśmie następczego zezwolenia na naruszenie.
Niniejsza Licencja zawiera całość postanowień pomiędzy stronami dotyczących udostępnianego na jej podstawie Utworu. Wszystkie nie ujęte w tej Licencji postanowienia, porozumienia lub oświadczenia dotyczące Utworu uznaje się za nieistniejące. Licencjodawcy nie wiążą żadne dodatkowe postanowienia podane mu do wiadomości przez Licencjobiorcę w jakikolwiek sposób. Wszelkie zmiany Licencji wymagają umowy pomiędzy Licencjodawcą a Licencjobiorcą wyrażonej na piśmie pod rygorem nieważności.
Ten punkt został pominięty.
Wyrażenia użyte w niniejszej Licencji należy rozumieć zgodnie z Ustawą z 4 lutego 1994 r. o prawie autorskim i prawach pokrewnych (Dz. U. z 2000 r. Nr 80, poz. 904 t. jedn. z późn. zm.) oraz zgodnie z Ustawą z 27 lipca 2001 o ochronie baz danych (Dz. U. z 2001 r. Nr 128 poz. 1402 z późn. zm.), o ile prawem właściwym jest prawo polskie. W żadnym przypadku zakres niniejszej Licencji nie może być szerszy niż zakres odpowiedniego prawa wyłącznego określony zgodnie z przepisami prawa właściwego.

Representação institucional obrigatória irrenunciável. Quando o direito de cobrar uma compensação monetária ou remuneração equitativa esteja sujeito a representação institucional obrigatória e seja, ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, irrenunciável, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito exclusivo de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração por qualquer exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença; e
Representação institucional obrigatória renunciável. Quando o direito de cobrar uma compensação monetária ou remuneração equitativa esteja sujeito a representação institucional obrigatória e seja, ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, renunciável, o Licenciante renuncia ao direito exclusivo de cobrar tal compensação/remuneração por qualquer exercício pelo Utilizador dos direitos concedidos sob esta Licença; e

Os direitos acima referidos podem ser exercidos em todos os meios e formatos, tangíveis ou intangíveis, independente de serem conhecidos agora ou concebidos posteriormente.

Caso o Licenciante seja titular dos direitos exclusivos previstos no Capítulo III do Decreto-Lei n.º 122/2000 de 4 de Julho, que implementou para a ordem jurídica portuguesa a Diretiva n.º 96/9/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 11 de Março, relativa à proteção jurídica de bases de dados, declara expressamente renunciar a esses direitos.
4. Restrições. A licença concedida na Secção 3 supra está expressamente sujeita e limitada pelas seguintes restrições:
O Utilizador apenas pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho sob os termos desta Licença. O Utilizador deve incluir, em cada cópia do Trabalho que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, uma cópia desta Licença ou o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI). O Utilizador não pode propor ou impor quaisquer termos que alterem ou restrinjam os termos desta Licença ou o exercício, por parte do destinatário, dos direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. O Utilizador não pode sub-licenciar o Trabalho. O Utilizador deve manter intactas, em cada cópia do Trabalho que Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público, todos os avisos que se referem a esta Licença e à exclusão de garantias. O Utilizador não pode Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público nenhuma cópia do Trabalho com qualquer medida tecnológica que restrinja a possibilidade do destinatário exercer os direitos a ele concedidos sob os termos desta Licença. Esta Secção 4(a) aplica-se ao Trabalho quando incorporado em Coleções, mas isto não requer que a Coleção, independente do próprio Trabalho, esteja sujeita aos termos desta Licença. Se o Utilizador criar uma Coleção ou um Trabalho Derivado e for notificado pelo Licenciante para remover da Coleção ou do Trabalho Derivado qualquer crédito inserido em conformidade com o estipulado na Secção 4(b), deve, na medida do razoável, agir de acordo com o solicitado.
Se o Utilizador Distribuir ou Apresentar ao Público o Trabalho ou qualquer Trabalho Derivado ou Coleção, deve – a menos que o Licenciante o tenha notificado em sentido contrário nos termos da Secção 4(a) parte final – manter intactos todos os avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, e exibir, de forma razoável em relação ao meio ou meios por si empregues: (i) o nome ou o pseudónimo, se fornecidos, do Titular Originário, nos avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, nos termos de serviço ou através de outros meios razoáveis; e/ou (ii) o nome da parte ou partes (por exemplo, um instituto, uma editora, uma revista) que o Titular Originário e/ou o Licenciante tiverem designado para atribuição (“Partes de Atribuição”), nos avisos referentes ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho, nos termos de serviço ou através de outros meios razoáveis; e (iii) o título do Trabalho, se fornecido; e (iv) o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante tenha especificado para estar associado ao Trabalho, se o houver, exceto se o URI não disser respeito ao aviso referente ao direito de autor ou direito conexo sobre o Trabalho ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento do Trabalho; e (v) no caso de Trabalho Derivado, em conformidade com a Secção 3(b), um crédito identificando a transformação do Trabalho num Trabalho Derivado (por exemplo: "Tradução Portuguesa da Obra original do Autor” ou "Guião baseado na Obra original do Autor"). Os créditos exigidos por esta Secção 4(b) podem ser implementados de qualquer forma, desde que razoável. No caso de um Trabalho Derivado ou Coleção, exibindo-se os créditos de todos os autores participantes do Trabalho Derivado ou Coleção, os créditos ora exigidos devem fazer parte daqueles e devem aparecer de modo pelo menos tão proeminente quanto os créditos dados aos demais autores participantes. De modo a evitar dúvidas, o Utilizador apenas poderá fazer uso dos créditos exigidos por esta Secção 4(b) para o propósito de atribuição na forma estabelecida acima. Ao exercer os seus direitos sob esta Licença, o Utilizador não poderá implícita ou explicitamente afirmar ou sugerir qualquer vínculo, patrocínio ou apoio do Titular Originário, Licenciante e/ou Partes de Atribuição a si ou ao seu uso do Trabalho, a menos que tenha obtido prévia e expressamente autorização daqueles.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se que as restrições acima mencionadas [4(a) e 4(b)] não se aplicam àquelas partes do Trabalho que apenas sejam protegidas pelo direito especial do fabricante de base de dados previsto no art. 12.º do Decreto-Lei n.º 122/2000 de 4 de Julho, que implementou para a ordem jurídica portuguesa a Diretiva n.º 96/9/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 11 de Março, relativa à proteção jurídica de bases de dados.
Nada nesta Licença poderá afetar quaisquer dos direitos morais assegurados ao Autor ou ao Artista pela Legislação Aplicável, incluindo, sem limitação, o direito de oposição a toda e qualquer mutilação, deformação ou outra modificação do Trabalho e, de um modo geral, a todo e qualquer ato que a desvirtue e possa afetar a honra e reputação do Autor ou do Artista.
5. Declarações, Garantias e Exoneração
EXCETO QUANDO EXPRESSAMENTE ACORDADO PELAS PARTES POR ESCRITO EM SENTIDO CONTRÁRIO E NA MEDIDA PERMITIDA PELA LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL, O LICENCIANTE DISPONIBILIZA O TRABALHO “NO ESTADO EM QUE SE ENCONTRA” (“AS-IS BASIS”), E NÃO FAZ QUAISQUER DECLARAÇÕES OU PRESTA GARANTIAS DE QUALQUER TIPO EM RELAÇÃO AO TRABALHO, SEJAM EXPRESSAS OU IMPLÍCITAS, LEGAIS OU OUTRAS, INCLUINDO, SEM LIMITAÇÃO, QUAISQUER GARANTIAS SOBRE A TITULARIDADE DO TRABALHO, POTENCIALIDADE COMERCIAL, ADEQUAÇÃO A UM FIM ESPECÍFICO, LEGALIDADE, AUSÊNCIA DE DEFEITOS LATENTES OU OUTROS, EXATIDÃO, EXISTÊNCIA OU AUSÊNCIA DE ERROS, SEJAM ELES APARENTES OU OCULTOS. ALGUMAS JURISDIÇÕES NÃO ADMITEM A EXCLUSÃO DE GARANTIAS IMPLÍCITAS, PELO QUE TAL EXCLUSÃO PODERÁ NÃO SER APLICÁVEL AO UTILIZADOR.
6. Limitação de Responsabilidade. EXCETO NA EXTENSÃO EXIGIDA PELA LEGISLAÇÃO APLICÁVEL, EM NENHUMA CIRCUNSTÂNCIA O LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PARA COM O UTILIZADOR, COM BASE EM NENHUMA TEORIA JURÍDICA, POR QUAISQUER DANOS, GERAIS OU ESPECIAIS (INCLUINDO DANOS EMERGENTES E LUCROS CESSANTES), INCIDENTAIS OU CONSEQUENCIAIS, PUNITIVOS OU EXEMPLARES, QUE RESULTEM DA PRESENTE LICENÇA OU DA UTILIZAÇÃO DO TRABALHO, AINDA QUE O LICENCIANTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO SOBRE A POSSIBILIDADE DE OCORRÊNCIA DE TAIS DANOS.
7. Cessação
A presente Licença e os direitos concedidos pela mesma cessarão automaticamente em caso de qualquer violação dos termos desta Licença pelo Utilizador. Os indivíduos ou entidades que tenham recebido do Utilizador Trabalhos Derivados ou Coleções sob esta Licença, não terão, no entanto, as suas licenças cessadas, se permanecerem em total cumprimento com os termos dessas licenças. As Secções 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 subsistirão a qualquer cessação desta Licença.
Sujeita aos termos e condições acima expostos, a presente Licença é válida pelo período de duração do direito de autor ou do direito conexo aplicável ao Trabalho previsto na Legislação Aplicável. Sem prejuízo do disposto na frase anterior, o Licenciante reserva-se ao direito de divulgar ou publicar o Trabalho sob termos e condições de licenciamento diferentes dos da presente Licença, ou de deixar, a qualquer momento, de Distribuir o Trabalho; desde que, no entanto, quaisquer dessas ações não sirva como meio de fazer cessar esta Licença (ou qualquer outra licença que tenha sido ou que deva ser concedida sob os termos desta Licença), a qual continuará plenamente válida e eficaz, a não ser que seja terminada de acordo com o acima disposto.
Para evitar qualquer dúvida, deve esclarecer-se que nada no disposto nas Secções 7(a) 7(b) poderá afetar o direito moral de retirada de circulação da obra literária ou artística assegurado ao Autor pela Legislação Aplicável, o qual só poderá, no entanto, ser exercido sob os termos e condições previstos nessa Legislação.
8. Outras Disposições
Cada vez que o Utilizador distribua ou apresente ao público o Trabalho, ou uma Coleção, o Licenciante concederá ao destinatário uma licença de utilização do Trabalho objeto desta Licença com os mesmos termos e condições que foram concedidos ao Utilizador sob a presente Licença.
Cada vez que o Utilizador distribua ou apresente ao público um Trabalho Derivado, o Licenciante concederá ao destinatário uma licença de utilização do Trabalho objeto desta Licença com os mesmos termos e condições que foram concedidos ao Utilizador sob a presente Licença.
Caso alguma disposição desta Licença seja tida como inválida ou não executória ao abrigo da Legislação Aplicável, tal não afetará a validade ou a possibilidade de execução dos restantes termos desta Licença e, sem necessidade de qualquer ação adicional das partes deste acordo, tal disposição será alterada na medida necessária para que se torne válida e executável.
Nenhum termo ou disposição desta Licença será considerado renunciado e nenhuma violação será considerada consentida, a não ser que tal renúncia ou consentimento seja feito por escrito e assinado pela parte que seja afetada por tal renúncia ou consentimento.
Esta Licença representa o acordo integral entre as partes relativamente ao Trabalho objeto desta Licença. Não existem entendimentos, acordos ou declarações relativos ao Trabalho que não estejam aqui especificados. O Licenciante não será obrigado por nenhuma disposição adicional que possa resultar de qualquer comunicação proveniente do Utilizador.

Organizaţia Creative Commons (denumită în continuare „Creative Commons”) nu este o firmă de avocatură şi nu acordă servicii de asistenţă juridică. Distribuirea acestei licenţe nu creează o relaţie de tip Avocat-Client. Creative Commons oferă această formă de licenţă, aşa cum este aceasta prezentată în cele ce urmează. Creative Commons nu îşi asumă răspunderea pentru daunele rezultate din conţinutul sau utilizarea acestei licenţe.
Licenţa
Opera (aşa cum este definită mai jos) este furnizată în condiţiile acestei Licenţe Publice Creative Commons (denumită în continuare „LPCC” sau „licenţă”). Opera este protejată de legea privind drepturile de autor şi drepturile conexe şi de celelalte norme de drept aplicabile. Orice utilizare a Operei în afara celei autorizate prin această licenţă sau prin legislaţia în vigoare este interzisă.
Exercitarea oricăror drepturi prevăzute de prezenta licenţă asupra Operei presupune acceptarea licenţei. Conform termenilor şi obligaţiilor din prezenta licenţă, în măsura în care prezenta licenţă poate fi considerată un contract, Licenţiatorul propune Licenţiatului exercitarea drepturilor menţionate mai jos, iar Licenţiatul este de acord cu termenii şi condiţiile licenţei.
1. Definiţii
"Opera" desemnează opera originală de creaţie intelectuală susceptibilă de protecţie prin dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe, furnizată în condiţiile prezenţei licenţe. În cadrul acestei licenţe, prin Operă se înţelege şi o fonogramă (culegere de opere fixate pe fonogramă), o videogramă (culegere de opere fixate pe o videogramă), un program de radiodifuziune ori de televiziune, precum şi o bază de date în conformitate cu definiţiile din legislaţia în vigoare privind drepturile de autor şi drepturile conexe, cu condiţia ca o asemenea fonogramă, videogramă, program de radiodifuziune ori de televiziune sau bază de date să fie protejate de legea aplicabilă.
"Adaptare" desemnează o Operă creată pe baza unei alte Opere sau pe baza unei Opere şi a unor alte Opere preexistente, aşa cum sunt traducerile, adaptările, operele derivate, aranjamentele muzicale sau alte alterări ale unor opere literare sau artistice sau ale unor fonograme sau comunicări publice, incluzând adaptările cinematografice sau orice alte adaptări prin care Opera poate fi modificată, transformată sau adaptată, incluzând, în orice formă, părţi uşor de recunoscut ale originalului. Fac excepţie Colecţiile, care nu vor fi considerate Adaptări potrivit scopului prezentei licenţe. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, atunci când Opera este o creaţie muzicală, interpretare muzicală sau fonogramă, sincronizarea acesteia în relaţie temporală cu o imagine aflată în mişcare ("sincronizare") va fi considerată Adaptare potrivit prezentei licenţe.
"Colecţie" desemnează un cumul de Opere literare sau artistice, aşa cum sunt enciclopediile şi antologiile, precum şi orice alte Opere sau subiecte, altele decât Operele enumerate la articolul 1 litera (a). Acestea, prin selecţia şi aranjamentul conţinutului lor, constituie creaţii intelectuale în care o Operă este inclusă în integralitatea ei în noua Operă, alături de una sau mai multe contribuţii, fiecare reprezentând Opere separate şi independente, care împreună dobândesc o formă colectivă. În sensul acestui contract, o Operă care constituie o Colecţie nu va fi considerată Adaptare.
"Autorul" desemnează, în cazul unei Opere literare sau artistice, persoana sau persoanele fizice care au creat Opera.
"Titularul de drepturi conexe" desemnează persoana fizică sau juridică, titular de drepturi conexe dreptului de autor, care poate fi: (i) artisti interpret sau executant, în cazul execuţiei sau interpretării; (ii) producător de înregistrări sonore şi de înregistrări audiovizuale, în cazul unei fonograme sau respectiv videograme; sau (iii) organism de radiodifuziune şi televiziune, în cazul programelor de radiodifuziune şi televiziune. În cadrul acestei licenţe, prin titular de drepturi conexe se va înţelege şi fabricantul unei baze de date.
"Licenţiatorul" desemnează persoana sau persoanele fizice şi/sau juridice care pun la dispoziţie Opera, în condiţiile prezentei licenţe.
"Licenţiatul" desemnează persoana fizică şi/sau persoana juridică care acceptă prezenta licenţă şi exercită drepturile acordate, fără să fi încălcat în prealabil termenii licenţei, sau care a primit permisiunea expresă a Licenţiatorului de a exercita drepturile conferite prin prezenta licenţă, în pofida unei încălcări anterioare a prevederilor acesteia.
"Comunicare publică" desemnează orice comunicare a unei Opere, realizată direct sau prin orice mijloace tehnice, făcută într-un loc accesibil publicului sau în orice loc în care se adună un număr de persoane care depăşeşte cercul normal al membrilor unei familii şi al cunoştinţelor acesteia, inclusiv reprezentarea scenică, recitarea sau orice altă modalitate publică de execuţie ori de prezentare directă a Operei, expunerea publică a Operelor de artă plastică, de artă aplicată, fotografică şi de arhitectură, proiecţia publică a Operelor cinematografice şi a altor Opere audiovizuale, inclusiv a Operelor de artă digitală, prezentarea într-un loc public, prin intermediul înregistrărilor sonore sau audiovizuale, precum şi prezentarea într-un loc public, prin intermediul oricăror mijloace, a unei Opere radiodifuzate. De asemenea, se consideră publică orice comunicare a unei Opere, prin mijloace cu fir sau fără fir, realizată prin punerea la dispoziţia publicului, inclusiv prin Internet sau alte reţele de calculatoare, astfel încât oricare dintre membrii publicului să poată avea acces la aceasta din orice loc sau în orice moment ales în mod individual.
"Distribuire" desemnează orice mod de transmitere a originalului sau a copiilor unei Opere sau Adaptări, precum şi oferirea publică a acestora.
"Reproducere" desemnează realizarea, integrală sau parţială, a uneia ori a mai multor copii ale unei Opere, direct sau indirect, temporar ori permanent, prin orice mijloc şi sub orice formă, inclusiv realizarea oricărei înregistrări sonore sau audiovizuale a unei Opere, precum şi stocarea permanentă ori temporară a acesteia prin mijloace electronice.
"Opţiunile licenţei" desemnează următoarele atribute importante ale licenţei, aşa cum au fost acestea selectate de către Licenţiator şi cum sunt indicate în titlul prezentei licenţe: Atribuire.
2. Limitele exercitării dreptului de autor. Nicio prevedere a acestei licenţe nu are scopul de a reduce, de a limita sau de a restrânge drepturile rezultate din aplicarea normelor legale cu privire la limitele exercitării dreptului de autor prevăzute de legislaţia privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe sau de alte legi aplicabile.
3. Autorizare. În condiţiile definite prin prezenta licenţă şi pe întreaga durată de protecţie a Operei prevăzută de legislaţia privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe, Licenţiatorul acordă Licenţiatului în mod neexclusiv, nelimitat teritorial şi cu titlu gratuit autorizarea de a exercita următoarele drepturi:
dreptul de a reproduce Opera, de a o încorpora într-una sau mai multe Colecţii şi de a reproduce Opera aşa cum a fost aceasta încorporată într-o Colecţie;
dreptul de a crea şi de a reproduce Adaptări;
dreptul de a distribui şi comunica public Opera, inclusiv încorporată în Colecţii;
dreptul de a distribui şi comunica public Adaptări;
în cazul în care opera este o bază de date, dreptul de a extrage şi/sau a reutiliza părţi substanţiale din Operă;
Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, trebuie să notăm:  
Regim legal obligatoriu de gestiune colectivă. În cazul în care un tip de utilizare a Operei ar fi supus unui regim legal obligatoriu de gestiune colectivă (de ex. dreptul la remuneraţie compensatorie pentru copia privată), Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul exclusiv de a colecta remuneraţiile respective prin intermediul organismului de gestiune colectivă competent, atât în cazul utilizării comerciale, cât şi în cazul utilizării necomerciale a Operei;
Regim legal facultativ de gestiune colectivă. În cazul în care un tip de utilizare a Operei ar fi supus unui regim legal facultativ de gestiune colectivă (de ex. dreptul de împrumut), Licenţiatorul renunţă la dreptul de a colecta aceste remuneraţii pentru orice exercitare de către Licenţiat a drepturilor obţinute prin prezenta licenţă;
Gestiunea colectivă a drepturilor. Licenţiatorul renunţă, acolo unde legea permite, la dreptul de a colecta remuneraţiile (independent sau, când Licenţiatorul este un membru al unui organism de gestiune colectivă, prin acesta) pentru orice exercitare de către Licenţiat a drepturilor obţinute prin prezenta licenţă.
Drepturile menţionate mai sus pot fi exercitate în cazul tuturor mediilor de stocare şi formatelor cunoscute. Drepturile menţionate mai sus includ şi dreptul de a face modificările tehnice corespunzătoare necesare exercitării acestora în cazul altor medii de stocare sau formate. Toate drepturile care nu sunt expres acordate de Licenţiator sau asupra cărora Licenţiatorul nu are dreptul de gestiune rămân rezervate, în special în cazurile de gestiune colectivă obligatorie aplicabile menţionate la articolul 4 litera (d). Daca Licenţiatorul este titularul drepturilor sui-generis asupra unei baze de date, în conformitate cu legea naţională care implementează Directiva Europeană privind Bazele de Date, Licenţiatorul va renunţa la aceste drepturi.
4. Restricţii. Licenţa, acordată în conformitate cu articolul 3, se încheie sub condiţia respectării următoarelor restricţii:
Licenţiatul poate distribui sau comunica public Opera numai în condiţiile prezentei licenţe. Licenţiatul este obligat să includă o copie a licenţei sau adresa acesteia pe Internet (U.R.I. - Uniform Resource Identifier) împreună cu fiecare copie a Operei care este distribuită sau comunicată public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a oferi sau impune nicio condiţie asupra Operei, care să modifice sau să restricţioneze prevederile acestei licenţe sau exercitarea drepturilor terţilor dobânditori, aşa cum sunt acestea prevăzute în prezenta licenţă. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a sublicenţia Opera. Licenţiatul este obligat să păstreze intacte toate notificările care se referă la prezenta licenţă şi la exonerarea de răspundere din fiecare copie a Operei pe care o distribuie sau comunică public. Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a distribui sau de a comunica public Opera folosind măsuri tehnice de protecţie care restrâng posibilitatea terţilor dobânditori de a-şi exercita drepturile obţinute în condiţiile prezentei licenţe. Prezenta literă (a) se aplică Operei încorporate într-o Colecţie, dar nu se extinde în mod obligatoriu asupra celorlalte Opere conţinute în Colecţie. Dacă Licenţiatul creează o Colecţie, acesta este obligat, la notificarea oricărui Licenţiator, în măsura în care este posibil, să înlăture din Colecţie orice referinţă la respectivul Licenţiator, la Titularul de drepturi conexe sau la Autorul Operei, astfel cum se specifică la articolul 4 litera (b). Dacă Licenţiatul creează o Adaptare, acesta este obligat, la notificarea oricărui Licenţiator, în măsura în care este posibil, să înlăture din Adaptare orice referinţă la respectivul Licenţiator, la Titularul de drepturi conexe sau la Autorul Operei , astfel cum se specifică la articolul 3 litera (b).
În cazul în care Licenţiatul distribuie sau comunică public Opera sau orice Adaptare sau Colecţie, Licenţiatul este obligat, cu excepţia cererilor făcute în baza articolului 4 litera (a), să păstreze intacte toate informaţiile sau notificările privind drepturile de autor sau conexe asupra Operei şi să furnizeze următoarele informaţii, în funcţie de mediul sau mijloacele utilizate: (i) numele Autorului şi/sau al Titularului de drepturi conexe (sau pseudonimul, după caz), dacă acesta a fost adus la cunoştinţă, şi/sau numele părţii desemnate de Autor, Titular de Drepturi Conexe şi/sau de Licenţiator pentru atribuirea Operei, în notificările Licenţiatorului privind drepturile de autor, condiţiile de utilizare sau alte menţiuni disponibile; (ii) titlul Operei, dacă este furnizat; (iii) în măsura în care este posibil şi dacă există, adresa pe Internet (U.R.I.) pe care Licenţiatorul o desemnează pentru a fi asociată cu Opera, cu excepţia cazului în care această adresă nu se referă la informaţiile privind paternitatea Operei şi condiţiile de utilizare a Operei; şi (iv) în conformitate cu articolul 3 litera (b), în cazul unei Adaptări, o menţiune care să identifice utilizarea Operei în Adaptare (de ex. „traducere în limba romană a Operei Autorului” sau „scenariu bazat pe Opera originală a Autorului”). Menţiunea cerută la prezenta literă (c) poate fi introdusă în orice modalitate adecvată; cu toate acestea, în cazul unei Adaptări sau Colecţii, dacă apar menţiuni similare pentru toţi Autorii care contribuie la Adaptare sau Colecţie, cel puţin o astfel de menţiune este necesar a fi introdusă alături de celelalte menţiuni şi în aceeaşi măsură ca pentru ceilalţi Autori. Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri, Licenţiatul poate folosi menţiunea cerută în această secţiune doar în scopul atribuirii în modalitatea prevăzută anterior, iar în scopul exercitării drepturilor în condiţiile prezentei licenţe, Licenţiatul nu are dreptul de a susţine sau a sugera, direct sau indirect, orice legătură, finanţare sau susţinere din partea Autorului, Titularului de Drepturi Conexe, Licenţiatorului şi/sau părţii desemnate de aceştia pentru atribuire, după caz, pentru Licenţiat sau utilizarea Operei de către Licenţiat, cu excepţia permisiunilor separate, exprese, acordate în scris şi anterior de către Autor, Titularul de drepturi conexe, Licenţiator şi/sau partea desemnată de aceştia pentru atribuire.
Pentru evitarea oricărei neînţelegeri: Restricţiile menţionate la litera (a) şi (b) nu se aplică acelor Opere care îndeplinesc doar criteriul dreptului sui generis asupra unei baze de date în conformitate cu legea română privind dreptul de autor şi drepturile conexe.
Drepturile morale rămân nemodificate, în măsura în care sunt recunoscute şi nu pot face obliectul unor renunţări în conformitate cu legea aplicabilă.
5. Garanţie şi exonerarea de răspundere 
Prin punerea Operei la dispoziţia publicului în conformitate cu dispoziţiile prezentei licenţe, Licenţiatorul declară de bună credinţă că, în conformitate cu ceea ce cunoaşte şi în limite rezonabile:  
Licenţiatorul a obţinut toate drepturile necesare asupra Operei pentru a putea autoriza exerciţiul drepturilor acordate prin prezenta licenţă şi a permite utilizarea netulburată şi exerciţiul licit al acestor drepturi, aceasta fără ca Licenţiatul să aibă o obligaţie de a plăti vreo remuneraţie, cu excepţia celor prevăzute de mecanismele de gestiune colectivă obligatorie descrise la articolul 3 litera (f);
Opera nu dă naştere vreunei încălcări a drepturilor unor terţe persoane, în special drepturi de autor sau drepturi conexe, drepturi privind mărcile, drepturi privind informaţia, drepturi patrimoniale sau oricare alte drepturi, şi nici vreunei defăimări, violări a dreptului la viaţa privată sau vreunui alt fapt ilicit cu privire la oricare altă terţă parte.
Cu excepţia cazurilor prevăzute expres în prezenta licenţă sau într-un alt acord scris, sau cerute de legea aplicabilă, Opera este pusă la dispoziţie fără vreo garanţie de orice fel, expresă sau tacită, inclusiv în ceea ce priveşte conţinutul Operei sau exactitatea acesteia.
6. Limitarea răspunderii. Cu excepţia răspunderii cerută de normele imperative ale legii aplicabile şi a reparării prejudiciilor impuse de răspunderea faţă de terţi generată de încălcarea garanţiilor prevăzute la articolul 5, Licenţiatorul nu va fi responsabil faţa de Licenţiat, în temeiul niciunei doctrine juridice, pentru orice prejudicii directe, indirecte, materiale sau morale care decurg din această licenţă sau din utilizarea Operei, chiar dacă Licenţiatorul a fost avertizat asupra posibilităţii producerii unor asemenea prejudicii.
7. Rezilierea licenţei
Această licenţă este reziliată de plin drept, iar drepturile acordate prin intermediul său vor înceta în mod implicit în cazul în care Licenţiatul săvârşeşte orice fel de încălcare a condiţiilor licenţei. Licenţele prin care persoane fizice sau persoane juridice au dobândit de la Licenţiat Adaptări sau Colecţii, în condiţiile acestei licenţe, nu vor fi reziliate, atât timp cât respectivii dobânditori vor respecta condiţiile sub care le-au fost acordate drepturile respective. Articolele 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 şi 8 rămân aplicabile chiar după rezilierea prezentei licenţe.
În limitele indicate mai sus, prezenta licenţă se aplică pe întreaga durată de protecţie a Operei conform legii aplicabile. Cu toate acestea, Licenţiatorul îşi rezervă dreptul de a exploata Opera şi în alte condiţii contractuale sau de a înceta oricând distribuirea Operei; totuşi, utilizarea acestei opţiuni a Licenţiatorului nu va conduce la restrângerea efectelor prezentei licenţe (sau a oricărei alte licenţe care a fost sau trebuie să fie acordată conform condiţiilor prezentei licenţe), iar licenţa va continua să producă efecte depline, până la rezilierea sa în baza prevederilor menţionate mai sus.
8. Alte prevederi
Cu fiecare reproducere sau comunicare publică în format digital de către Licenţiat a Operei sau a unei Colecţii, Licenţiatorul face primitorului o ofertă de licenţă având ca obiect Opera, conţinând aceleaşi condiţii ca şi prezenta licenţă încheiată cu Licenţiatul.
Cu fiecare reproducere sau comunicare publică în format digital de către Licenţiat a Adaptării, Licenţiatorul face primitorului o ofertă de licenţă având ca obiect Opera originală, conţinând aceleaşi condiţii ca şi prezenta licenţă încheiată cu Licenţiatul.
Dacă o prevedere a prezentei licenţe este nulă sau inaplicabilă conform legislaţiei în vigoare, validitatea sau aplicabilitatea celorlalte dispoziţii ale licenţei nu va fi afectată. Fără a fi necesare alte acţiuni ale părţilor la prezenta licenţă, prevederile nule sau inaplicabile vor fi interpretate în măsura minimă necesară pentru a deveni valide şi aplicabile.
Nu se va considera că s-a renunţat la vreo prevedere a prezentei licenţe sau la invocarea încălcării acesteia, cu excepţia cazului în care o astfel de renunţare este în scris şi semnată de partea care suportă consecinţele renunţării sau invocării încălcării.
Prezenta licenţă constituie convenţia părţilor în întregul său asupra Operei astfel licenţiate. Nu există alte înţelegeri, acorduri sau dispoziţii privind Opera care să nu fie specificate prin prezenta licenţă. Licenţiatorul nu va fi subiect al niciunei dispoziţii suplimentare comunicate de către Licenţiat. Prezenta licenţă nu poate fi modificată fără acordul mutual scris al Licenţiatorului şi al Licenţiatului.
Dreptul aplicabil este dreptul român.

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

4. Restricciones. La licencia otorgada en la Sección anterior 3 está expresamente sujeta y limitada por las siguientes restricciones:
El Licenciatario puede Distribuir o Comunicar Públicamente la Obra sólo bajo los términos de esta Licencia. El Licenciatario debe incluir el Identificador Uniforme de Recurso (URI), o una copia de la Licencia, con cada copia de la Obra que Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente. No es posible imponer ninguna condición sobre la Obra que restrinja los términos de esta Licencia o el ejercicio de los derechos otorgados a los beneficiarios. El Licenciatario no puede sublicenciar la Obra. El Licenciatario debe mantener intactos todos los anuncios que se refieran a esta Licencia y a la ausencia de garantías en cada copia de la Obra que el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente. Cuando el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente la Obra, el Licenciatario no podrá imponer ninguna medida tecnológica efectiva que restrinja la capacidad de un beneficiario de la Obra de ejercer los derechos otorgados a dicho beneficiario según los términos de esta Licencia. Esta Sección 4 (a) se aplica a la Obra incorporada en una Colección, pero esto no exige que la Colección, aparte de la Obra misma, quede sujeta a los términos de esta Licencia. Si el Licenciatario crea una Colección o una Obra Derivada, previo aviso de cualquier Licenciante, deberá, en la medida de lo posible, quitar de la Colección o de la Obra Derivada cualquier crédito requerido en la Sección 4 (b), conforme a lo solicitado.
Si el Licenciatario Distribuye o Comunica Públicamente la Obra o la Obra Derivada o las Colecciones, el Licenciatario debe, a menos que se haya presentado una solicitud de conformidad con la Sección 4 (a), mantener intactos todos los avisos de derechos de autor de la Obra y proporcionar, de forma razonable con el medio o los medios que el Licenciatario está utilizando: (i) el nombre del Autor Original (o seudónimo, en su caso), y/o si el autor o Licenciante ofrece, el nombre de las partes (por ejemplo, organización de hospedaje, de publicación, editorial, revista) para designar la atribución ("Partes Reconocidas") como se reconoce en el presente aviso legal, términos de uso o cualquier otra manera razonable; (ii) el título de la Obra si fue suministrado; (iii) en la medida de lo razonablemente posible, la URI, si existiese, que el Licenciante haya especificado como asociada a la obra, salvo que tal URI no se refiera al aviso de derechos de autor o a la información sobre la Licencia de la Obra; y, (iv) de conformidad con la Sección 3 (b), en el caso de una Obra Derivada, un aviso que identifique el uso de la Obra en la Obra Derivada (por ejemplo, "Traducción Francesa de la Obra del Autor Original," o “guión basado en la Obra original del Autor Original"). El crédito requerido por esta Sección 4 (b) puede ser implementado de cualquier forma razonable, prevista, sin embargo, que en el caso de una Obra Derivada o de una Colección, tal crédito debe aparecer, como mínimo, como parte de los créditos correspondientes a los demás autores que contribuyeron, y de una manera igual de destacada. Para evitar dudas, el Licenciatario sólo podrá utilizar el crédito requerido por esta Sección 4 (b) con el propósito de la atribución en la manera anteriormente descrita y, al ejercer los derechos otorgados bajo esta Licencia, el Licenciatario no podrá implícita o explícitamente afirmar o implicar ninguna conexión, patrocinio o respaldo por parte del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Partes Reconocidas, según corresponda, del uso de la Obra, sin el permiso independiente, expreso, previo y por escrito del Autor Original, Licenciante y/o Partes Reconocidas.
Los derechos morales no se ven afectados por esta Licencia en la medida en que sean reconocidos y no se puedan renunciar, de acuerdo con la ley aplicable.
5. Representaciones, Garantías y Exención de Responsabilidades
SALVO MUTUO ACUERDO POR ESCRITO ENTRE LAS PARTES, Y EN TODA LA EXTENSIÓN PERMITIDA POR LA LEY APLICABLE, EL LICENCIANTE OFRECE LA OBRA TAL COMO ES Y SIN BRINDAR GARANTÍAS DE NINGÚN TIPO RESPECTO DE LA OBRA, YA SEA EXPRESA, IMPLÍCITA, POR LEY O DE OTRA MANERA, INCLUYENDO, SIN LIMITACIONES, LAS GARANTÍAS DE TITUTLARIDAD, COMERCIALIZACIÓN, IDONEIDAD PARA UN PROPÓSITO PARTICULAR, INFRACCIÓN, O LA AUSENCIA DE DEFECTOS LATENTES, EXACTITUD, O LA PRESENCIA O AUSENCIA DE ERRORES, SEAN O NO DESCUBRIBLES. ALGUNAS JURISDICCIONES NO PERMITEN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE GARANTÍAS, POR LO QUE PUEDE NO SER APLICABLE AL LICENCIATARIO.
6. Limitación de Responsabilidad. EL LICENCIANTE NO SERÁ RESPONSABLE FRENTE AL LICENCIATARIO POR DAÑO ALGUNO, SEA POR RESPONSABILIDAD EXTRACONTRACTUAL O CONTRACTUAL, OBJETIVA O SUBJETIVA, SE TRATE DE DAÑOS MORALES O PATRIMONIALES, DIRECTOS O INDIRECTOS, PREVISTOS O IMPREVISTOS, PRODUCIDOS POR EL USO DE ESTA LICENCIA O DE LA OBRA, AÚN CUANDO EL LICENCIANTE HAYA SIDO ADVERTIDO DE LA POSIBILIDAD DE DICHOS DAÑOS, SALVO QUE ALGUNAS LEYES NO PERMITAN LA EXCLUSIÓN DE CIERTA RESPONSABILIDAD Y/Ó PREVEAN EXPRESAMENTE EL DERECHO DE INDEMNIZACIÓN A FAVOR DEL LICENCIATARIO, EN CUYO CASO ESTA EXCLUSIÓN NO SERÁ APLICABLE.
7. Terminación
La presente Licencia y los derechos aquí concedidos finalizarán automáticamente por el incumplimiento del Licenciatario de los términos de esta Licencia. Las personas o entidades que hayan recibido del Licenciatario Obras Derivadas o las Colecciones bajo esta Licencia, sin embargo, no verán anuladas sus licencias siempre que tales personas o entidades se mantengan en pleno cumplimiento de aquellas licencias. Las secciones 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, y 8 subsistirán a la terminación de esta Licencia.
Sujeta a los términos y condiciones anteriores, la licencia aquí otorgada es perpetua (por la duración de los derechos de autor de la Obra). No obstante lo anterior, el Licenciante se reserva el derecho de difundir la Obra bajo diferentes términos de licencia o a dejar de distribuirla en cualquier momento, con la salvedad de que tal elección no podrá revocar esta Licencia (ni ninguna otra licencia que haya sido o deba ser concedida bajo los términos de ésta) y que esta Licencia continuará en pleno vigor y efecto a menos que sea finalizada conforme a lo establecido anteriormente.
8. Varios
Cada vez que el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente la Obra o una Colección, el Licenciante ofrecerá al beneficiario una licencia para la Obra en los mismos términos y condiciones que la que aquí se otorga.
Cada vez que el Licenciatario Distribuya o Comunique Públicamente una Obra Derivada, el Licenciante ofrecerá al beneficiario una licencia para la Obra original en los mismos términos y condiciones que la licencia otorgada al Licenciatario bajo esta Licencia.
Si alguna disposición de esta Licencia es inválida o no exigible bajo la ley aplicable, esto no afectará la validez o aplicabilidad del resto de los términos de esta Licencia y, sin más acción de las partes de este acuerdo, tal disposición se entenderá reformada en la medida mínima necesaria para que sea válida y exigible.
Ninguna de las disposiciones de esta Licencia se considerará renunciable, ni se consentirá violación alguna de ellas, a menos que tal renuncia o consentimiento sea por escrito y firmado por las partes que serán afectadas por tal renuncia o consentimiento.
La presente Licencia constituye el acuerdo completo entre las partes respecto a la Obra aquí licenciada. No hay entendimientos, acuerdos o condiciones respecto a la Obra que no estén especificados aquí.

Los derechos acá concedidos, y objeto de la materia referenciada, en la presente Licencia se elaboraron utilizando la terminología de la Ley sobre el Derecho de Autor de Venezuela promulgada el 14 de agosto de 1993, y el Reglamento de la Ley Sobre el Derecho de Autor de fecha 09 de septiembre de 1997, la Ley Orgánica del Trabajo, los Trabajadores y las Trabajadoras promulgada en fecha 8 de mayo de 2012 en lo concerniente al Derecho de Autor, la Ley Aprobatoria de Adhesión de Venezuela a la Convención de Berna para la Protección de las Obras Literarias y Artísticas (tal como fue promulgada el 12 de mayo de 1982), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de Roma de 1961 (promulgada 13 de septiembre de 1995), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de París (promulgada el 12 de septiembre de 1995), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de Ginebra (promulgada el 18 de noviembre de 1982), la Ley Aprobatoria del Convenio de la OMPI (promulgada el 23 de noviembre 1984), la Ley Aprobatoria del Tratado de la OMPI (promulgada el 20 de diciembre de 1996), y la Ley Aprobatoria de la Convención Universal de Copyright (promulgada el 19 de octubre, 1995).

Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.
License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 – License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.
Attribution.
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.
This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

Creative Commons Nimeä 4.0 Kansainvälinen Julkinen Lisenssi
Käyttämällä Lisensoituja Oikeuksia (määritelty alla) Sinä hyväksyt tämän Creative Commons Nimeä 4.0 Kansainvälisen Julkisen Lisenssin (Julkinen Lisenssi) ehdot ja sitoudut noudattamaan niitä. Siinä laajuudessa kuin tämä Julkinen Lisenssi voidaan tulkita sopimukseksi, Lisensoidut Oikeudet myönnetään Sinulle vastineena siitä, että Sinä hyväksyt nämä ehdot, ja Lisenssinantaja myöntää Sinulle kyseiset oikeudet vastineena niistä eduista, jotka Lisenssinantaja saa asettamalla Lisensoidun Aineiston saataville näillä ehdoilla.
Osa 1 – Määritelmät.
Muunneltu Aineisto tarkoittaa aineistoa, joka on Tekijänoikeuden ja Samankaltaisten Oikeuksien alaista ja joka on johdettu Lisensoidusta Aineistosta tai joka perustuu Lisensoituun Aineistoon ja jossa Lisensoitu Aineisto on käännetty, muutettu, sovitettu, muunnettu tai muulla tavoin muokattu tavalla, joka vaatii luvan Lisenssinantajan hallitsemien Tekijänoikeuksien ja Samankaltaisten Oikeuksien nojalla. Kun Lisensoitu Aineisto on sävellysteos, esitys tai äänitys, tätä Julkista Lisenssiä käytettäessä ja tulkittaessa katsotaan, että Muunneltua Aineistoa syntyy aina kun Lisensoitua Aineistoa ajastetaan liikkuvaan kuvaan.
Muuntelijan Lisenssi tarkoittaa lisenssiä, jonka Sinä myönnät Sinun tekemiisi, Sinun Tekijänoikeuden ja Samankaltaisten Oikeuksiesi alaisiin Muunnellun Aineiston osiin tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehtojen mukaisesti.
Tekijänoikeus ja Samankaltaiset Oikeudet tarkoittavat tekijänoikeutta ja/tai siihen läheisesti liittyviä samankaltaisia oikeuksia, kuten esimerkiksi esityksiä, lähetyksiä ja äänitallenteita koskevat oikeudet sekä Sui Generis Tietokantaoikeudet, riippumatta siitä, kuinka nämä oikeudet on nimetty tai luokiteltu. Tätä Julkista Lisenssiä käytettäessä ja tulkittaessa katsotaan, että kohdissa 2(b)(1) - (2) määritellyt oikeudet eivät kuulu Tekijänoikeuteen ja Samankaltaisiin Oikeuksiin.
Tehokkaat Tekniset Toimenpiteet tarkoittavat sellaisia toimenpiteitä, joiden kiertäminen ilman asianmukaisia valtuuksia on kielletty laeilla, joilla on toimeenpantu 20.12.1996 solmitun WIPO:n tekijänoikeussopimuksen 11 artiklan ja/tai muiden samankaltaisten kansainvälisten sopimusten mukaiset velvollisuudet.
Poikkeukset ja Rajoitukset tarkoittavat fair use ja fair dealing -poikkeuksia ja/tai mitä tahansa muuta Tekijänoikeuteen ja Samankaltaisiin Oikeuksiin kohdistuvaa poikkeusta tai rajoitusta, joka koskee Sinun Lisensoidun Aineiston käyttöäsi.
Lisensoitu Aineisto tarkoittaa taiteellista tai kirjallista teosta, tietokantaa tai muuta aineistoa, johon Lisenssinantaja on myöntänyt lisenssin tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehdoin.
Lisensoidut Oikeudet tarkoittavat Sinulle tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehtojen mukaisesti myönnettyjä oikeuksia rajoittuen kaikkiin sellaisiin Tekijänoikeuksiin ja Samankaltaisiin Oikeuksiin, jotka koskevat Sinun Lisensoidun Aineiston käyttöäsi ja joihin Lisenssinantaja on oikeutettu myöntämään lisenssin.
Lisenssinantaja tarkoittaa yhtä tai useampaa luonnollista tai oikeushenkilöä, joka myöntää tämän Julkisen Lisenssin mukaiset oikeudet.
Jakaa tarkoittaa aineiston tarjoamista yleisölle millä tahansa sellaisella keinolla tai tavalla, joka vaatii luvan Lisensoitujen Oikeuksien nojalla, kuten valmistamalla kappaleita, julkisesti näyttämällä, julkisesti esittämällä, levittämällä, jakamalla, välittämällä tai maahantuomalla, sekä aineiston saattamista yleisön saataville, mukaan lukien sellaisilla keinoilla ja tavoilla, joiden avulla yleisöön kuuluvilla henkilöillä on mahdollisuus saada aineisto saataviinsa itse valitsemastaan paikasta ja itse valitsemanaan aikana.
Sui Generis Tietokantaoikeudet tarkoittavat sellaisia muita oikeuksia kuin tekijänoikeutta, jotka perustuvat Euroopan parlamentin ja neuvoston 11.3.1996 antamaan direktiiviin 96/9/EY tietokantojen oikeudellisesta suojasta, ottaen huomioon direktiivin muutokset ja/tai sen sijaan tulleet säännökset, sekä muita olennaisesti vastaavia oikeuksia muualla maailmassa.
Sinä tarkoittaa luonnollista tai oikeushenkilöä, joka käyttää Lisensoituja Oikeuksia tämän Julkisen Lisenssin nojalla. Sanoilla Sinun, Sinua, Sinulle, Sinulla, Sinulta ja Sinuun on vastaava merkitys.
Osa 2 – Lisenssin laajuus.
Lisenssin myöntäminen.
Lisenssinantaja myöntää Sinulle tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehtojen mukaisesti maailmanlaajuisen, rojaltivapaan ja peruuttamattoman lisenssin ilman alilisensointi- tai yksinoikeutta. Sinä voit käyttää Lisensoituun Aineistoon kohdistuvia Lisensoituja Oikeuksia seuraavasti:
valmistaa kappaleita Lisensoidusta Aineistosta ja Jakaa Lisensoitua Aineistoa, osaksi tai kokonaisuudessaan; sekä
tuottaa Muunneltua Aineistoa, valmistaa Muunnellusta Aineistosta kappaleita ja Jakaa Muunneltua Aineistoa.
Poikkeukset ja Rajoitukset. Selvyyden vuoksi todettakoon, että silloin kun Sinun käyttöösi soveltuu Poikkeuksia ja Rajoituksia, tämä Julkinen Lisenssi ei sovellu, eikä Sinun tarvitse noudattaa tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehtoja.
Voimassaoloaika. Tämän Julkisen Lisenssin voimassaoloaika on määritelty kohdassa 6(a).
Välineet ja muodot; tekniset muutokset ovat sallittuja. Lisenssinantaja sallii Sinulle Lisensoitujen Oikeuksien käytön kaikilla jo tunnetuilla ja myöhemmin kehitettävillä välineillä ja kaikissa jo tunnetuissa ja myöhemmin kehitettävissä muodoissa sekä tarvittavien teknisten muutosten tekemisen tämän toteuttamiseksi. Lisenssinantaja luopuu ja/tai suostuu pidättäytymään käyttämästä oikeuttaan tai määräysvaltaansa estääkseen Sinua tekemästä sellaisia teknisiä muutoksia, jotka ovat tarpeen Lisensoitujen Oikeuksien käyttämiseksi, mukaan lukien sellaisia teknisiä muutoksia, jotka ovat tarpeen Tehokkaiden Teknisten Toimenpiteiden kiertämiseksi. Tätä Julkista Lisenssiä käytettäessä ja tulkittaessa katsotaan, ettei pelkkä tämän kohdan 2(a)(4) nojalla sallittujen muutosten tekeminen koskaan merkitse Muunnellun Aineiston syntymistä.
Myöhemmät käyttäjät.
Lisenssinantajan tarjous – Lisensoitu Aineisto. Kaikki, jotka vastaanottavat Lisensoitua Aineistoa, saavat Lisenssinantajalta automaattisesti tarjouksen käyttää Lisensoituja Oikeuksia tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehtojen mukaisesti.
Ei myöhempiä käyttäjiä koskevia rajoituksia. Sinä et saa tarjota etkä asettaa mitään sellaisia Lisensoitua Aineistoa koskevia ylimääräisiä tai poikkeavia ehtoja, etkä kohdistaa Lisensoituun Aineistoon mitään sellaisia Tehokkaita Teknisiä Toimenpiteitä, jotka estävät Lisensoidun Aineiston vastaanottajaa käyttämästä Lisensoituja Oikeuksia.
Ei ilmaise hyväksyntää. Mikään seikka tässä Julkisessa Lisenssissä ei anna, eikä minkään seikan tässä Julkisessa Lisenssissä voida tulkita antavan, lupaa väittää tai antaa ymmärtää, että Sinulla tai Sinun Lisensoidun Aineiston käytölläsi olisi liityntä Lisenssinantajaan tai muuhun kohdan 3(a)(1)(A)(i) mukaisesti nimettävään tahoon tai että Lisenssinantaja tai muu yllä mainittu taho olisi sponsoroinut Sinun toimintaasi tai tukenut tai myöntänyt Sinun toiminnallesi muodollisen aseman.
Muut oikeudet.
Tällä Julkisella Lisenssillä ei lisensoida moraalisia oikeuksia kuten respektioikeutta, eikä myöskään henkilön oikeutta määrätä nimensä, kuvansa tai henkilönsä muun tunnistettavan osan kaupallisesta käytöstä (right of publicity), yksityisyyden suojaa koskevia oikeuksia ja/tai muita sellaisia persoonallisuusoikeuksia; kuitenkin siinä laajuudessa kuin on mahdollista ja tarpeen Sinun Lisensoitujen Oikeuksien käytöllesi, muttei muilta osin, Lisenssinantaja luopuu tällaisista oikeuksistaan ja/tai sitoutuu siihen, että ei esitä tällaisiin oikeuksiin perustuvia väitteitä.
Tällä Julkisella Lisenssillä ei lisensoida patentti- ja tavaramerkkioikeuksia.
Siinä laajuudessa kuin on mahdollista, Lisenssinantaja luopuu oikeudestaan kerätä Sinulta rojalteja Lisensoitujen Oikeuksien käytöstä, tapahtuipa tämä suoraan tai oikeuksia hallinnoivan järjestön kautta tai minkä tahansa vapaaehtoisen, lakisääteisen tai pakollisen lisensointijärjestelmän nojalla taikka sellaisen lisensointijärjestelmän nojalla, josta voidaan luopua. Kaikissa muissa tapauksissa Lisenssinantaja nimenomaisesti pidättää itsellään oikeuden kerätä sellaisia rojalteja.
Osa 3 – Lisenssin ehdot.
Sinun Lisensoitujen Oikeuksien käyttöösi sovelletaan nimenomaisesti seuraavia ehtoja.
Nimeä.
Jos Sinä Jaat Lisensoitua Aineistoa (mukaan lukien muokatussa muodossa), Sinun tulee:
säilyttää seuraavat tiedot, mikäli Lisenssinantaja on antanut ne Lisensoidun Aineiston mukana:
Lisensoidun Aineiston tekijä(t) ja muut nimettäväksi määritellyt tahot identifioiva maininta jollakin Lisenssinantajan edellyttämällä kohtuullisella tavalla (mukaan lukien salanimi, jos sellaista on käytetty);
tekijänoikeusmerkintä;
merkintä, joka viittaa tähän Julkiseen Lisenssiin;
merkintä, joka viittaa takuun rajoituslausekkeeseen;
Lisensoituun Aineistoon viittaava URI tai hyperlinkki, mikäli tämä on kohtuullisesti toteutettavissa;
merkitä, jos Sinä olet muokannut Lisensoitua Aineistoa, ja säilyttää aiempia muokkauksia koskevat merkinnät; sekä
merkitä, että Lisensoitu Aineisto on lisensoitu tällä Julkisella Lisenssillä, ja sisällyttää tämän Julkisen Lisenssin teksti taikka tähän Julkiseen Lisenssiin viittaava URI tai hyperlinkki.
Sinä voit täyttää kohdan 3(a)(1) mukaiset edellytykset millä tahansa kohtuullisella tavalla riippuen välineestä, keinoista ja yhteydestä, jossa Sinä Jaat Lisensoitua Aineistoa. Voi esimerkiksi olla kohtuullista täyttää vaatimukset tarjoamalla URI tai hyperlinkki resurssiin, josta vaaditut tiedot ilmenevät.
Lisenssinantajan näin vaatiessa Sinun tulee poistaa mitkä tahansa kohdan 3(a)(1)(A) nojalla vaaditut tiedot siinä laajuudessa kuin tämä on kohtuullisesti toteutettavissa.
Jos Sinä Jaat Sinun tuottamaasi Muunneltua Aineistoa, Sinun käyttämäsi Muuntelijan Lisenssi ei saa estää Muunnellun Aineiston vastaanottajia noudattamasta tätä Julkista Lisenssiä.
Osa 4 – Sui Generis Tietokantaoikeudet.
Sikäli kuin Lisensoidut Oikeudet sisältävät Sui Generis Tietokantaoikeuksia, jotka koskevat Sinun Lisensoidun Aineiston käyttöäsi:
selvyyden vuoksi todettakoon, että kohta 2(a)(1) antaa Sinulle oikeuden kopioida, käyttää uudelleen, toisintaa ja Jakaa koko tietokannan sisältöä tai sen olennaista osaa;
jos Sinä sisällytät kaiken tai olennaisen osan tietokannan sisällöstä tietokantaan, johon Sinulla on Sui Generis Tietokantaoikeuksia, se tietokanta, johon Sinulla on Sui Generis Tietokantaoikeuksia (mutteivät tämän tietokannan yksittäiset sisällöt), katsotaan Muunnelluksi Aineistoksi; ja
Sinun täytyy noudattaa kohdan 3(a) ehtoja, jos Sinä Jaat koko tietokannan sisältöä tai sen olennaista osaa.
Selvyyden vuoksi todettakoon, että tämä osa 4 täydentää eikä syrjäytä Sinun tästä Julkisesta Lisenssistä johtuvia velvollisuuksiasi tilanteissa, joissa Lisensoidut Oikeudet käsittävät muita Tekijänoikeuksia ja Samankaltaisia Oikeuksia.
Osa 5 – Takuun rajoitus ja vastuunrajoituslauseke.
Siinä laajuudessa kuin on mahdollista ja ellei Lisenssinantaja muuhun erikseen sitoudu, Lisenssinantaja tarjoaa Lisensoidun Aineiston sellaisena kuin se on ja sellaisena kuin se on saatavilla ilman minkäänlaista nimenomaista, oletettua, lainmukaista tai muunkaltaista takuuta tai takuuehtoa Lisensoituun Aineistoon liittyen. Tämä käsittää esimerkiksi vakuutukset, jotka koskevat omistusoikeutta, myyntikelpoisuutta, tiettyyn tarkoitukseen sopivuutta, oikeuksien loukkaamattomuutta, virheettömyyttä (piilevät tai muut viat), tarkkuutta taikka todettavissa olevia tai todettavissa olemattomia virheitä. Siltä osin kuin takuun rajoitukset eivät ole joltain osin tai lainkaan sallittuja, tämä takuun rajoitus ei koske Sinua.
Siinä laajuudessa kuin on mahdollista, Lisenssinantaja ei ole missään tapauksessa Sinuun nähden vastuussa Sinulle millään oikeudellisella perusteella (mukaan lukien tuottamuksella) eikä muutoinkaan mistään välittömistä, erityisistä, epäsuorista, sattumanvaraisista tai välillisistä vahingoista johtuvan tai rangaistusluonteisen vahingonkorvausvastuun perusteella syntyvistä vahingoista taikka muista menetyksistä, kuluista, kustannuksista tai vahingoista, jotka johtuvat tästä Julkisesta Lisenssistä tai Lisensoidun Aineiston käytöstä, vaikka Lisenssinantajaa olisi varoitettu tällaisten menetysten, kulujen, kustannusten tai vahinkojen vaarasta. Siltä osin kuin vastuunrajoitus ei ole joltain osin tai lainkaan sallittu, tämä vastuunrajoituslauseke ei koske Sinua.
Yllä olevaa takuun rajoitusta ja vastuunrajoituslauseketta tulkitaan tavalla, joka, siinä laajuudessa kuin on mahdollista, läheisimmin vastaa täydellistä takuun rajoitusta ja vastuuvapautta.
Osa 6 – Voimassaoloaika ja päättyminen.
Tämä Julkinen Lisenssi on voimassa sillä lisensoidun Tekijänoikeuden ja Samankaltaisten Oikeuksien voimassaoloajan. Jos Sinä et kuitenkaan noudata tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehtoja, Sinun tähän Julkiseen Lisenssiin perustuvat oikeutesi päättyvät automaattisesti.
Sikäli kuin Sinun oikeutesi käyttää Lisensoitua Aineistoa on päättynyt kohdan 6(a) nojalla, se palautuu:
automaattisesti siitä päivästä lähtien, kun loukkaus päättyy, jos loukkaus päättyy 30 päivän kuluessa siitä, kun Sinä sait loukkauksesta tiedon; tai
kun Lisenssinantaja nimenomaisesti palauttaa oikeutesi.
Selvyyden vuoksi todettakoon, ettei tämä kohta 6(b) vaikuta mihinkään sellaisiin oikeussuojakeinoihin, jotka ovat Lisenssinantajan käytettävissä perustuen tämän Julkisen Lisenssin loukkaamiseen Sinun toimestasi.
Selvyyden vuoksi todettakoon, että Lisenssinantaja voi myös tarjota Lisensoitua Aineistoa muilla ehdoilla tai lopettaa Lisensoidun Aineiston levittämisen koska tahansa; tämä ei kuitenkaan lakkauta tätä Julkista Lisenssiä.
Osat 1, 5, 6, 7 ja 8 pysyvät voimassa, vaikka tämä Julkinen Lisenssi lakkaisi.
Osa 7 – Muut ehdot.
Lisenssinantaja ei ole sidottu mihinkään Sinun ilmoittamiisi täydentäviin tai poikkeaviin ehtoihin, ellei tästä ole nimenomaisesti sovittu.
Kaikki Lisensoitua Aineistoa koskevat muut järjestelyt, yhteisymmärrykset tai sopimukset, joita ei tässä Julkisessa Lisenssissä mainita, ovat erillisiä ja itsenäisiä suhteessa tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehtoihin.
Osa 8 – Tulkinta.
Selvyyden vuoksi todettakoon, että tätä Julkista Lisenssiä ei tulkita eikä tule tulkita siten, että se vähentäisi, rajoittaisi, estäisi tai asettaisi ehtoja sellaiselle Lisensoidun Aineiston käytölle, joka olisi lain mukaan sallittua ilman tämän Julkisen Lisenssin mukaista lupaa.
Siinä laajuudessa kuin on mahdollista, jos jokin tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehdoista katsottaisiin täytäntöönpanokelvottomaksi, sitä muutetaan automaattisesti vähäisimmin täytäntöönpanokelpoisuuden edellyttämin muutoksin. Jos ehtoa ei voida muuttaa, se erotetaan tästä Julkisesta Lisenssistä siten, ettei se vaikuta jäljellä olevien ehtojen täytäntöönpanokelpoisuuteen.
Mistään tämän Julkisen Lisenssin ehdosta ei luovuta, eikä mitään lisenssinvastaista käyttöä hyväksytä, ellei Lisenssinantaja tähän nimenomaisesti suostu.
Mikään tässä Julkisessa Lisenssissä ei ole, eikä sen voida tulkita olevan, rajoitus tai luopuminen mistään Lisenssinantajalle tai Sinulle kuuluvasta etuoikeudesta tai oikeudellisesta suojasta, mukaan lukien etuoikeuksista tai oikeudellisesta suojasta menettelyissä, jotka tapahtuvat minkä tahansa oikeudenkäyttöalueen piirissä tai suhteessa mihin tahansa viranomaiseen.
Creative Commons ei ole julkisten lisenssiensä osapuoli. Siitä huolimatta Creative Commons voi päättää asettaa julkaisemaansa aineistoa saataville jollakin julkisista lisensseistään, jolloin tällaisissa tapauksissa sen katsotaan olevan “Lisenssinantaja”. Creative Commonsin julkisten lisenssien teksti on asetettu vapaaseen yleiseen käyttöön (public domain) CC0 Public Domain -lausuman mukaisesti. Creative Commons ei salli ilman etukäteistä kirjallista suostumusta tavaramerkkinsä “Creative Commons” tai minkään muunkaan tavaramerkin taikka Creative Commons -logon käyttöä, mukaan lukien tapauksissa, joissa Creative Commonsin julkisia lisenssejä on luvatta muunneltu, tai liittyen mihin tahansa muihin järjestelyihin, yhteisymmärryksiin tai sopimuksiin, jotka koskevat lisensoidun materiaalin käyttöä. Edellisessä virkkeessä sanottu ei kuitenkaan koske niitä rajoitettuja tapauksia, joissa tarkoitus on ilmaista materiaalin olevan lisensoitu Creative Commonsin julkisella lisenssillä tai joissa käyttö on muutoin Creative Commonsin osoitteessa creativecommons.org/policies julkaisemien käytännesääntöjen sallimaa. Selvyyden vuoksi todettakoon, että tämä kappale ei ole osa Creative Commonsin julkisia lisenssejä.

memperbanyak dan Membagikan Materi Berlisensi, dalam bentuk utuh maupun sebagian; dan
menciptakan, memperbanyak, dan Membagikan Materi Adaptasi.

Media dan format; modifikasi teknis diperbolehkan. Pemberi Lisensi mengizinkan Anda untuk menggunakan Hak Lisensi pada seluruh media dan format baik yang telah diketahui saat ini maupun yang akan diciptakan, dan untuk melakukan modifikasi teknis yang diperlukan. Pemberi Lisensi melepaskan dan/atau setuju untuk tidak menggunakan hak atau kewenangan apapun untuk melarang Anda melakukan modifikasi teknis yang diperlukan untuk menggunakan Hak Lisensi, termasuk modifikasi teknis yang diperlukan untuk menghilangkan Sarana Kontrol Teknologi. Untuk tujuan Lisensi Publik ini, pembuatan modifikasi yang diizinkan Bagian 2(a)(4) ini tidak berarti menghasilkan Materi Adaptasi.

Tidak ada halangan tambahan. Anda tidak boleh menawarkan atau memberikan syarat dan ketentuan tambahan pada, atau menggunakan Sarana Kontrol Teknologi pada, Materi Berlisensi apabila tindakan tersebut menghalangi penggunaan Hak Lisensi oleh setiap pengguna lain dari Materi Berlinsensi.

Hak moral, seperti hak atas integritas, tidak dilisensikan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini, juga hak atas potret, kerahasiaan, dan/atau hak personal serupa lainnya; walau demikian, sejauh yang dimungkinkan, Pemberi Lisensi melepaskan dan/atau setuju untuk tidak menggunakan hak lainnya yang dipegang oleh Pemberi Lisensi hingga batasan tertentu untuk mengizinkan Anda menggunakan Hak Lisensi, dan bukan sebaliknya.
Hak paten dan merek dagang tidak dilisensikan di bawah Lisensi Publik.
Sejauh yang dimungkinkan, Pemberi Lisensi melepaskan hak untuk mendapatkan royalti dari Anda dengan menggunakan Hak Lisensi, baik secara langsung maupun melalui lembaga manajemen kolektif di bawah ketentuan skema lisensi sukarela atau yang dapat dilepaskan maupun skema lisensi wajib.

Bagian 3 – Ketentuan Lisensi.
Penggunaan Anda atas Hak Lisensi bergantung pada ketentuan di bawah ini.
Atribusi.
Apabila Anda Membagikan Materi Berlisensi (termasuk yang telah dimodifikasi), Anda wajib:
mencantumkan hal-hal di bawah ini apabila dinyatakan oleh Pemberi Lisensi di dalam Materi Berlisensi:
identitas para pencipta Materi Berlisensi dan pihak lain yang harus menerima atribusi, dengan cara yang sesuai dengan permintaan Pemberi Lisensi (termasuk penggunaan nama samaran jika ada);
pemberitahuan hak cipta;
pemberitahuan mengenai Lisensi Publik ini;
pemberitahuan mengenai pernyataan jaminan;
PSS (pengidentifikasi sumber seragam) atau tautan kepada Materi Berlisensi jika memungkinkan;
menunjukkan bahwa Anda telah memodifikasi Materi Berlisensi dan menunjukkan setiap modifikasi yang sebelumnya pernah dibuat; dan
menunjukkan bahwa Materi Berlisensi dilisensikan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini, termasuk teks, atau PSS dan tautan kepada, dari Lisensi Publik ini.
Anda dapat melaksanakan ketentuan pada Bagian 3(a)(1) dengan cara yang sesuai dengan perantara, cara, dan konteks penggunaan Anda dalam Membagikan Materi Berlisensi. Sebagai contoh, Anda dapat melaksanakan ketentuan ini dengan memberikan PSS atau tautan kepada sumber yang menyediakan informasi yang dibutuhkan.
Apabila dimintakan demikian oleh Pemberi Lisensi, Anda harus menghilangkan setiap informasi yang dinyatakan dalam Bagian 3(a)(1)(A) jika memungkinkan.
Apabila Anda Membagikan Materi Adaptasi yang Anda buat, Lisensi Pengadaptasi yang harus Anda gunakan tidak dapat menghalangi penerima Materi Adaptasi untuk melaksanakan Lisensi Publik ini.
Bagian 4 – Hak Basis Data Sui Generis.
Apabila Hak Lisensi mencakup Hak Basis Data Sui Generis yang berlaku untuk penggunaan Anda atas Materi Berlisensi:
untuk menghindari keraguan, Bagian 2(a)(1) memberikan hak kepada Anda untuk mengambil, menggunakan kembali, memperbanyak, dan Membagikan seluruh atau sebagian besar dari isi basis data;
apabila Anda mencantumkan seluruh atau sebagian besar dari isi basis data di dalam basis data dengan Hak Basis Data Sui Generis yang dapat Anda gunakan, maka basis data dengan Hak Basis Data Sui Generis yang dapat Anda gunakan (namun bukan isinya secara terpisah) adalah Materi Adaptasi; dan
Anda harus melaksanakan ketentuan dalam Bagian 3(a) apabila Anda Membagikan seluruh atau sebagian besar dari isi basis data.
Untuk menghindari keraguan, Bagian 4 ini menambahkan dan tidak menggantikan kewajiban Anda di bawah Lisensi Publik di mana Hak Lisensi termasuk Hak Cipta dan Hak-hak Serupa lainnya.
Bagian 5 – Pernyataan Jaminan dan Batasan Tanggung Jawab.
Kecuali dilaksanakan dengan cara lain secara terpisah oleh Pemberi Lisensi, sejauh yang dimungkinkan, Pemberi Lisensi memberikan Materi Berlisensi “apa adanya” dan “sebagaimana tersedia”, dan tidak memberikan pernyataan atau jaminan apapun terkait Materi Berlisensi, baik secara tegas, secara tersirat, berdasarkan hukum, atau lainnya. Hal ini termasuk, tanpa terbatas pada, jaminan atas hak, jual beli, kecocokan untuk tujuan tertentu, tidak adanya pelanggaran, tidak adanya pengelabuan atau cacat lainnya, keakuratan, atau adanya atau tidak adanya kesalahan, baik yang diketahui maupun tidak. Dalam hal pernyataan jaminan tidak dapat dilaksanakan secara penuh atau sebagian, pernyataan ini tidak berlaku terhadap Anda.
Sejauh yang dimungkinkan, Pemberi Lisensi tidak dapat dianggap bertanggung jawab kepada Anda untuk tindakan hukum apapun (termasuk, tanpa terbatas pada, kelalaian) atau untuk setiap kehilangan, kerugian, pengeluaran, atau kerusakan yang terjadi secara langsung, khusus, tidak langsung, sebagai kecelakaan, akibat, hukuman, pembebasan, atau lainnya yang muncul dari Lisensi Publik ini atau penggunaan Materi Berlisensi, walau pemberi lisensi telah memberitahukan kemungkinan terjadinya kehilangan, kerugian, pengeluaran, atau kerusakan tersebut. Dalam hal pembatasan tanggung jawab tidak dapat dilaksanakan secara penuh atau sebagian, batasan ini tidak berlaku terhadap Anda.
Pernyataan jaminan dan batasan tanggung jawab di atas ini dapat diinterpretasikan dengan cara, sejauh yang dimungkinkan, yang paling dekat dengan pernyataan dan pelepasan dari seluruh tanggung jawab sepenuhnya.
Bagian 6 – Jangka Waktu dan Penghentian.
Lisensi Publik ini berlaku sepanjang jangka waktu Hak Cipta dan Hak-hak Serupa yang dilisensikan di bawahnya. Walau demikian, apabila Anda lalai dalam melaksanakan ketentuan Lisensi Publik ini, maka hak Anda di bawah Lisensi Publik ini akan secara otomatis berakhir.
Dalam hal hak Anda untuk menggunakan Materi Berlisensi telah berakhir sesuai Bagian 6(a), Lisensi Publik ini dapat berlaku kembali:
secara otomatis pada tanggal ditanggulanginya kelalaian yang dilakukan, atau dalam waktu 30 hari setelah Anda mengetahui kelalaian yang dilakukan; atau
berdasarkan pemberlakukan kembali oleh Pemberi Lisensi.
Untuk menghindari keraguan, Bagian 6(b) tidak berpengaruh pada setiap pelanggaran atas hak yang dimiliki oleh Pemberi Lisensi yang terjadi akibat kelalaian Anda melaksanakan ketentuan dalam Lisensi Publik ini.
Untuk menghindari keraguan, Pemberi Lisensi dapat menawarkan Materi Berlisensi di bawah syarat dan ketentuan yang terpisah atau berhenti menyebarluaskan Materi Berlisensi di setiap waktu; namun, hal ini tidak akan menghentikan keberlakuan Lisensi Publik ini.
Bagian 1, 5, 6, 7, dan 8 akan terus berlaku setelah Lisensi Publik ini berakhir.
Bagian 7 – Syarat dan Ketentuan Lain.
Pemberi Lisensi tidak terikat di bawah setiap syarat atau ketentuan tambahan atau syarat atau ketentuan yang berbeda yang Anda sarankan kecuali secara tegas disetujui demikian.
Setiap aturan, kesepakatan, atau perjanjian terkait Materi Berlisensi yang tidak tercantum di sini berlaku secara terpisah dan tidak bergantung pada syarat dan ketentuan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini.
Bagian 8 – Interpretasi.
Untuk menghindari keraguan, Lisensi Publik ini tidak bertujuan untuk, dan tidak dapat dianggap bertujuan untuk, mengurangi, membatasi, menghalangi, atau memaksakan ketentuan dari setiap penggunaan Materi Berlisensi yang secara hukum dapat diciptakan tanpa izin di bawah Lisensi Publik ini.
Sejauh yang dimungkinkan, apabila ketentuan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini dinilai tidak dapat dilaksanakan, maka kewajiban pelaksanaan ketentuan harus dilakukan dengan cara yang sesuai. Apabila ketentuan yang ada tidak dapat dilaksanakan sama sekali, maka ketentuan tersebut ditiadakan dari Lisensi Publik ini namun tidak berpengaruh pada pelaksanaan syarat dan ketentuan lainnya.
Syarat atau ketentuan di bawah Lisensi Publik ini tidak dapat dilepaskan dan tidak ada kelalaian yang diizinkan kecuali secara tegas disetujui demikian oleh Pemberi Lisensi.
Lisensi Publik ini tidak memunculkan atau dapat dianggap sebagai pembatasan dari, atau pelepasan atas, setiap hak dan kekebalan yang berlaku untuk Pemberi Lisensi atau Anda, termasuk dari proses hukum menurut jurisdiksi atau kewenangan apapun.
Creative Commons bukanlah pihak dalam lisensi publik. Walau demikian, Creative Commons dapat memilih untuk menggunakan salah satu dari lisensi publik yang ada untuk materi yang dipublikasikan oleh kami dan dalam hal demikian dianggap sebagai "Pemberi Lisensi." Teks dari lisensi publik Creative Commons disebarluaskan di bawah Dedikasi Domain Publik CC0.

Når det gjelder denne offentlige lisensen, så vil det å gjøre endringer med hjemmel i dette avsnitt 2(a)(4) aldri produsere Bearbeidet Materiale.
Nedstrøms-mottakere.
Tilbud fra Lisensgiveren – Lisensiert Materiale. Enhver mottaker av det Lisensierte Materialet mottar automatisk et tilbud fra Lisensgiveren om å utøve de Lisensierte Rettighetene under de vilkår og betingelser som fremgår av denne Offentlige Lisensen.
Ingen nedstrøms-restriksjoner. Du kan ikke tilby eller pålegge ytterligere eller andre vilkår og betingelser, eller benytte noen Effektive Teknologiske Tiltak, på det Lisensierte Materialet dersom dette begrenser utøvelsen av de Lisensierte Rettigheter for en mottaker av det Lisensierte Materialet.
Ingen anbefaling. Ingenting i denne Offentlige Lisensen utgjør, eller kan tolkes som tillatelse til å hevde eller påstå at Du er, eller at Din bruk av det Lisensierte Materialet er, forbundet med, eller støttet av, eller anbefalt av, eller gitt en offisiell status av Lisensgiveren eller som er utpekt til å motta navngivelse slik som angitt i avsnitt 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Andre rettigheter.
Ideelle rettigheter, så som respektretten, blir ikke lisensiert under denne Offentlige Lisensen, og heller ikke blir reklame-, privatliv- og/eller andre lignende personvernrettigheter lisensiert; imidlertid, i den grad det er mulig, fraskriver Lisensgiver og/eller samtykker Lisensgiver i ikke å hevde slike rettigheter som tilhører Lisensgiver i den avgrensede grad dette er nødvendig for å la Deg utnytte de Lisensierte Rettighetene, men ikke på andre måter.
Patent- og varemerkerettigheter lisensieres ikke under denne Offentlige Lisensen.
I den utstrekning det er mulig fraskriver Lisensgiver seg retten til å motta vederlag for bruk («royalties») fra Deg for utøvelse av de Lisensierte Rettighetene, enten direkte eller via en vederlagsorganisasjon under frivillige eller fravikbare lovbestemte eller obligatoriske lisensordninger. I alle andre tilfeller forbeholder Lisensgiveren seg uttrykkelig retten til å motta slike vederlag.
Del 3 – Lisensbetingelser.

beholde det påfølgende dersom det er stilt til rådighet av Lisensgiver sammen med det Lisensierte Materialet:
identifikasjon av den/de som har skapt det Lisensierte Materialet og enhver annen som er utpekt til å motta navngivelse, på enhver rimelig måte som Lisensgiver har anmodet om, (inklusive ved pseudonym dersom et slikt er angitt);

Du kan tilfredsstille vilkårene i avsnitt 3(a)(1) på enhver rimelig måte basert på det medium, middel, og den kontekst der Du Deler det Lisensierte Materialet. For eksempel kan det være rimelig å oppfylle vilkårene ved å tilby en URI eller hyperlenke til en ressurs som inneholder de nødvendige opplysningene.
Dersom Lisensgiveren anmoder om det, må Du fjerne enhver av de opplysningene som kreves ifølge avsnitt 3(a)(1)(A) i den grad dette er praktisk mulig.
Dersom du Deler Bearbeidet materiale som du produserer må den Bearbeiderens Lisens som Du anvender ikke forhindre mottakeren av det Bearbeidede Materialet fra å etterleve denne Offentlige Lisensen.
Del 4 – Sui Generis Databaserettigheter.
Der de Lisensierte Rettighetene omfatter Sui Generis Databaserettigheter som gjelder for Din bruk av det Lisensierte Materialet:
for å unngå tvil, avsnitt 2(a)(1) gir Deg rett til å trekke ut, gjenbruke, reprodusere, og Dele hele eller vesentlige deler av innholdet i databasen;
dersom Du inkluderer hele eller vesentlige deler av innholdet i en database i en database der Du har Sui Generis Databaserettigheter, så er databasen der Du har Sui Generis Databaserettigheter (men ikke dens individuelle innhold) å anse som Bearbeidet Materiale; og
Du må overholde vilkårene i avsnitt 3(a) dersom Du Deler hele eller vesentlige deler av innholdet i databasen.
For å unngå tvil, denne del 4 supplerer og erstatter ikke Dine forpliktelser i henhold til denne Offentlige Lisensen der hvor de Lisensierte Rettighetene omfatter andre Opphavsrettigheter og Lignende Rettigheter.
Del 5 – Garantifraskrivelse og ansvarsbegrensing.
Med mindre Lisensgiveren har meddelt deg noe annet gjennom en separat handling, tilbyr Lisensgiveren, i den utstrekning det er mulig, det Lisensierte Materialet som det er og som det er tilgjengelig, og gir ingen garantier av noe slag om det Lisensierte Materialet, verken direkte, indirekte, som følge av lov, eller på annen måte. Dette inkluderer, uten begrensning, garantier om eiendomsrett, salgbarhet, egnethet for et bestemt formål, manglende krenkelse, fravær av latente eller andre defekter, nøyaktighet, eller tilstedeværelse eller fravær av feil, enten slike er ukjente eller oppdagbare. Der hvor garantifraskrivelser ikke er tillatt helt eller delvis kan det være at denne fraskrivelsen ikke gjelder for Deg.
I den grad det er mulig vil Lisensgiveren ikke under noen omstendighet være ansvarlig ovenfor Deg på noe rettslig grunnlag (inkludert, uten begrensning, uaktsomhet) eller på annen måte for noe direkte, spesielt, indirekte, utilsiktet, tilsiktet, straffbart, ikke-økonomisk eller annet tap, kostnad, utgift eller skade som oppstår som følge av denne Offentlige Lisensen eller bruk av det Lisensierte Materialet, selv om Lisensgiveren har blitt informert om muligheten for at det kan oppstå slike tap, kostnader, utgifter eller skader. Der hvor ansvarsbegrensninger ikke er tillatt helt eller delvis kan det være at denne begrensningen ikke gjelder for Deg.
De garantifraskrivelser og ansvarsbegrensninger som er nevnt ovenfor, skal tolkes på en måte som, i den grad det er mulig, mest mulig tilsvarer en absolutt fraskrivelse av alt ansvar.
Del 6 – Varighet og Opphør.
Denne Offentlige Lisensen varer så lenge Opphavsrett og Lignende Rettigheter som blir lisensiert her gjelder. Imidlertid, dersom Du ikke overholder denne Offentlige Lisensen vil de rettigheter Du er gitt under denne Offentlige Lisens automatisk opphøre.
Dersom Din rett til å bruke det Lisensierte Materialet har opphørt under avsnitt 6(a), vil den gjeninnsettes:
automatisk fra den dato overtredelsen er reparert, forutsatt at den er reparert innen 30 dager etter Du er blitt gjort kjent med overtredelsen; eller
ved uttrykkelig gjeninnsettelse fra Lisensgiveren.
For å unngå tvil, dette avsnittet 6(b) påvirker ikke den rett Lisensgivers kan ha til kompensasjon for Din overtredelse av denne Offentlige Lisensen.
For å unngå tvil, Lisensgiveren kan også tilby det Lisensierte Materialet under separate vilkår eller betingelser eller stoppe distribusjonen av det Lisensierte Materialet på ethvert tidspunkt; imidlertid vil dette ikke bringe denne Offentlige Lisensen til opphør.
Avsnittene 1, 5, 6, 7, og 8 overlever opphør av denne Offentlige Lisensen.
Del 7 – Andre Vilkår og Betingelser.
Lisensgiveren skal ikke være bundet av andre eller avvikende vilkår eller betingelser Du har meddelt med mindre dette er uttrykkelig avtalt.
Enhver ordning, forståelse, eller avtale omkring det Lisensierte Materialet som ikke er nevnt her er adskilt fra og uavhengig av de vilkår og betingelser som utgjør denne Offentlige Lisensen.
Del 8 – Tolkning.
For å unngå tvil, denne Offentlige Lisensen begrenser ikke, og skal ikke bli tolket slik at den reduserer, begrenser eller setter vilkår for, bruken av det Lisensierte Materialet dersom bruken er lovlig uten at det er gitt tillatelse under denne Offentlige Lisensen.
I den utstrekning det er mulig, dersom en bestemmelse i denne Offentlige Lisensen ansees for å være ugyldig eller ikke gjennomførbar, skal den automatisk endres, dog i så liten utstrekning som mulig, slik at den blir gyldig og gjennomførbar. Dersom bestemmelsen ikke kan endres, skal den tas ut av den Offentlige Lisensen uten å påvirke gyldigheten eller gjennomførbarheten av de gjenstående vilkår og betingelser.
Intet vilkår eller betingelse angitt i denne Offentlige Lisensen vil bli frafalt og intet brudd på vilkårene vil bli bifalt, med mindre det foreligger uttrykkelig samtykke fra Lisensgiveren.
Ingenting i denne Offentlig Lisensen utgjør eller kan tolkes som en begrensning, eller fraskrivelse, av noe privilegium eller særrettighet som gjelder for Lisensgiveren eller for Deg, inklusive fra de rettslige prosesser i noen jurisdiksjon eller myndighet.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

Déclaration d'Intention
Les lois de la plupart des juridictions à travers le monde accordent automatiquement des Droits d'Auteur et Droits Voisins exclusifs (définis ci-dessous) au créateur et au(x) titulaire(s) de droits successif(s) (ci-après, le « titulaire ») d'une œuvre originale et/ou d'une base de données (ci-après, une « Œuvre» ).
Certains titulaires souhaitent renoncer de façon définitive à ces droits sur une Œuvre dans le but de contribuer à un fonds commun d'œuvres créatives, culturelles et scientifiques (les « Communs ») que le public a la possibilité d'élaborer, de modifier, et d'incorporer dans d'autres œuvres de façon fiable et sans crainte de recours ultérieurs pour contrefaçon, de réutiliser et de redistribuer aussi librement que possible sous n'importe quelle forme et pour n'importe quelle finalité, y compris, et sans réserves, à des fins commerciales. Ces titulaires contribuent aux Communs pour promouvoir les idéaux d'une culture libre et accroître la production d'œuvres créatives, culturelles et scientifiques, ou pour acquérir une réputation ou une plus grande diffusion de leur Œuvre, notamment grâce à l'utilisation et aux efforts des autres.
C'est pour ces finalités et motivations, ainsi que pour d'autres, et sans attendre aucune rémunération, avantage ou compensation supplémentaire, que la personne associant CC0 à une Œuvre (le « Déclarant »), dans la mesure où elle est titulaire des Droits d'Auteur et des Droits Voisins sur l'Œuvre, décide volontairement d'appliquer CC0 à l'Œuvre et de distribuer publiquement l'Œuvre sous ses conditions, en toute connaissance de ses Droits d'Auteur et Droits Voisins sur l'Œuvre, ainsi que de la portée et des effets juridiques de CC0 sur ces droits.
1. Droit d'Auteur et Droits Voisins. Il est possible qu'une Œuvre mise à disposition sous CC0 soit protégée par des droits d'auteur et des droits voisins (« Droit d'Auteur et Droits Voisins »). Le Droit d'Auteur et les Droits Voisins comportent, sans s'y limiter, les droits suivants :
Le droit de reproduire, adapter, distribuer, interpréter, représenter, communiquer et traduire une Œuvre ;
Les droits moraux détenus par le ou les auteur(s) originel(s) et/ou le ou les interprète(s) ;
Les droits à la vie privée et à l'image des personnes représentées dans une Œuvre ;
Le droit de la concurrence déloyale à l'égard d'une Œuvre, soumis aux limitations prévues dans le paragraphe 4(a) ci-dessous ;
Les droits protégeant l'extraction, la diffusion, l'utilisation et la réutilisation des données contenues dans une Œuvre ;
Les droits relatifs aux bases de données (tels qu'ils découlent de la Directive 96/9/CE du Parlement Européen et du Conseil du 11 mars 1996 concernant la protection juridique des bases de données, ainsi que de toute transposition au niveau national, y compris de toute version amendée ou ultérieure de cette directive) ; et
Tous autres droits similaires, équivalents ou correspondants à travers le monde, fondés sur toute loi ou traité en vigueur, et toute transposition nationale de ceux-ci.
2. Renonciation. Dans la mesure du possible et sans enfreindre la loi en vigueur, le Déclarant affirme par la présente céder, abandonner, et renoncer ouvertement, pleinement, définitivement, irrévocablement et sans conditions à tous ses Droits d'Auteur et Droits Voisins, ainsi qu'à toute prétention, recours et possibilités d'action judiciaire, qu'ils soient à cet instant connus ou inconnus (y compris les prétentions, recours et possibilités d'action judiciaire qui seraient associés ou à naître), sur l'Œuvre, (i) partout dans le monde, (ii) pour la durée maximale prévue par les lois ou traités en vigueur (y compris les prolongations futures de cette durée), (iii) sur n'importe quel support existant ou futur et quel que soit le nombre de copies, et (iv) pour toute finalité quelle qu’elle soit, y compris, et sans réserve, les finalités commerciales, publicitaires ou promotionnelles (la « Renonciation »). La Renonciation est faite au bénéfice de chaque membre du public et au détriment des héritiers et successeurs du Déclarant, avec la ferme intention que cette Renonciation ne soit pas soumise à révocation, annulation, résiliation, interruption, ou de tout autre recours juridique ou judiciaire susceptible de perturber la jouissance paisible de l'Œuvre par le public telle que prévue par la Déclaration d'Intention du Déclarant.
3. Licence Publique Supplétive. Au cas où une partie quelconque de la Renonciation serait jugée juridiquement nulle ou sans effet pour quelque raison que ce soit en vertu de la loi en vigueur, la Renonciation devra être préservée dans la mesure maximum permise, de manière à permettre la prise en compte la plus large de la Déclaration d'Intention du Déclarant. De plus, dans la mesure où la Renonciation serait jugée ainsi, le Déclarant accorde par la présente à chaque personne concernée une licence gratuite, non transférable, non sous-licenciable, non exclusive, irrévocable et inconditionnelle d’exercer les Droits d'Auteur et Droits Voisins sur l'Œuvre (i) partout dans le monde, (ii) pour la durée maximale prévue par les lois ou traités en vigueur (y compris les prolongations futures de cette durée), (iii) sur n'importe quel support existant ou futur et quel que soit le nombre de copies, et (iv) pour toute finalité quelle qu’elle soit, y compris, et sans réserve, les finalités commerciales, publicitaires ou promotionnelles (la « Licence »). La Licence sera réputée effective à la date à laquelle le Déclarant aura appliqué CC0 à l'Œuvre. Dans le cas où une partie quelconque de la Licence serait jugée juridiquement nulle ou sans effet pour quelque raison que ce soit en vertu de la loi en vigueur, une telle invalidité partielle ou ineffectivité n'invalidera pas le reste de la Licence, et dans un tel cas, le Déclarant affirme par la présente qu'il ou elle (i) n'exercera aucun de ses Droits d'Auteur ou Droits Voisins subsistant sur l'Œuvre ou (ii) ne revendiquera aucune prétention, recours et possibilité d'action judiciaire relatifs à l'Œuvre qui serait opposé à la Déclaration d'Intention du Déclarant.
4. Limitations et Avertissements.
Aucun droit sur une marque ou brevet détenu par le Déclarant n'est cédé, abandonné, transmis, mis sous licence ou affecté d'une quelconque manière par le présent document.
Le Déclarant met à disposition l'Œuvre en l'état, sans déclaration ou garantie de quelque nature que ce soit concernant l'Œuvre, qu'elle soit explicite, implicite, réglementaire ou autre, y compris, et sans réserves, les garanties de titre, de qualité marchande, d'exactitude, d'adéquation à une fin particulière, d'absence de contrefaçon, d'erreurs, qu'elles soient ou non susceptibles d'être découvertes, de vices cachés ou apparents, dans la mesure de ce que permet la loi en vigueur.
Le Déclarant décline toute responsabilité d'acquérir les droits d'autres personnes qui seraient susceptible de s'appliquer à l'Œuvre ou à toute utilisation de celle-ci, y compris, et sans limitation, les Droits d'Auteur et Droits Voisins de toute personne sur l'Œuvre. En outre, le Déclarant décline toute responsabilité sur l'obtention de consentements, autorisations et autres droits requis pour toute utilisation de l'Œuvre.
Le Déclarant comprend et reconnaît que Creative Commons n'est pas partie à ce document et n'a aucun devoir ni obligation à l'égard de CC0 ou de l'utilisation de l'Œuvre.

Oświadczenie o Intencji
Ustawodawstwo obowiązujące w większości systemów prawnych automatycznie przyznaje wyłączne Prawa Autorskie i Pokrewne (zdefiniowane poniżej) twórcy i kolejnym uprawnionym (zwanym dalej, łącznie lub osobno, „uprawnionym") oryginalnego utworu i/lub bazy danych (zwanego dalej „Utworem").
Niektórzy uprawnieni chcą zrezygnować na zawsze z praw do danego Utworu, aby w ten sposób wnieść swój wkład do wspólnego zasobu dzieł twórczych, utworów artystycznych i dzieł naukowych („Wspólny Zasób"), który to zasób ogół społeczeństwa może, z poczuciem zaufania i bez obaw o późniejsze roszczenia, rozbudowywać, modyfikować, włączać do innych utworów, ponownie wykorzystywać lub rozpowszechniać w maksymalnie swobodny sposób, w jakiejkolwiek formie i do jakichkolwiek celów, w tym m.in. do celów komercyjnych. Tacy uprawnieni mogą wnosić swoje utwory do Wspólnego Zasobu w celu rozpowszechniania idei wolnej kultury i wspierania działalności twórczej owocującej powstawaniem dzieł twórczych, utworów artystycznych i dzieł naukowych, bądź w celu zyskania sławy lub szerszej znajomości ich Utworów, częściowo dzięki wykorzystywaniu tych Utworów przez inne osoby lub dzięki wysiłkom innych osób.
Kierując się powyższymi i/lub innymi celami i motywami, a nie oczekując żadnego dodatkowego świadczenia bądź wynagrodzenia, osoba opatrująca określony Utwór oznaczeniem CC0 („Składający Oświadczenie"), w zakresie, w jakim ta osoba jest uprawnionym z tytułu Praw Autorskich i Praw Pokrewnych do Utworu, dobrowolnie decyduje się zastosować CC0 do ww. Utworu i rozpowszechnić go publicznie zgodnie z warunkami CC0, mając świadomość posiadanych Praw Autorskich i Pokrewnych do Utworu, jak i znaczenia i skutku prawnego, który CC0 wywrze na te prawa.
1. Prawo Autorskie i Prawa Pokrewne. Utwór udostępniany zgodnie z CC0 może podlegać ochronie przez prawa autorskie jak i prawa pokrewne („Prawo Autorskie i Prawa Pokrewne"). Prawa Autorskie i Prawa Pokrewne obejmują m.in.:
prawo do zwielokrotniania, tworzenia opracowań, rozpowszechniania, wykonywania, wystawiania, przekazywania,i tłumaczenia Utworu;
prawa osobiste przysługujące autorowi lub autorom i/lub wykonawcy bądź wykonawcom;
prawa do ochrony wizerunku i prywatności odnoszące się do obrazu lub podobizny danej osoby, przedstawionej w Utworze;
prawa chroniące przed nieuczciwą konkurencją w zakresie Utworu z zastrzeżeniem ograniczeń wskazanych w paragrafie 4(a) poniżej;
prawa chroniące pobieranie danych z Utworu oraz ich rozpowszechnianie, wykorzystywanie i ponowne wykorzystywanie;
prawa do baz danych (np. prawa wynikające z dyrektywy 96/9/WE Parlamentu Europejskiego i Rady z dnia 11 marca 1996 r. w sprawie ochrony prawnej baz danych, lub z krajowych aktów prawnych stanowiących implementację tej dyrektywy, włącznie ze znowelizowanymi lub kolejnymi wersjami tej dyrektywy); i
inne podobne bądź równoważne prawa lub prawa wyżej wymienionym prawom odpowiadające, obowiązujące na całym świecie, a oparte o stosowne przepisy lub traktaty i wszelkie implementacje tychże do prawa krajowego.
2. Zrzeczenie się Praw. W maksymalnym zakresie dopuszczalnym przez prawo właściwe a jednocześnie go nienaruszającym, Składający Oświadczenie niniejszym otwarcie, całkowicie, definitywnie, nieodwołalnie i bezwarunkowo zrzeka się, rezygnuje z, i oddaje wszystkie swoje Prawa Autorskie i Prawa Pokrewne oraz zrzeka się i rezygnuje ze związanych z tymi prawami roszczeń i podstaw powództwa, aktualnie znanych bądź jeszcze nieznanych (włącznie z istniejącymi oraz przyszłymi roszczeniami i podstawami powództwa), do Utworu (i) na wszystkich terytoriach na całym świecie, (ii) na maksymalny czas trwania przewidziany stosownym przepisem lub traktatem (włącznie z przedłużeniami tego czasu w przyszłości), (iii) w odniesieniu do jakiegokolwiek obecnego lub przyszłego nośnika i do jakiejkolwiek liczby egzemplarzy, i (iv) dla jakiegokolwiek celu, w tym m.in. dla celów komercyjnych, reklamowych lub promocyjnych („Zrzeczenie się Praw").

Präambel
Durch die Lizenz « Freie Kunst » wird die Erlaubnis verliehen, Kunstwerke uneingeschränkt zu kopieren, zu verbreiten oder zu verändern- in voller Berücksichtigung der allgemeinen Urheber-rechte. Hierbei handelt es sich nicht um ihre Aufhebung- da ihre Rechtmässigkeit nach wie vor anerkannt und respektiert wird-sondern um die Neuformulierung der Rechtslage, die der Allgemeinheit einen freien und kreativen Umgang mit Kunstwerken ermöglicht.
Dort, wo die Urheberrechte im Bereich von Kunst und Literatur zu einer Beschränkung der Verwendung ihrer Werke führen, bemüht sich die Lizenz « Freie Kunst » effizient zu intervenieren, um den Zugang zur Kunst zu erleichtern.
Die Lizenz vertritt folgende Absichten : Vereinfachung des Zuganges zu den Ressourcen eines Kunstwerkes sowie die Ermächtigung der Allgemeinheit zur Weiterverwendung ebensolcher.
Von Kunst Nutzen zur grösstmöglichen Freude aller zu ziehen, neu Bedingungen des künstlerischen Schaffens zu erstellen, um die Möglichkeiten des Schaffens zu vervielfachen, wobei die Urheberrechte in ihrer Gültigkeit unangetastet bleiben.
Die rapide Zunahme der Präsenz von elektronischen Medien in unserer Zeit, die Erfindung des Internets und der freien Computerprogramme haben dazu geführt, dass neue Formen des Schaffens und der Produktion aufgekommen sind.
Die hier präsentierte Lizenz stellt darüberhinaus das Resultat einer Folge
von Versuchen dar, welche mehrere zeitgenösische Künstler bereits im Vorfeld
erprobt haben.
Wissen und künstlerisches Schaffen sind Schätze, welche in jeder Hinsicht frei und frei zugänglich bleiben müssen, um ihrer Definition als universale Güter so nah als möglich zu kommen.
Diese Schätze sind als Ausgangspunkt von Forschung und Recherche zu verstehen (im kulturellen wie persönlichen Sinne), die nicht zwingend in eine konkrete Anwendung münden müssen.
Schaffen heisst, das Unbekannte zu entdecken, die Wirklichkeit ohne Rücksicht auf Realität zu erfinden.
Auf diese Art und Weise soll das Kunstobjekt nicht mit einem fertigen und definiertem Gegenstück verwechselt werden.
Dies ist zugleich auch der Hauptgrund sowie die Hauptnotwendigkeit der « Freie Kunst »-Lizenz : das Ausüben von Kunst zu unterstützen und vor den scheinbar einzig gültigen Regeln des Marktes zu schützen.

2/ um es frei und uneingeschränkt verbreiten zu können
3/ um ihm die Möglichkeit zu geben, sich zu entwickeln, indem die Erlaubnis zur Veränderung durch Dritte gegeben ist
4/ damit Sie selbst die Möglichkeit haben, die Ressourcen eines Werkes zu verwenden, sofern jenes der Lizenz « Artlibre » unterliegt : das bedeutet, dass Sie es somit frei und uneingeschränkt kopieren, verbreiten und modifizieren können.
5/ Das ist nocht nicht alles !
Denn die Verwendung der Lizenz « Artlibre » stellt auch ein gutes Mittel dar, sich Freiheiten im dominierenden Wirtschaftssystem zu verschaffen. Die Lizenz « Artlibre » bietet einen interessanten juristischen Rahmen an, in welchem jegliche unrechtliche Aneignung des Werkes verhindert wird. Dadurch ist es nicht mehr möglich, sich eines Werkes anzueignen, um allgemeines Schaffen « kurz zu schliessen », das heisst zu umgehen und exklusiven Profit aus ihm zu ziehen. Es ist untersagt, sich eine Gemeinschaftsarbeit, die dem Werk angehört, unter den Nagel zu reissen, es ist untersagt, die Ressourcen des aktuellen Schaffens zum Nutzen von Einzelpersonen monopolisieren zu wollen.
Die Lizenz « Artlibre » verteidigt eine der Kunst eigenen Wirtschaft, die auf Teilen basiert, auf Austausch und « fröhliches Freigebigsein ». Was in der Kunst zählt, ist vor allen Dingen das, was sich nicht zählen und kalkulieren lässt.
Wann kann man die Lizenz « Artlibre » verwenden ?
Es liegt nicht in der Absicht der Lizenz « Artlibre », das Copyright-System oder die Urheberrechte aufzuheben. Ganz im Gegenteil, sie versucht, ihre Sachdienlichkeit neuzuformulieren, indem sie die aktuelle Lage berücksichtigt. Es geht darum, die Erlaubnis zur freien Verbreitung, zum freien Kopieren und zum Verändern der Kunstwerke zu erhalten.
1/ Jedesmal, wenn Sie von diesem Recht Nutzen ziehen oder anderen dieses Recht zukommen lassen wollen, sollten Sie diese Lizenz verwenden.
2/ Jedesmal, wenn Sie gedenken, Werke zu schaffen, die sich entwickeln und uneingeschränkt kopierbar, verbreit – oder modifizierbar sein sollen, verwenden Sie die Lizenz « Artlibre » !
3/ Jedesmal, wenn Sie ein Werk zu kopieren, zu verbreiten oder zu modifizieren wünschen : Vergewissern Sie sich, dass sie unter der Lizenz « Artlibre » steht !
Im gegenteiligen Falle gehen sie das Risiko ein, illegal zu handeln.
Welchen Typen an Werken entspricht die Lizenz « Artlibre » ?
Diese Lizenz findet sowohl bei digitalen als auch bei nichtdigitalen Werken ihre Anwendung. Ihre Enstehung lässt sich auf die Domäne der freien Computerprogramme und des Internets zurückverfolgen, was nicht bedeutet, dass sie sich ausschliesslich auf diese Bereiche anwenden lässt. Sie können die Lizenz für ein Gemälde, einen Roman, eine Plastik, eine Musik, ein Gedicht, eine Performance, kurz, für sämtliche Kreationen verwenden, die auf die Bezeichnung « Kunst » Anspruch erheben
Diese Lizenz hat eine Geschichte
Sie ist das Resultat des Gipfels von « Copyleft Attitude », der in den Räumlichkeiten von « Accès Local et Public » (Anmk.d. Üb.: « örtlicher und öffentlicher Zugang ») 2000 in Paris stattfand.
Zum ersten Mal führte ein Gipfel Informatiker, freischaffende Künstler, Miwirkende an dieser Lizenz sowie Personen aus dem Bereich der Kunst zusammen.

                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
11. RELICENSING
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

ntroducción:
La Licencia Arte Libre (LAL) le autoriza a copiar, difundir y transformar libremente la obra que protege, dentro del respeto a los derechos de su autor.
La Licencia Arte Libre no ignora los derechos del autor, sino que los reconoce y protege. La reformulación de estos principios permite a los usuarios utilizar con creatividad la obra artística.
El uso del derecho de propiedad literaria y artística tiende a imponer restricciones de acceso a los usuarios, que la Licencia Arte Libre pretende favorecer.
Su finalidad es dar acceso abierto a la obra y autorizar el uso de sus recursos por una mayoría, multiplicar las posibilidades de disfrute para multiplicar sus frutos, y fomentar un nuevo marco de creación que posibilite una creación nueva. Todo ello, dentro del respeto, reconocimiento y defensa de los derechos morales de los autores.
Acontecimientos como la tecnología digital, la invención de Internet y el software libre señalan la aparición de un nuevo marco de creación y producción. Estos fenómenos recogen y amplifican muchas de las experiencias llevadas a cabo por artistas contemporáneos.
El saber y la creación son recursos que deben permanecer libres para seguir siendo lo que son: conocimientos y creación, una labor de investigación fundamental, que no está determinada por sus aplicaciones concretas. Crear es descubrir lo desconocido, un acto que crea la realidad sin pretensión realista.
El fin del arte no se confunde con el objeto artístico ni en su finición, ni en su definición.
En todo ello radica la razón de ser de la Licencia Arte Libre: promover y proteger prácticas artísticas liberadas de las reglas exclusivistas de la economía de mercado.

No entra dentro del proyecto de la Licencia Arte Libre eliminar el copyright o los derechos de autor. Al contrario, se trata de afianzar su pertinencia dentro del entorno contemporáneo. Su finalidad es concederse la autorización para la circulación libre, la copia libre y la transformación libre de la obra: se trata del derecho al libre ejercicio del arte y de los artistas.
1/ Siempre que desee beneficiarse y hacer que otros se beneficien de este derecho, utilice la Licencia Arte Libre.
2/ Siempre que desee crear obras para que puedan evolucionar, ser copiadas, difundidas y transformadas libremente: utilice la Licencia Arte Libre.

– ¿A qué categorías de obras conviene la Licencia Arte Libre?
Esta licencia se aplica tanto a las obras electrónicas como a las que no lo son. Nace de la observación del mundo del software libre y de Internet, pero su ámbito de aplicación no está limitado por los soportes electrónicos.

Préambule :
Avec cette Licence Art Libre, l’autorisation est donnée de copier, de diffuser et de transformer librement les oeuvres dans le respect des droits de l’auteur.
Loin d’ignorer les droits de l’auteur, cette licence les reconnaît et les protège. Elle en reformule le principe en permettant au public de faire un usage créatif des oeuvres d’art.
Alors que l’usage fait du droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique conduit à restreindre l’accès du public à l’oeuvre, la Licence Art Libre a pour but de le favoriser.
L’intention est d’ouvrir l’accès et d’autoriser l’utilisation des ressources d’une oeuvre par le plus grand nombre. En avoir jouissance pour en multiplier les réjouissances, créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour amplifier les possibilités de création. Dans le respect des auteurs avec la reconnaissance et la défense de leur droit moral.
En effet, avec la venue du numérique, l’invention de l’internet et des logiciels libres, un nouveau mode de création et de production est apparu. Il est aussi l’amplification de ce qui a été expérimenté par nombre d’artistes contemporains.
Le savoir et la création sont des ressources qui doivent demeurer libres pour être encore véritablement du savoir et de la création. C’est à dire rester une recherche fondamentale qui ne soit pas directement liée à une application concrète. Créer c’est découvrir l’inconnu, c’est inventer le réel avant tout souci de réalisme.
Ainsi, l’objet de l’art n’est pas confondu avec l’objet d’art fini et défini comme tel.
C’est la raison essentielle de cette Licence Art Libre : promouvoir et protéger des pratiques artistiques libérées des seules règles de l’économie de marché.

Preambolo
Con questa licenza Arte Libera è permesso copiare, diffondere e trasformare liberamente le opere rispettando i diritti dell’autore originario.
Questa licenza non ignora affatto i diritti d’autore, anzi li riconosce e li protegge. Essa ne riformula lo spirito consentendo al pubblico di fare un uso creativo delle opere d’arte.
Dal momento che l’uso fatto del diritto della proprietà letteraria e artistica conduce a restringere l’accesso del pubblico all’opera, la licenza Arte Libera ha invece lo scopo di favorirlo.
L’intenzione è di rendere l’opera accessibile e permettere l’utilizzo dei suoi contenuti da parte di più persone possibili: utilizzarla con lo scopo di incrementare il suo utilizzo, porre nuove condizioni per la creazione con lo scopo di moltiplicare le possibilità di creazione, nel rispetto degli autori con il riconoscimento e la difesa del loro diritto morale.
Infatti, con l’avvento dell’era digitale, con l’invenzione di Internet e del software libero, è comparso un nuovo modo di creare e di produrre. E’ anche il canale d’amplificazione di ciò che è stato sperimentato da numerosi artisti contemporanei. Il sapere e la creatività sono delle risorse che devono rimanere libere per essere davvero ciò che sono; e questo deve rimanere un obbiettivo fondamentale che non è legato direttamente ad un concreta applicazione. Creare è scoprire l’ignoto, è inventare il reale senza preoccuparsi del realismo. Così, l’obbiettivo dell’arte non dev’essere confuso con l’oggetto d’arte fatto e finito.
La ragione essenziale di questa licenza Arte Libera è promuovere e tutelare l’esercizio dell’arte libero dalle regole imposte dall’economia di mercato.
DEFINIZIONI
– L’opera: si tratta dell’opera condivisa, comprendendo l’opera originale così come tutte le modificazioni successive (gli originali conseguenti e le copie). E’ creata per iniziativa dell’autore originario che attraverso questa licenza definisce le condizioni in base alle quali vengono fatte le modifiche.
– L’opera originale: cioè l’opera creata dall’primo ideatore dell’opera condivisa, le cui copie saranno modificate da chi lo desidera.
– Le opere derivate: cioè i contributi degli autori che partecipano alla formazione dell’opera facendo uso dei diritti di riproduzione, di diffusione e di modificazione che la licenza conferisce loro.
– Originale (forma esteriore o contenuti dell’opera): esemplare datato dell’opera, della sua definizione, della sua suddivisione, o del suo programma che l’autore presenta come riferimento per tutti gli aggiornamenti, interpretazioni, copie o riproduzioni ulteriori.
– Copia: ciascuna riproduzione dell’originale ai sensi di questa licenza.
– Autore dell’opera originale: è la persona che ha creato l’opera all’origine della ramificazione delle modifiche. Attraverso questa licenza, l’autore determina le condizioni nelle quali si possono apportare le modifiche.
– Collaboratore: ciascuna persona che contribuisce alla creazione dell’opera. E’ l’autore di un’opera originale risultante dalla modifica di una copia dell’opera originaria o dall’ulteriore modifica di un’opera derivata.

§ Preambuła
Licencja Wolnej Sztuki przyznaje prawo do swobodnego kopiowania, rozpowszechniania i przekształcania twórczości bez naruszania praw autorskich.

Powszechny dostęp do dzieł ludzkiego umysłu, zwykle ograniczony przez obowiązujące prawa autorskie, jest preferowany przez licencję Wolnej Sztuki. Licencja ta ma na celu umożliwienie wykorzystania dzieła, w celu ustalenia nowych warunków, zwiększających możliwości tworzenia. Licencja Wolnej Sztuki przyznaje prawo do korzystania z utworu; uznaje prawo właściciela praw autorskich oraz prawa i obowiązki użytkownika.
Wynalazek i rozwój technologii cyfrowych, Internetu i Wolnego Oprogramowania zmieniły metody tworzenia. Dzieła ludzkiego umysłu mogą być dystrybuowane, wymieniane, i przekształcane. Pozwala to na tworzenie wspólnych dzieł, do których każdy może wnieść swój wkład z korzyścią dla wszystkich.
Głównym powodem działania Licencji Wolnej Sztuki jest promowanie i ochrona dzieł ludzkiego umysłu, zgodnie z zasadami Copyleft: swoboda używania, kopiowania, rozpowszechniania, przekształcania oraz zakaz wyłącznego asygnowania.
§ Definicje
„Dzieło” oznacza zarówno „dzieło początkowe”, jak i kolejne „dzieła pokrewne” lub „dzieło wspólne”, i tak:

„Oryginały” (źródła i zasoby dzieła) oznaczają wszystkie kopie dzieła początkowego lub kolejnych dzieł pokrewnych, oznaczone datą i wykorzystywane przez ich autora (autorów) jako odniesienie przy kolejnych aktualizacjach, interpretacjach, kopiach lub reprodukcjach.
„Kopia” oznacza każdą reprodukcję oryginału w rozumieniu niniejszej licencji.

§ 7. ODPOWIEDZIALNOŚĆ
Wolność do korzystania z dzieła zgodnie z założeniami Licencji Wolnej Sztuki (prawo do kopiowania, rozpowszechniania i przekształcanie) zakłada, że każdy jest odpowiedzialny za własne czyny.
§ 8. CZAS TRWANIA LICENCJI

Tło historyczne Licencji Wolnej Sztuki:
Licencja Wolnej Sztuki jest wynikiem obserwacji, korzystania i tworzenia technologii cyfrowych, wolnego oprogramowania, Internetu i sztuki. Powstała podczas spotkań Copyleft Attitude, które odbyły się w Paryżu w 2000 roku. Po raz pierwszy w spotkaniach tych wzięli udział członkowie społeczności wolnego oprogramowania, artyści i przedstawiciele świata sztuki. Za cel postawiono sobie dostosowanie zasad Copyleft i Wolnego Oprogramowania do wszystkich rodzajów twórczości.

Preâmbulo
A Licença da Arte Livre autoriza você a copiar livremente, distribuir e transformar trabalhos criativos sem infringir os direitos do autor.
A Licença da Arte Livre reconhece e protege estes direitos. Sua implementação foi reformulada no sentido de permitir à todos utilizar-se das criações do intelecto humano de uma maneira criativa, independentemente de seus gêneros e formas de expressão.
Enquanto o acesso do público às criações intelectuais é freqüentemente restringido pela lei do copyright, com a Licença da Arte Livre o acesso é incentivado. Esta licença se propõe a permitir a utilização dos recursos que constituem uma obra; estabelecer novas condições para a criação no sentido de amplificar as possibilidades de e da criação. A Licença da Arte Livre permite o uso das obras e reconhece o direito do autor, os direitos dos receptores e suas responsabilidades.
A invenção e desenvolvimento das tecnologias digitais, a Internet e o Software Livre mudaram a forma de e da criação: criações intelectuais podem obviamente ser compartilhadas, trocadas e transformadas. As novas tecnologias digitais favorecem a produção de obras comuns que todos podem melhorar para o benefício de todos.
A principal justificativa para a Licença da Arte Livre é promover e proteger essas criações intelectuais de acordo com os princípios do copyleft: liberdade para usar, copiar, compartilhar, transformar, e a proibição da apropriação exclusiva.
Definições
« obra » significa tanto a obra inicial, quanto as subseqüentes ou a obra comum, como definidas a seguir:
« obra comum » significa uma obra composta da obra inicial e de todas as subseqüentes contribuições à ela (originais e cópias). O autor inicial é o que, por escolher esta licença, define as condições sob as quais cada contribuição é feita.
« obra inicial » significa o trabalho criado pelo iniciador da obra comum (como definida acima), cujas cópias podem ser modificadas por quem desejar.
« obras subseqüentes » significa as contribuições feitas por autores que participam na evolução da obra comum exercitando seus direitos de reproduzir, distribuir e modificar que são permitidas pela licença.
« originais » (obras fonte ou recursos) significa todas as cópias da obra inicial ou das obras subseqüentes, datadas e usadas por seus autores como referências para quaisquer atualizações, interpretações, cópias ou reproduções subseqüentes.
« cópia » significa qualquer reprodução de um original como definido por esta licença.
1. OBJETO
O objetivo dessa licença é definir as condições sob as quais se poderá desfrutar livremente da obra licenciada por esta licença.
2. ESCOPO
A obra licenciada por esta licença está sujeita à lei de copyright. Através desta licença, o autor da obra licenciada especifica uma extensão que permite que você possa copiar, distribuir e modificar a obra.
2.1 LIBERDADE PARA COPIAR (OU PARA REPRODUZIR)
Você tem o direito de copiar este trabalho para si, para seus amigos ou qualquer outra pessoa, independentemente da técnica utilizada.
2.2 LIBERDADE PARA DISTRIBUIR, APRESENTAR EM PÚBLICO
Você tem o direito de distribuir cópias desta obra; sejam modificadas ou não, em qualquer mídia ou lugar, com ou sem cobrança de valores, desde que você:
anexe esta licença sem quaisquer modificações às cópias desta obra ou indique precisamente onde a licença pode ser encontrada,
especifique para o receptor os nomes dos autores das obras originais, incluindo o seu caso tenha modificado a obra,
especifique para o receptor onde ele poderá ter acesso aos originais (tanto da obra inicial quanto das subseqüentes).
Os autores dos originais podem, se desejarem, conceder o direito de distribuir os originais nas mesmas condições que as cópias.
2.3 LIBERDADE PARA MODIFICAR
Você tem o direito de modificar cópias dos originais (inicial ou subseqüentes) contanto que você cumpra com as seguintes condições:
todas as condições no artigo 2.2 acima, se você distribuir as cópias modificadas;
indicar que a obra foi modificada e, se possível, que tipo de modificações foram feitas;
distribuir o trabalho subseqüente sob a mesma licença ou qualquer licença compatível.
Os autores da obra original podem lhe conceder o direito de modificá-la nas mesmas condições que as cópias.
3. DIREITOS RELACIONADOS
Atividades ou ações relacionadas aos direitos do autor e direitos relacionados não podem interferir com os direitos previstos por esta licença.
Por exemplo, esta é a razão por que performances devem estar sujeitas à mesma licença ou licença compatível. Similarmente, integrar a obra num banco de dados, compilação ou antologia não pode impedir a utilização da obra sob as mesmas condições definidas por esta licença.
4. INCORPORAÇÃO DA OBRA
Incorporar a obra numa obra maior não sujeita à Licença da Arte Livre não pode interferir com os direitos previstos por esta licença.
Se a obra não poder ser acessada à parte da obra maior em que foi incorporada, então esta incorporação só será permitida na condição de que a obra maior esteja licenciada sob a Licença da Arte Livre ou licença compatível.
5. COMPATIBILIDADE
Uma licença é compatível com a Licença da Arte Livre desde que:
ela dê o direito da cópia, distribuição e modificação de cópias da obra, incluindo para propósitos comerciais, e sem quaisquer outras restrições que não as impostas pela observância dos outros critérios de compatibilidade;
ela assegura atribuição da obra aos autores e o acesso a versões anteriores da obra sempre que possível;
ela reconhece a Licença da Arte Livre como compatível (reciprocidade);
ela requer que as modificações feitas à obra estão sujeitas à mesma licença ou à alguma licença que também observe este critério de compatibilidade.
6. SEUS DIREITOS AUTORAIS
O objetivo desta licença não é negar seus direitos enquanto autor na sua contribuição nem quaisquer direitos relacionados. Por escolher contribuir na evolução de uma obra comum, você apenas concorda em ceder a terceiros os mesmos direitos sob sua contribuição em relação aos que lhe foram concedidos por esta licença. Ceder estas permissões não implica em ceder seus direitos autorais.
7. SUAS RESPONSABILIDADES
A liberdade de uso da obra como definido pela Licença da Arte Livre (direito de cópia, distribuição e modificação) implica que todos são responsáveis por suas próprias ações.
8. DURAÇÃO DA LICENÇA
Esta licença tem efeito a partir da aceitação de seus termos. O ato de copiar, distribuir ou modificar a obra constitui uma aceitação tácita. Esta licença irá manter-se em efeito no mesmo período que o copyright que está anexado à obra. Se você não respeitar os termos desta licença, irá automaticamente perder os direitos que ela lhe confere.
Se o status legal ou a legislação que você está sujeito tornam impossível respeitar os termos desta licença, então você não poderá fazer uso dos direitos que ela lhe confere.
9. VÁRIAS VERSÕES DA LICENÇA
Esta licença poderá sofrer modificações periódicas para incorporar melhorias por seus autores (instigadores do movimento « Copyleft Atitude ») através de novas versões numeradas.
Você sempre terá a escolha de aceitar os termos contidos na versão em que a obra está licenciada, ou alternativamente, usar uma das versões subseqüentes.
10. SUB-LICENCIAMENTO
Sub-licenças não são autorizadas pela presente licença. Qualquer pessoa que deseje fazer uso dos direitos que a licença confere estará diretamente ligada aos autores da obra comum.
11. SUPORTE LEGAL PARA INTERPRETAR ESTA LICENÇA
Esta licença foi escrita respeitando tanto a lei francesa quanto a Convernção de Berne pela Proteção de Obras Artísticas e Literárias.

                GNU Free Documentation License
                   Version 1.1, March 2000
 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

     <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
11. RELICENSING
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

                    51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                            Preamble
  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:
    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and
    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.
    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.
Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.
  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                            NO WARRANTY
  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                            Preamble
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
                            NO WARRANTY
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

Obecná veřejná licence GNU v.3 (GNU GPL v.3)
This is an unofficial translation of the GNU General Public License into Czech. It was not published by the Free Software Foundation, and does not legally state the distribution terms for software that uses the GNU GPL - only the original English text of the GNU GPL does that. However, we hope that this translation will help Czech speakers understand the GNU GPL better.
Tento text je neoficiálním českým překladem GNU General Public License (Obecné veřejné licence GNU). Nebyl vydán nadací Free Software Foundation a tak právně neupravuje distribuční podmínky softwaru, který je licencován pod GNU GPL. Právně závazný je pouze anglický originál GNU GPL. Doufáme ale, že překlad pomůže českým čtenářům lépe porozumět GNU GPL.
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Kopírování a distribuce doslovných kopií tohoto licenčního dokumentu jsou povoleny, ale jeho úpravy jsou zakázány.
Preambule
Obecná veřejná licence GNU (v angličtině GNU General Public License, dále jen jako “GNU GPL” nebo “GPL”) je svobodná, “copyleft” (část autorských práv ponechává a části se zříká) licence pro software a jiná díla.
Většina licencí pro software a jiná díla jsou navrženy tak, aby omezovaly svobodu jeho sdílení a úprav. Naproti tomu, Obecná veřejná licence GNU zaručuje svobodu sdílení a úprav všech verzí programu – aby byl software svobodný pro všechny jeho uživatele. My, ze Free Software Foundation, používáme Obecnou veřejnou licenci GNU pro většinu našich programů, ale licence se vztahuje i na díla jiných autorů, kteří se je rozhodli zveřejnit právě tímto způsobem. Můžete ji rovněž použít pro své programy.
Pokud mluvíme o svobodném softwaru, myslíme tím svobodu používání, nikoliv cenu. Naše Obecné veřejné licence jsou navrženy tak, abyste mohli volně šířit kopie svobodného softwaru (a pokud chcete, nechat si za to i zaplatit), abyste obdrželi zdrojový kód, nebo ho měli možnost získat, abyste mohli tento software měnit nebo jeho části použít v nových programech a abyste věděli, že tyto věci smíte dělat.
Abychom mohli chránit vaše práva, musíme zabránit tomu, aby vám kdokoliv tato práva odepíral, nebo vás žádal, abyste se těchto práv vzdali. Proto i vy máte určité povinnosti, které musíte dodržet, pokud šíříte nebo upravujete takový software, a to povinnost respektovat svobodu ostatních.
Například, šíříte-li kopie programu, ať již zdarma nebo za poplatek, příjemci musíte poskytnout stejná práva, jaké jste sami obdrželi. Musíte zaručit, že příjemci rovněž dostanou, anebo mohou získat zdrojový kód. A aby i oni znali svá práva, musíte je upozornit na tyto podmínky.
Vývojáři, kteří používají GNU GPL, chrání vaše práva ve dvou krocích: (1) zabezpečením autorských práv k softwaru, a (2) nabídkou této Licence, která vám dává právoplatné svolení k jeho kopírování, šíření a/nebo jeho úpravě.
Kvůli ochraně každého vývojáře a autora, GPL dává jasně najevo, že pro svobodný software neexistuje žádná záruka. V zájmu obou stran, uživatelů i autorů, GPL požaduje, aby upravené verze programu byly příslušně označeny, a to kvůli tomu, aby za původce případných chyb programu nebyli nesprávně označeni autoři původních verzí.
Některá zařízení uživatelům zakazují instalaci nebo spuštění upravených verzí softwaru, i když výrobce si takovou možnost ponechal. Toto je z principu neslučitelné s cílem ochrany uživatelské svobody – svobody jakkoli software měnit. Takové porušování se systematicky vyskytuje tam, kde je program určen pro jednotlivce, tedy tam, kde je to nejméně přijatelné. Abychom takovým počinem předešli, vytvořili jsme tuto verzi GPL. Jestliže problémy tohoto druhu budou nadále vznikat, jsme připraveni je podle potřeby ošetřit v následujících verzích GPL.
Závěrem, každý program je neustále ohrožen softwarovými patenty. Státy by neměly povolovat patenty pro zamezení vývoje a použití softwaru, který je určen pro všeobecné použití. Ale u těch, které tak činí, bychom rádi zamezili nebezpečí, že by distributoři svobodného programu obdrželi samostatná patentová osvědčení a tím by učinili takový program vázaným. Abychom tomu zamezili, GPL zaručuje, že patenty nemohou činit program nesvobodným.
Přesná ustanovení a podmínky pro kopírování, šíření a upravování naleznete níže.
USTANOVENÍ a PODMÍNKY
0. Definice
Označením “tato Licence” se myslí 3. verze Obecné veřejné licence GNU.
“Autorskými právy” se myslí i zákony příbuzné autorským právům, vztahující se na jiné druhy díl, jako např. polovodičové masky.
“Programem” se označuje jakékoli dílo, které může být chráněno autorskými právy a je licencováno touto Licencí. Uživatel licence se označuje jako “vy”. “Uživatelé licence” a “příjemci licence” mohou být jednotlivci nebo organizace.
“Upravováním” díla se rozumí zkopírování nebo přizpůsobení celého nebo jen části díla způsobem, který vyžaduje autorská práva. Nemyslí se tím vytvoření přesné kopie. Výsledné dílo se nazývá “upravenou verzí” původního díla nebo dílo “založené na” původním díle.
“Chráněným dílem” se myslí neupravená verze Programu nebo dílo založené na Programu.
“Šířením” díla se označuje jakákoli činnost, která by vás činila přímo či nepřímo odpovědnými za porušení Zákona o ochraně autorských práv, kromě spouštění díla na osobním počítači nebo vytváření vlastní kopie. Šíření zahrnuje kopírování, distribuci (s nebo bez úpravy), zpřístupnění veřejnosti a v některých zemích i další aktivity.
“Zveřejnit” dílo značí jakýkoliv druh šíření, které dalším stranám umožňuje výrobu nebo pořízení kopií. Běžné používání díla přes počítačovou síť, bez přenosu kopie k uživateli, se nepovažuje za zveřejnění díla.
Interaktivní uživatelské prostředí zobrazuje “Příslušné právní podmínky” v takovém rozsahu, že jsou uživateli pohodlně vnímatelné a umístěny na dobře viditelném místě a (1) oznam zobrazuje Příslušné právní podmínky a (2) oznamuje uživateli, že na dílo se nevztahuje záruka (kromě případů, kdy se záruka uděluje), že uživatelé licence mohou dílo na základě této Licence dále zveřejňovat a oznamuje, kde si mohou tuto Licenci přečíst. Pokud uživatelské prostředí obsahuje seznam uživatelských příkazů, dobře viditelné umístění v takovém menu splňuje toto kritérium.
1. Zdrojový kód
“Zdrojový kód” označuje preferovanou formu díla určenou na jeho úpravy. “Strojovým kódem” se označuje jakákoli nezdrojová forma díla.
“Standardním rozhraním” se myslí rozhraní, které je buď uznáno jako oficiální standard definován uznávanou standardizující autoritou, nebo, v případě rozhraní určených pro určitý programovací jazyk, je to rozhraní, které je uznané širokou vývojářskou veřejností daného jazyka.
“Systémové knihovny” spustitelného díla zahrnují vše (kromě díla jako celku), co (a) je zahrnuto v běžné formě balení hlavního komponentu, ale není součástí hlavního komponentu a (b) slouží pouze pro usnadnění práce s hlavní komponentou, nebo k implementaci standardního rozhraní tam, kde je implementace formou zdrojového kódu veřejnosti povolena. V tomto kontextu se “hlavní komponentou” myslí hlavní nezbytná součást (jádro, správce oken, atp.) daného operačního systému (pokud nějaký je), na kterém spustitelné dílo běží, nebo kompilátor používaný ke spuštění díla, nebo spouštěč strojového kódu používaný k běhu díla.
“Úplný zdroj” díla značí veškerý zdrojový kód potřebný pro generování, instalaci, spouštění (pro spustitelná díla) strojového kódu a úpravu díla, včetně skriptů pro kontrolu těchto úkonů. Nezahrnuje systémové knihovny díla, nebo obecné nástroje nebo obecně přístupné svobodné programy, které jsou používány (v neupravené podobě) k provedení těchto úkonů a nejsou součástí díla. Například, Úplný zdroj zahrnuje soubory pro definici rozhraní přidružené ke zdrojovým souborům díla, zdrojový kód sdílených knihoven a dynamicky navázané podprogramy, které dílo ke správnému fungování potřebuje – a to buď formou datové komunikace, nebo formou kontroly přenosu mezi podprogramy a jinými částmi díla.
Úplný zdroj nemusí obsahovat nic, co si mohou uživatelé automaticky vygenerovat z jiných částí Úplného zdroje.
Úplný zdroj pro dílo v podobě zdrojového kódu je dané dílo samo.
2. Základní privilegia
Všechna práva zaručená touto Licencí trvají po dobu platnosti autorského práva na Program a jsou neodvolatelné, pokud jsou dodrženy podmínky uvedené níže. Tato Licence explicitně potvrzuje vaše neomezené právo na spouštění neupraveného Programu. Výstup ze spuštění chráněného díla tato Licence upravuje pouze v případě, že výstup, vzhledem ke svému obsahu, představuje chráněné dílo samo. Tato Licence zároveň uznává vaše právo na “fair use” (správné používání) nebo jiný ekvivalent daný zákonem o autorském právu.
Dokud je vaše licence platná, můžete tvořit, spouštět a šířit chráněná díla bez jakýchkoli omezení, i když díla sami nezveřejňujete. Pro účely exkluzivních úprav děl výhradně ve váš prospěch nebo vytvoření prostředků ke spuštění těchto děl, můžete chráněná díla zveřejnit pouze v případě, že v souladu s podmínkami této Licence zveřejníte všechny materiály, ke kterým nevlastníte autorská práva. A ti, kteří tvoří a spouštějí chráněná díla za vás, musí tak činit výhradně vaším jménem, s vaším usměrňováním a pod vaší kontrolou, v podmínkách, které jim mimo vztahu s vámi zakazují tvořit jakékoli kopie vašeho materiálu, ke kterému jste držitelem autorských práv.
Za jiných okolností zveřejnění díla podléhá podmínkám uvedeným níže. Sublicencování není povoleno, odstavec 10 ho činí zbytečným.
3. Ochrana zákonných práv uživatelů před Zákonem proti obcházení
Žádné chráněné dílo by nemělo být považováno za součást efektivních technologických prostředků na základě platných právních předpisů podle článku 11, Smlouvy WIPO o autorských právech, přijaté dne 20. prosince 1996, nebo obdobných zákonů zakazujících nebo omezujících obcházení takových prostředků.
Pokud zveřejníte chráněné dílo, zříkáte se jakékoliv právní moci zakázat obcházení technologických prostředků kromě případu, kdy by takové obcházení bylo provedeno na základě práva vyplývajícího z této Licence. Zároveň se zříkáte jakéhokoliv záměru omezit provoz nebo úpravu díla kvůli prosazení zákonných práv (v rozporu s uživateli díla) vašich nebo třetí strany na zákaz obcházení technologických prostředků.
4. Zveřejňování doslovných kopií
Doslovné kopie zdrojového kódu Programu můžete zveřejňovat tak, jak jste jej obdržel, za pomoci libovolného média, ale pouze za předpokladu, že na každé kopii uvedete zmínku o autorovi a absenci záruky na vhodném a viditelném místě, že všechny zmínky odkazující na tuto Licenci a na jakoukoli přidanou podmínku podle odstavce 7 ponecháte beze změn a že zároveň ponecháte nedotčené všechny zmínky o absenci záruky a všem příjemcům zprostředkujete kopii této Licence spolu s Programem.
Za každou zveřejněnou kopii si můžete účtovat peníze (ale nemusíte) a také můžete nabízet služby zákaznické podpory nebo záruku za poplatek.
5. Zveřejňování upravených verzí zdroje
Dílo založené na Programu, nebo úpravy na vytvoření díla založené na Programu, můžete zveřejňovat ve formě zdrojového kódu dle platných podmínek odstavce 4, za předpokladu, že zároveň splníte všechny následující podmínky:
a) Dílo musí obsahovat zřetelnou zmínku o tom, že bylo upraveno, spolu s datem jeho úpravy.
b) Dílo musí obsahovat zřetelnou zmínku o tom, že bylo vydáno pod touto Licencí a zmínku o jakýchkoliv přidaných podmínkách v souladu s odstavcem 7. Tento požadavek upravuje požadavek na “ponechání všech zmínek beze změn” z odstavce 4.
c) Celé dílo musíte licencovat touto Licencí pro každého, kdo si kopii opatří, anebo s ní jinak přijde do styku. Licence se, spolu s jakýmikoli dalšími podmínkami podle odstavce 7, proto vztahuje na dílo jako celek a na všechny jeho části, bez ohledu na to, jak je dílo a jeho části balené. Tato Licence nedává povolení k licencování děl jiným způsobem, ale pokud jste toto povolení získali jinak, tato Licence takové povolení neruší.
d) Pokud dílo obsahuje interaktivní uživatelská rozhraní, každé z nich musí zobrazovat Příslušné právní podmínky. Pokud ale Program obsahuje interaktivní uživatelská rozhraní, která nezobrazují Příslušné právní podmínky, vaše dílo nemusí přinutit Program, aby je zobrazoval.
Kompilace chráněného díla s jinými vzájemně nezávislými díly, které ze své podstaty nejsou rozšířeními chráněného díla a které s ním nejsou kombinovány tak, aby tvořily jeden větší program na paměťovém médiu, či jiném distribučním médiu, se nazývá “agregát”, pokud kompilace a její výsledné autorská práva nejsou používány k omezování přístupu nebo zákonných práv uživatelů kompilace nad míru, kterou samostatná díla povolují. Zahrnutím chráněného díla do agregátu tato Licence nenabývá platnosti na jiné části agregátu.
6. Zveřejňování nezdrojových verzí
Dílo můžete zveřejňovat prostřednictvím strojového kódu podle odstavců 4 a 5, uvedených výše, pokud zveřejníte i strojem-čitelný Úplný zdroj dle ustanovení této Licence, jedním z následujících způsobů:
a) Zveřejníte strojový kód ve fyzickém produktu (včetně fyzického distribučního média), doplněný Úplným zdrojem uloženým na trvalém fyzickém médiu běžně používaném pro výměnu softwaru.
b) Zveřejníte strojový kód ve fyzickém produktu (včetně fyzického distribučního média), doplněný písemnou nabídkou platnou nejméně tři roky a tak dlouho, dokud pro ten daný model produktu nabízíte náhradní díly nebo zákaznickou podporu, abyste komukoliv, kdo si strojový kód opatří, poskytly buď (1) kopii Úplného zdroje pro veškerý software obsažený v produktu a chráněný touto Licencí na trvalém fyzickém médiu běžně používaném pro výměnu softwaru, za cenu nepřesahující náklady vzniklé na fyzické vyhotovení takové kopie, nebo (2) poskytli bezplatný přístup k Úplnému zdroji na síťovém serveru.
c) Zveřejníte jednotlivé kopie strojového kódu s kopií písemné nabídky zpřístupnit Úplný zdroj. Tato alternativa je povolena jen výjimečně, pro nekomerční účely a jen v případě, že jste i vy přijali strojový kód s takovou nabídkou, v souladu s odstavcem 6. b).
d) Zveřejníte strojový kód nabídkou přístupu z určeného místa (zdarma nebo za poplatek) a nabídnete rovnocenný přístup k Úplnému zdroji stejným způsobem, ze stejného místa a bez dodatečných poplatků. Od příjemců musíte vyžadovat, aby Úplný zdroj zkopírovali spolu se strojovým kódem. Pokud je tím místem na zkopírování strojového kódu síťový server, Úplný zdroj může být na jiném serveru (provozovaný vámi nebo třetí stranou), který podporuje ekvivalentní prostředky pro kopírování a za podmínky, že vedle strojového kódu zajistíte jasné instrukce o tom, jak Úplný zdroj najít. Nezávisle na tom, jaký server hostuje Úplný zdroj, jste povinen zajistit, že bude přístupný tak dlouho, dokud bude třeba tyto požadavky naplňovat.
e) Zveřejníte strojový kód pomocí peer-to-peer přenosu, za podmínky, že jiné počítače (peers) informujete, kde je ten strojový kód a Úplný zdroj díla zveřejněn zdarma, v souladu s odstavcem 6. d).
Oddělitelná část strojového kódu, jehož zdrojový kód nespadá do Úplného zdroje jako systémová knihovna, nemusí být součástí zveřejnění strojového kódu díla.
“Uživatelský produkt” je buď (1) “zákaznický produkt”, což znamená jakékoliv soukromé vlastnictví, které je běžně používané pro soukromé, rodinné účely a účely pro domácnost, nebo (2) cokoliv vytvořené a prodávané pro zabudování do obytných prostor. Pro určení toho, zda je produkt zákaznickým, sporné případy mají být rozhodnuty ve prospěch toho, že jimi jsou. Pro daný produkt přijat daným uživatelem, “běžné používání” znamená typické použití daného druhu produktu, nezávisle na daném uživateli nebo na konkrétním uživatelově způsobu použití, jeho očekávání, nebo očekávání, které se na uživatele kladou. Produkt je zákaznickým produktem nezávisle na tom, zda má produkt podstatné komerční, průmyslové, nebo ne-zákaznické využití, pokud taková využití představují jediný signifikantní způsob použití produktu.
“Instalační informace” pro uživatelský produkt jsou jakékoliv metody, procedury, autorizační klíče, nebo jiné informace potřebné k instalaci a spuštění upravených verzí chráněného díla v daném uživatelském produktu z upravené verze Úplného zdroje. Informace musí zajistit, že se v žádném případě nebude bránit nebo zasahovat nepřerušené funkcionalitě upraveného strojového kódu jen proto, že byly úpravy provedeny.
Pokud budete strojový kód zveřejňovat podle tohoto odstavce v, nebo se, nebo výhradně pro použití v zákaznickém produktu a zveřejnění bude součástí transakce, v níž se právo na držení a používání uživatelského produktu převádí na příjemce na neomezenou dobu nebo na dobu určitou (bez ohledu na to, jak je transakce charakterizována), Úplný zdroj zveřejněn na základě tohoto odstavce musí být doplněn o instalační informace. Tento požadavek však neplatí, pokud ani vy, ani žádná třetí strana si neponechává možnost instalovat upravený strojový kód pro uživatelský produkt (např. dílo bylo instalováno na ROM).
Požadavek poskytnutí instalačních informací nezahrnuje požadavek na pokračování v poskytování zákaznické podpory, záruky, nebo aktualizací pro dílo, které bylo upraveno nebo instalováno příjemcům, nebo pro uživatelský produkt, ve kterém byl upraven nebo instalován. Přístup k síti může být odmítnut, pokud by měla samotná úprava věcně a nepříznivě ovlivňovat chod sítě, nebo porušuje pravidla a protokoly pro komunikaci na síti.
Zveřejněný Úplný zdroj a uvedené instalační informace musí, v souladu s tímto odstavcem, být ve formátu, který je veřejně dokumentovaný (a s veřejně dostupnou implementací ve formě zdrojového kódu) a nemůže vyžadovat žádné speciální hesla nebo klíče pro rozbalení, čtení a kopírování.
7. Dodatečné podmínky
“Dodatečná práva” jsou podmínky, které doplňují podmínky této Licence výjimkami na jednu nebo více podmínek. Dodatečná práva, která se mohou vztahovat na celý Program, se považují za součást této Licence, ale jen dokud dodržují platné právní předpisy. Pokud se uplatní dodatečná práva pouze na část Programu, daná část se má používat zvlášť na základě těchto práv, ale na celý Program se vztahují podmínky této Licence bez dodatečných práv.
Pokud zveřejníte kopii chráněného díla, můžete z ní podle vlastní libosti odstranit kterékoli další práva, nebo jejich kteroukoliv část. (Dodatečné práva mohou být sestaveny tak, aby v některých případech úpravy díla požadovali samotné jejich odstranění.) Dodatečné práva můžete přidat na materiál, který byl ke chráněnému dílu přidán vámi, nebo pro které vlastníte, nebo můžete vydat, příslušná autorská práva.
Bez ohledu na jakákoli jiná ustanovení této Licence můžete pro materiál, který byl přidán ke chráněnému dílu (pokud vlastníte autorská práva k materiálu), rozšířit podmínky této Licence o podmínky:
a) Popřít záruku či omezit odpovědnost jiným způsobem, než je uvedeno v odstavci 15 a 16 této Licence, nebo
b) Požadovat uchování specifických odůvodněných zákonných vyhlášek nebo autorských příspěvků do materiálu, nebo do Příslušných právních podmínek zobrazovaných díly, které je obsahují, nebo
c) Zakázat zavádění o původu materiálu, nebo požadovat, aby byly upravené verze tohoto materiálu označeny přiměřeným způsobem, tedy jako odlišné od originálu, nebo
d) Omezit veřejné užívání jmen poskytovatelů licence nebo autorů materiálu, nebo
e) Popřít přenos práv podle Zákona o ochranných známkách pro některé ochranné známky, značky a servisní známky, nebo
f) Požadovat odškodnění poskytovatele licence a autorů materiálu od kohokoli, kdo zveřejní materiál (nebo jeho upravenou verzi) se smluvními závazky k příjemci, a za jakýkoli závazek, který smlouva přímo ukládá na poskytovatele licence a autorů.
Jiné zakazující dodatečné podmínky jsou ve smyslu odstavce 10 brané jako “další omezení”. Pokud Program, nebo jeho část, tak jak jste jej obdrželi, obsahuje zmínku o tom, že je licencovaný touto Licencí spolu s podmínkou, která je dalším omezením, můžete tuto podmínku odebrat. Pokud licenční dokument obsahuje další omezení, ale povoluje znovu-licencování a zveřejnění pod touto Licencí, můžete ke chráněnému dílu přidat materiál podléhající podmínkám toho licenčního dokumentu, ale pouze za podmínky, že další omezení se takovýmto znovu-licencováním nebo zveřejněním zruší.
Pokud ke chráněnému dílu přidáte podmínky v souladu s tímto odstavcem, do příslušných zdrojových souborů musíte umístit prohlášení o dodatečných podmínkách vztahující se na dané soubory, nebo zmínku o tom, kde tyto platné podmínky najít.
Dodatečné podmínky, povolující nebo zakazující, mohou být podány formou zvláštní napsané licence, nebo podány jako výjimky (ale nezávisle na způsobu, platí vše, co je výše uvedeno).
8. Ukončení
Šířit nebo upravovat chráněné dílo můžete výslovně jen pod touto Licencí. Jakákoli snaha šířit nebo upravovat dílo jiným způsobem, je porušením těchto podmínek a znamená automatické ukončení vašich práv plynoucích z této Licence (včetně jakýchkoliv patentových licencí udělených podle odstavce 11.3)).
Pokud napravíte všechny porušení této Licence, pak je vaše licence z daného autorského práva obnovena (a) dočasně, pokud a dokud držitel autorských práv výslovně a s konečnou platností neukončí vaši licenci a (b) trvale, pokud se držiteli autorských práv nepodaří vhodnými prostředky vás o porušení seznámit do 60 dnů po ukončení.
Navíc, vaše licence od daného držitele autorských práv se natrvalo obnovuje i v případě, že vás držitel autorských práv vhodnými prostředky informuje o porušení a toto je poprvé, co jste obeznámení o porušení této Licence (pro jakékoli dílo) od toho držitele autorských práv obdrželi a vy napravíte porušení do 30 dnů po doručení oznámení.
Ukončení vašich práv podle tohoto odstavce neukončuje licenci stran, které na základě této Licence obdržely kopie nebo práva od vás. Pokud byly vaše práva ukončeny a nebyly natrvalo obnoveny, nemáte právo přijmout nové licence pro daný materiál vyplývající z odstavce 10.
9. Přijetí Licence není povinné pro držení kopií
Pro přijímání nebo spouštění kopie Programu nejste povinen tuto Licenci přijmout. Pokud je to pouze výsledkem použití přenosu peer-to-peer, ani pomocné šíření chráněného díla nevyžaduje přijetí. Nic jiného než tato Licence vám ale nedává možnost kopírovat nebo šířit chráněné dílo. V případě, že tuto Licenci nepřijmete, tyto činnosti porušují autorská práva. Úpravou nebo šířením chráněného díla tedy vyjadřujete souhlas s Licencí a všem jejím ustanovením a podmínkám.
10. Automatické licencování následných příjemců
Po každé, když zveřejňujete chráněné dílo, získává příjemce od původního poskytovatele licence licenci pro spouštění, úpravu nebo šíření daného díla v souladu s ustanoveními této Licence. Nejste odpovědný za dodržování této Licence třetími stranami.
“Přenos entity” je přenos kontroly nad organizací, nebo v podstatě přenos všech jejích aktiv, nebo rozdělení organizace, nebo spojení organizací. Pokud šíření chráněného díla vyplývá z přenosu entity, každá strana transakce, která obdrží kopii díla, také obdrží všechny licence k dílu, které jeho předchůdce měl, nebo mohl dávat podle předchozího odstavce, plus obdrží právo na vlastnění Úplného zdroje díla od předchůdce, pokud ho předchůdce vlastní nebo jej může pořídit opodstatněným úsilím.
Nesmíte klást žádné překážky výkonu zaručených práv příjemce vyplývajících z této Licence. Například, nesmíte požadovat žádné licenční poplatky nebo jiné poplatky za výkon práv udělených touto Licencí a nesmíte zahájit soudní spor (včetně příčných- a proti-pohledávek v soudním sporu) vycházeje z toho, že tvorbou, používáním, prodejem, nabídnutím k prodeji, nebo dovážením Programu nebo jakékoli jeho části si nečiníte patentového nároku.
11. Patenty
“Přispěvatel” je držitel autorských práv, který touto Licencí autorizuje použití Programu nebo díla na Programu založeném. Takto licencované dílo se nazývá “verze přispěvatele”.
Přispěvatelovými “základními patentovými nároky” jsou všechny vlastněné patentové nároky nebo patentové nároky kontrolované přispěvatelem (již nabyté nebo později získané), které by tvorbou, používáním nebo prodáváním verze přispěvatele byly nějakým způsobem (povoleným touto Licencí) porušovány, ale nezahrnuje nároky, které by byly porušeny jen následkem dalších úprav verze přispěvatele. Pro potřeby této definice, “kontrolovat” znamená i právo udělit patentové sublicence způsobem konzistentním s požadavky této Licence.
Každý přispěvatel vám uděluje neexkluzivní, celosvětovou, bezplatnou patentovou licenci podle přispěvatelových základních patentových nároků k tvorbě, používání, předávání, poskytnutí k prodeji, dovážení a jinak, spouštění, úpravě a šíření obsahu verze přispěvatele.
V dalších třech odstavcích se “patentovou licencí” myslí jakýkoli výslovný souhlas nebo závazek nepožadovat patent (výslovné povolení užívání patentu nebo smlouva o nežalování za porušení patentu). “Udělit” takovou patentovou licenci nějaké straně znamená, buď takový výslovný souhlas dát, nebo závazek nevymáhat patent vůči dotyčné straně.
Pokud vědomě zveřejníte chráněné dílo, které podléhá patentové licenci a Úplný zdroj není zadarmo a podle podmínek této Licence není nikomu přístupný na kopírování přes veřejně přístupný síťový server, nebo jinak jednoduše zpřístupněný, pak musíte (1) takovým způsobem Úplný zdroj zpřístupnit, nebo (2) se sami o výhodu patentové licence pro toto konkrétní dílo připravit, nebo (3) zajistit, způsobem konzistentním s požadavky této Licence, aby se patentová licence přenášela na následné příjemce. “Vědomě” znamená, že máte skutečnou znalost o tom, že vaše zveřejnění chráněného díla v zemi nebo, že použití vašeho chráněného díla příjemcem, by porušilo jedno nebo více identifikovatelných patentů země, o kterých máte důvod se domnívat, že jsou platné.
Pokud budete zveřejňovat, nebo šířit chráněné dílo prostřednictvím pořízení jeho zveřejnění na základě jedné transakce nebo dohody a udělíte patentovou licenci jedné ze stran, které chráněné dílo přijímá a udělujete tak povolení k používání, šíření, uchování nebo zveřejnění konkrétního exempláře chráněného díla, pak patentová licence se automaticky rozšiřuje na všechny příjemce chráněného díla a na díla na něm založené.
Patentová licence je “diskriminační”, pokud do oblasti své působnosti zahrnuje zákazy výkonu, nebo je podmíněna zákazem výkonu jedné nebo více práv, která jsou touto Licencí uděleny. Chráněné dílo nemůžete zveřejňovat, pokud jste uzavřeli s třetí stranou, která se zabývá obchodní distribucí softwaru, dohodu, podle níž platíte třetí straně na základě rozsahu vašeho úsilí ve zveřejňování díla a podle níž třetí strana uděluje jakékoli straně, která by přijala chráněné dílo od vás, diskriminační patentovou licenci (a) v souvislosti s kopiemi chráněného díla zveřejněného vámi (nebo kopiemi vyrobenými z těchto kopií), nebo (b) především v souvislosti s konkrétním produktem nebo kompilací, která obsahuje chráněné dílo. To vše, pokud jste tuto dohodu uzavřely, nebo byla patentová licence udělena před 28. březnem 2007.
Nic z této Licence by nemělo být vykládáno jako navádění k porušování nebo omezování patentů či jiných vlastnických práv, které by se na vás jinak vztahovali podle platného patentového práva.
12. Neexistuje výjimka na úkor svobody ostatních
Pokud jsou vám uloženy takové podmínky (ať již rozhodnutím soudu, smlouvou nebo jinak), které se vylučují s podmínkami této Licence, nejste tím osvobozeni od podmínek této Licence. Pokud nemůžete šířit chráněné dílo tak, abyste vyhověl zároveň svým závazkům vyplývajícím z této Licence a jiným platným závazkům, nesmíte jej v důsledku toho šířit vůbec. Pokud byste například souhlasili s podmínkami, které by vám neumožňovaly další bezplatné zveřejňování všem, komu Program zveřejňujete, pak by jediný možný způsob, jak vyhovět daným podmínkám a zároveň i této Licenci spočíval v ukončení distribuce Programu.
13. Použití s Obecnou veřejnou licencí GNU Affero
Bez ohledu na jakákoli jiná ustanovení této Licence, máte povolení k propojení či kombinování jakéhokoliv chráněného díla s dílem licencovaným podle 3. verze Obecné veřejné licence GNU Affero do jediného kombinovaného díla a výsledné dílo zveřejnit. Podmínky této Licence se budou nadále vztahovat na část, která je chráněným dílem, ale, pokud jde o interakci prostřednictvím sítě, na kombinované dílo jako takové budou platit zvláštní požadavky odstavce 13 Obecné veřejné licence GNU Affero.
14. Revidovaná verze této Licence
Free Software Foundation může čas od času vydávat upravené a/nebo nové verze Obecné veřejné licence GNU. Nové verze se budou svým duchem podobat současné verzi, ale v některých detailech se kvůli řešení nových problémů či zájmů mohou lišit.
Každé verzi je přiděleno jednoznačné číslo verze. Pokud Program určí číslo verze, vztahuje se na něj daná verze Obecné veřejné licence GNU nebo kterákoli “později vydaná verze”, a můžete se podle uvážení řídit ustanoveními a podmínkami této konkrétní verze, nebo kterékoli pozdější verze vydanou Free Software Foundation. Jestliže program nespecifikuje číslo verze, můžete si vybrat libovolnou verzi, kterou Free Software Foundation vydala.
Pokud Program určí, že proxy-server může rozhodnout, která z budoucích verzí Obecné veřejné licence GNU může být použita, veřejné oznámení přijetí některé verze proxy-serverem vás trvale autorizuje vybrat si pro Program tu danou verzi.
Později vydané verze licence vám mohou zaručit dodatečné nebo pozměněné oprávnění. Avšak v důsledku vašeho výběru řídit se novější verzí se na žádného autora nebo držitele autorských práv neukládají žádné další závazky.

17. Výklad odstavců 15 a 16
Pokud výše uvedené zřeknutí se záruk a omezení odpovědnosti nemohou být s ohledem na své podmínky místo-právně vykonatelné, příslušný soud by měl vycházet z místních zákonů, které se nejvíce přibližují zbavení veškeré občanskoprávní odpovědnosti v souvislosti s Programem, pokud není záruka nebo převzetí odpovědnosti doprovázena zpoplatněním kopií Programu.
KONEC USTANOVENÍ A PODMÍNEK
Jak uplatnit tato ustanovení na vaše nové programy
Pokud vyvinete nový program a chcete, aby byl veřejnosti co nejvíce k užitku, nejlépe to dosáhnete tím, že jej prohlásíte za svobodný software, který může kdokoliv šířit a měnit za podmínek zde uvedených.
Pokud se tak rozhodnete, připojte k programu následující údaje. Nejbezpečnějším způsobem je připojit údaje na začátek každého souboru se zdrojovým kódem, čímž se nejúčinněji poukáže na vyloučení záruky. V každém souboru by pak měla být přinejmenším řádka s podpisem autora a odkazem na místo, kde lze získat ostatní úplné údaje.
<jeden řádek se jménem programu a krátkým popisem toho, co dělá>
Copyright (C) <rok> <jméno autora>
Tento program je svobodný software: můžete jej šířit a upravovat podle ustanovení Obecné veřejné licence GNU (GNU General Public Licence), vydávané Free Software Foundation a to buď podle 3. verze této Licence, nebo (podle vašeho uvážení) kterékoli pozdější verze.
Tento program je rozšiřován v naději, že bude užitečný, avšak BEZ JAKÉKOLIV ZÁRUKY. Neposkytují se ani odvozené záruky PRODEJNOSTI anebo VHODNOSTI PRO URČITÝ ÚČEL. Další podrobnosti hledejte v Obecné veřejné licenci GNU.
Kopii Obecné veřejné licence GNU jste měli obdržet spolu s tímto programem. Pokud se tak nestalo, najdete ji zde: <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Připojte rovněž informaci o tom, jakým způsobem je možné se s vámi spojit – elektronickou poštou nebo dopisem.
Pokud je program interaktivní, zařiďte, aby se při startu v interaktivním módu vypsalo hlášení podobné tomuto:
<program> Copyright (C) <rok> <jméno autora>
Tento program je ABSOLUTNĚ BEZ ZÁRUKY; podrobnosti se dozvíte zadáním ’show w’.
Jde o svobodný software a jeho šíření je za určitých podmínek vítáno; podrobnosti získáte zadáním ’show c’.
Hypotetické povely ’show w’ a ’show c’ by měly zobrazit příslušné pasáže Obecné veřejné licence. Samozřejmě, odpovídající příkazy nemusí být právě tyto, v grafickém uživatelském prostředí (GUI) to může být např. část “O nás” nebo “O programu”.
Pokud je to nutné, měli byste u svého zaměstnavatele (jestliže pracujete jako programátor) nebo představitele vaší školy (pokud nějakou navštěvujete) zařídit, aby podepsal “zřeknutí se autorských práv” k Programu. Více informací o tom, jak to udělat a zároveň neporušit GNU GPL, najdete na http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
Obecná veřejná licence GNU neumožňuje zahrnutí vašeho programu do programů, které nepodléhají Licenci. Pokud je váš program knihovnou podprogramů, můžete považovat za užitečnější povolit pouze navázání jiných aplikací (nepodléhajících této Licenci) na tuto knihovnu. Pokud tak chcete udělat, místo této Licence použijte Obecnou veřejnou licenci GNU Lesser. Ale ještě před tím si, prosím, přečtěte: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                            Preamble
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  0. Definitions.
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
  1. Source Code.
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.
  2. Basic Permissions.
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
  7. Additional Terms.
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
  8. Termination.
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
  11. Patents.
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  16. Limitation of Liability.
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

Es ist jedermann gestattet, diese Lizenzurkunde zu vervielfältigen und unveränderte Kopien zu verbreiten; Änderungen sind jedoch nicht erlaubt.
Diese Übersetzung ist kein rechtskräftiger Ersatz für die englischsprachige Originalversion!
Vorwort
Die GNU General Public License – die Allgemeine Öffentliche GNU-Lizenz – ist eine freie Copyleft-Lizenz für Software und andere Arten von Werken.
Die meisten Lizenzen für Software und andere nutzbaren Werke sind daraufhin entworfen worden, Ihnen die Freiheit zu nehmen, die Werke mit anderen zu teilen und zu verändern. Im Gegensatz dazu soll Ihnen die GNU General Public License die Freiheit garantieren, alle Versionen eines Programms zu teilen und zu verändern. Sie soll sicherstellen, daß die Software für alle ihre Benutzer frei bleibt. Wir, die Free Software Foundation, nutzen die GNU General Public License für den größten Teil unserer Software; sie gilt außerdem für jedes andere Werk, dessen Autoren es auf diese Weise freigegeben haben. Auch Sie können diese Lizenz auf Ihre Programme anwenden.
Wenn wir von freier Software sprechen, so beziehen wir uns auf Freiheit, nicht auf den Preis. Unsere Allgemeinen Öffentlichen Lizenzen sind darauf angelegt, sicherzustellen, daß Sie die Freiheit haben, Kopien freier Software zu verbreiten (und dafür etwas zu berechnen, wenn Sie möchten), die Möglichkeit, daß Sie die Software als Quelltext erhalten oder den Quelltext auf Wunsch bekommen, daß Sie die Software ändern oder Teile davon in neuen freien Programmen verwenden dürfen und daß Sie wissen, daß Sie dies alles tun dürfen.
Um Ihre Rechte zu schützen, müssen wir andere daran hindern, Ihnen diese Rechte zu verweigern oder Sie aufzufordern, auf diese Rechte zu verzichten. Aus diesem Grunde tragen Sie eine Verantwortung, wenn Sie Kopien der Software verbreiten oder die Software verändern: die Verantwortung, die Freiheit anderer zu respektieren.
Wenn Sie beispielsweise die Kopien eines solchen Programms verbreiten – kostenlos oder gegen Bezahlung – müssen Sie an die Empfänger dieselben Freiheiten weitergeben, die Sie selbst erhalten haben. Sie müssen sicherstellen, daß auch die Empfänger die Software im Quelltext erhalten bzw. den Quelltext erhalten können. Und Sie müssen ihnen diese Bedingungen zeigen, damit sie ihre Rechte kennen.
Software-Entwickler, die die GNU GPL nutzen, schützen Ihre Rechte in zwei Schritten: (1) Sie machen ihr Urheberrecht (Copyright) auf die Software geltend, und (2) sie bieten Ihnen diese Lizenz an, die Ihnen das Recht gibt, die Software zu vervielfältigen, zu verbreiten und/oder zu verändern.
Um die Entwickler und Autoren zu schützen, stellt die GPL darüberhinaus klar, daß für diese freie Software keinerlei Garantie besteht. Um sowohl der Anwender als auch der Autoren Willen erfordert die GPL, daß modifizierte Versionen der Software als solche gekennzeichnet werden, damit Probleme mit der modifizierten Software nicht fälschlicherweise mit den Autoren der Originalversion in Verbindung gebracht werden.
Manche Geräte sind daraufhin entworfen worden, ihren Anwendern zu verweigern, modifizierte Versionen der darauf laufenden Software zu installieren oder laufen zu lassen, wohingegen der Hersteller diese Möglichkeit hat. Dies ist grundsätzlich unvereinbar mit dem Ziel, die Freiheit der Anwender zu schützen, die Software zu modifizieren. Derartige gezielte mißbräuchliche Verhaltensmuster finden auf dem Gebiet persönlicher Gebrauchsgegenstände statt – also genau dort, wo sie am wenigsten akzeptabel sind. Aus diesem Grunde wurde diese Version der GPL daraufhin entworfen, diese Praxis für diese Produkte zu verbieten. Sollten derartige Probleme substantiell auf anderen Gebieten auftauchen, sind wir bereit, diese Regelung auf diese Gebiete auszudehnen, soweit dies notwendig ist, um die Freiheit der Benutzer zu schützen.
Schließlich und endlich ist jedes Computerprogramm permanent durch Software-Patente bedroht. Staaten sollten es nicht zulassen, daß Patente die Entwicklung und Anwendung von Software für allgemein einsetzbare Computer einschränken, aber in Staaten, wo dies geschieht, wollen wir die spezielle Gefahr vermeiden, daß Patente dazu verwendet werden, ein freies Programm im Endeffekt proprietär zu machen. Um dies zu verhindern, stellt die GPL sicher, daß Patente nicht verwendet werden können, um das Programm nicht-frei zu machen.
Es folgen die präzisen Bedingungen für das Kopieren, Verbreiten und Modifizieren.
LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN
0. Definitionen
„Diese Lizenz“ bezieht sich auf die Version 3 der GNU General Public License.
Mit „Urheberrecht“ sind auch urheberrechtähnliche Rechte gemeint, die auf andere Arten von Werken Anwendung finden, beispielsweise auf Fotomasken in der Halbleitertechnologie.
„Das Programm“ bezeichnet jedes urheberrechtlich schützbare Werk, das unter diese Lizenz gestellt wurde. Jeder Lizenznehmer wird als „Sie“ angeredet. „Lizenznehmer“ und „Empfänger“ können natürliche oder rechtliche Personen sein.
Ein Werk zu „modifizieren“ bedeutet, aus einem Werk zu kopieren oder es ganz oder teilweise auf eine Weise umzuarbeiten, die eine urheberrechtliche Erlaubnis erfordert und kein Eins-zu-eins-Kopieren darstellt. Das daraus hervorgehende Werk wird als „modifizierte Version“ des früheren Werks oder als auf dem früheren Werk „basierendes“ Werk bezeichnet.
Ein „betroffenes Werk“ bezeichnet entweder das unmodifizierte Programm oder ein auf dem Programm basierendes Werk.
Ein Werk zu „propagieren“ bezeichnet jedwede Handlung mit dem Werk, für die man, wenn unerlaubt begangen, wegen Verletzung anwendbaren Urheberrechts direkt oder indirekt zur Verantwortung gezogen würde, ausgenommen das Ausführen auf einem Computer oder das Modifizieren einer privaten Kopie. Unter das Propagieren eines Werks fallen Kopieren, Weitergeben (mit oder ohne Modifikationen), öffentliches Zugänglichmachen und in manchen Staaten noch weitere Tätigkeiten.
Ein Werk zu „übertragen“ bezeichnet jede Art von Propagation, die es Dritten ermöglicht, das Werk zu kopieren oder Kopien zu erhalten. Reine Interaktion mit einem Benutzer über ein Computer-Netzwerk ohne Übergabe einer Kopie ist keine Übertragung.
Eine interaktive Benutzerschnittstelle zeigt „angemessene rechtliche Hinweise“ in dem Umfang, daß sie eine zweckdienliches und deutlich sichtbare Funktion bereitstellt, die (1) einen angemessenen Copyright-Vermerk zeigt und (2) dem Benutzer mitteilt, daß keine Garantie für das Werk besteht (ausgenommen in dem Umfang, in dem Garantie gewährt wird), daß Lizenznehmer das Werk gemäß dieser Lizenz übertragen dürfen und wie man ein Exemplar dieser Lizenz zu Gesicht bekommen kann. Wenn die Benutzerschnittstelle eine Liste von Benutzerkommandos oder Optionen anzeigt, zum Beispiel ein Menü, dann erfüllt ein deutlich sichtbarer Punkt in dieser Liste dieses Kriterium.
1. Quelltext
Der „Quelltext“ eines Werkes bezeichnet diejenige Form des Werkes, die für Bearbeitungen vorzugsweise verwendet wird. „Objekt-Code“ bezeichnet jede Nicht-Quelltext-Form eines Werks.
Eine „Standardschnittstelle“ bezeichnet eine Schnittstelle, die entweder ein offizieller Standard eines anerkannten Standardisierungsgremiums ist oder – im Falle von Schnittstellen, die für eine spezielle Programmiersprache spezifiziert wurden – eine Schnittstelle, die unter Entwicklern, die in dieser Programmiersprache arbeiten, weithin gebräuchlich ist.
Die „Systembibliotheken“ eines ausführbaren Werks enthalten alles, ausgenommen das Werk als Ganzes, was (a) normalerweise zum Lieferumfang einer Hauptkomponente gehört, aber selbst nicht die Hauptkomponente ist, und (b) ausschließlich dazu dient, das Werk zusammen mit der Hauptkomponente benutzen zu können oder eine Standardschnittstelle zu implementieren, für die eine Implementation als Quelltext öffentlich erhältlich ist. Eine „Hauptkomponente“ bezeichnet in diesem Zusammenhang eine größere wesentliche Komponente (Betriebssystemkern, Fenstersystem usw.) des spezifischen Betriebssystems (soweit vorhanden), auf dem das ausführbare Werk läuft, oder des Compilers, der zur Erzeugung des Objekt-Codes eingesetzt wurde, oder des für die Ausführung verwendeten Objekt-Code-Interpreters.
Der „korrespondierende Quelltext“ eines Werks in Form von Objekt-Code bezeichnet den vollständigen Quelltext, der benötigt wird, um das Werk zu erzeugen, es zu installieren, um (im Falle eines ausführbaren Werks) den Objekt-Code auszuführen und um das Werk zu modifizieren, einschließlich der Skripte zur Steuerung dieser Aktivitäten. Er schließt jedoch nicht die Systembibliotheken, allgemein einsetzbare Werkzeuge oder allgemein erhältliche freie Computerprogramme mit ein, die in unmodifizierter Form verwendet werden, um die o.a. Tätigkeiten durchzuführen, die aber nicht Teil des Werks sind. Zum Beispiel enthält der korrespondierende Quelltext die zum Programmquelltext gehörenden Schnittstellendefinitionsdateien sowie die Quelltexte von dynamisch eingebundenen Bibliotheken und Unterprogrammen, auf die das Werk konstruktionsbedingt angewiesen ist, beispielsweise durch komplexe Datenkommunikation oder Ablaufsteuerung zwischen diesen Unterprogrammen und anderen Teilen des Werks.
Der korrespondierende Quelltext braucht nichts zu enthalten, das der Anwender aus anderen Teilen des korrespondierenden Quelltextes automatisch regenerieren kann.
Der korrespondierende Quelltext eines Werks in Quelltextform ist das Werk selbst.
2. Grundlegende Genehmigungen
Alle unter dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte werden gewährt auf Grundlage des Urheberrechts an dem Programm, und sie sind unwiderruflich, solange die festgelegten Bedingungen erfüllt sind. Diese Lizenz erklärt ausdrücklich Ihr uneingeschränktes Recht zur Ausführung des unmodifizierten Programms. Die beim Ausführen eines betroffenen Werks erzeugten Ausgabedaten fallen unter diese Lizenz nur dann, wenn sie, in Anbetracht ihres Inhalts, ein betroffenes Werk darstellen. Diese Lizenz erkennt Ihr im Urheberrecht vorgesehenes Recht auf angemessene Benutzung – oder seine Entsprechung – an.
Sie dürfen betroffene Werke, die Sie nicht übertragen, uneingeschränkt erzeugen, ausführen und propagieren, solange Ihre Lizenz ansonsten in Kraft bleibt. Sie dürfen betroffene Werke an Dritte übertragen für den einzigen Zweck, Modifikationen exklusiv für Sie durchzuführen oder Einrichtungen für Sie bereitzustellen, um diese Werke auszuführen, vorausgesetzt, Sie erfüllen alle Bedingungen dieser Lizenz für das Übertragen von Material, dessen Urheberrecht nicht bei Ihnen liegt. Diejenigen, die auf diese Weise betroffene Werke für Sie anfertigen oder ausführen, müssen dies ausschließlich in Ihrem Namen tun, unter Ihrer Anleitung und Kontrolle und unter Bedingungen, die ihnen verbieten, außerhalb ihrer Beziehung zu Ihnen weitere Kopien Ihres urheberrechtlich geschützten Materials anzufertigen.
Übertragung ist in jedem Fall ausschließlich unter den unten aufgeführten Bedingungen gestattet. Unterlizensierung ist nicht gestattet, ist aber wegen §10 unnötig.
3. Schutz von Anwenderrechten vor Umgehungsverbotgesetzen
Kein betroffenes Werk darf als Teil eines wirksamen technischen Mechanismus' unter jedwedem anwendbarem Recht betrachtet werden, das die Auflagen von Artikel 11 des am 20. Dezember 1996 verabschiedeten WIPO-Urheberrechtsvertrags oder unter vergleichbaren Gesetzen, die die Umgehung derartiger Mechanismen verbietet oder einschränkt.
Wenn Sie ein betroffenes Werk übertragen, verzichten Sie auf jedes Recht, die Umgehung technischer Mechanismen zu verbieten, insoweit diese Umgehung durch die Ausübung der von dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte in bezug auf das betroffene Werk herbeigeführt wird, und Sie weisen jede Absicht von sich, die Benutzung oder Modifikation des Werks zu beschränken, um Ihre Rechtsansprüche oder Rechtsansprüche Dritter zum Verbot der Umgehung technischer Mechanismen gegen die Anwender des Werks durchzusetzen.
4. Unveränderte Kopien
Sie dürfen auf beliebigen Medien unveränderte Kopien des Quelltextes des Programms, wie sie ihn erhalten, übertragen, sofern Sie auf deutliche und angemessene Weise auf jeder Kopie einen angemessenen Urheberrechts-Vermerk veröffentlichen, alle Hinweise intakt lassen, daß diese Lizenz und sämtliche gemäß §7 hinzugefügten Einschränkungen auf den Quelltext anwendbar sind, alle Hinweise auf das Nichtvorhandensein einer Garantie intakt lassen und allen Empfängern gemeinsam mit dem Programm ein Exemplar dieser Lizenz zukommen lassen.
Sie dürfen für jede übertragene Kopie ein Entgelt – oder auch kein Entgelt – verlangen, und Sie dürfen Kundendienst- oder Garantieleistungen gegen Entgelt anbieten.
5. Übertragung modifizierter Quelltextversionen
Sie dürfen ein auf dem Programm basierendes Werk oder die nötigen Modifikationen, um es aus dem Programm zu generieren, kopieren und übertragen in Form von Quelltext unter den Bestimmungen von §4, vorausgesetzt, daß Sie zusätzlich alle im folgenden genannten Bedingungen erfüllen:
a)	Das veränderte Werk muß auffällige Vermerke tragen, die besagen, daß Sie es modifiziert haben, und die ein darauf bezogenes Datum angeben.
b)	Das veränderte Werk muß auffällige Vermerke tragen, die besagen, daß es unter dieser Lizenz einschließlich der gemäß §7 hinzugefügten Bedingungen herausgegeben wird. Diese Anforderung wandelt die Anforderung aus §4 ab, „alle Hinweise intakt zu lassen“.
c)	Sie müssen das Gesamtwerk als Ganzes gemäß dieser Lizenz an jeden lizensieren, der in den Besitz einer Kopie gelangt. Diese Lizenz wird daher – ggf. einschließlich zusätzlicher Bedingungen gemäß §7 – für das Werk als Ganzes und alle seine Teile gelten, unabhängig davon, wie diese zusammengepackt werden. Diese Lizenz erteilt keine Erlaubnis, das Werk in irgendeiner anderen Weise zu lizensieren, setzt aber eine derartige Erlaubnis nicht außer Kraft, wenn Sie sie diese gesondert erhalten haben.
d)	Wenn das Werk über interaktive Benutzerschnittstellen verfügt, müssen diese jeweils angemessene rechtliche Hinweise anzeigen. Wenn allerdings das Programm interaktive Benutzerschnittstellen hat, die keine angemessenen rechtlichen Hinweise anzeigen, braucht Ihr Werk nicht dafür zu sorgen, daß sie dies tun.
Die Zusammenstellung eines betroffenen Werks mit anderen gesonderten und unabhängigen Werken, die nicht ihrer Natur nach Erweiterungen des betroffenen Werks sind und die nicht mit ihm in einer Weise kombiniert sind, um ein größeres Programm zu bilden, in oder auf einem Speicher- oder Verbreitungsmedium wird als „Aggregat“ bezeichnet, wenn die Zusammenstellung und das sich für sie ergebende Urheberrecht nicht dazu verwendet werden, den Zugriff oder die Rechte der Benutzer der Zusammenstellung weiter einzuschränken, als dies die einzelnen Werke erlauben. Die Aufnahme des betroffenen Werks in ein Aggregat sorgt nicht dafür, daß diese Lizenz auf die anderen Teile des Aggregats wirke.
6. Übertragung in Nicht-Quelltext-Form
Sie dürfen ein betroffenes Werk in Form von Objekt-Code unter den Bedingungen der Paragraphen 4 und 5 kopieren und übertragen – vorausgesetzt, daß Sie außerdem den maschinenlesbaren korrespondierenden Quelltext unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz übertragen auf eine der folgenden Weisen:
a)	Sie übertragen den Objekt-Code in einem physikalischen Produkt (einschließlich ein physikalisches Speichermedium) gemeinsam mit dem korrespondierenden Quelltext, der sich unveränderlich auf einem haltbaren physikalischen Medium befindet, das üblicherweise für den Austausch von Software verwendet wird.
b)	Sie übertragen den Objekt-Code in einem physikalischen Produkt (einschließlich ein physikalisches Speichermedium) gemeinsam mit einem schriftlichen Angebot, das mindestens drei Jahre lang gültig sein muß und so lange, wie Sie Ersatzteile und Kundendienst für dieses Produktmodell anbieten, jedem, der im Besitz des Objekt-Codes ist, entweder (1) eine Kopie des korrespondierenden Quelltextes der gesamten Software, die in dem Produkt enthalten und von dieser Lizenz betroffen ist, zur Verfügung zu stellen – auf einem haltbaren physikalischen Medium, das üblicherweise für den Austausch von Software verwendet wird, und zu nicht höheren Kosten als denen, die begründbar durch den physikalischen Vorgang der Übertragung des Quelltextes anfallen, oder (2) kostenlosen Zugriff, um den korrespondierenden Quelltext von einem Netzwerk-Server zu kopieren.
c)	Sie übertragen Kopien des Objekt-Codes gemeinsam mit einer Kopie des schriftlichen Angebots, den korrespondierenden Quelltext zur Verfügung zu stellen. Diese Alternative ist nur für gelegentliche, nicht-kommerzielle Übertragung zulässig und nur, wenn Sie den Objekt-Code als mit einem entsprechenden Angebot gemäß Absatz 6b erhalten haben.
d)	
Sie übertragen den Objekt-Code dadurch, daß Sie Zugriff auf eine dafür vorgesehene Stelle gewähren, und bieten gleichwertigen Zugriff auf den korrespondierenden Quelltext auf gleichem Weg auf dieselbe Stelle und ohne zusätzliche Kosten. Sie müssen nicht von den Empfängern verlangen, den korrespondierenden Quelltext gemeinsam mit dem Objekt-Code zu kopieren. Wenn es sich bei der für das Kopieren vorgesehenen Stelle um einen Netzwerk-Server handelt, darf sich der korrespondierende Quelltext auf einem anderen Server befinden (von Ihnen oder von einem Dritten betrieben), der gleichwertige Kopiermöglichkeiten unterstützt – vorausgesetzt Sie legen dem Objekt-Code klare Anleitungen bei, die besagen, wo der korrespondierende Quelltext zu finden ist. Unabhängig davon, welcher Netzwerk-Server den korrespondierenden Quelltext beherbergt, bleiben Sie verpflichtet, sicherzustellen, daß dieser lange genug bereitgestellt wird, um diesen Bedingungen zu genügen.
e)	Sie übertragen den Objekt-Code unter Verwendung von Peer-To-Peer-Übertragung – vorausgesetzt, Sie informieren andere Teilnehmer darüber, wo der Objekt-Code und der korrespondierende Quelltext des Werks unter den Bedingungen von Absatz 6d öffentlich und kostenfrei angeboten werden.
Ein abtrennbarer Anteil des Objekt-Codes, dessen Quelltext von dem korrespondierenden Quelltext als Systembibliothek ausgeschlossen ist, braucht bei der Übertragung des Werks als Objekt-Code nicht miteinbezogen zu werden.
Ein „Benutzerprodukt“ ist entweder (1) ein „Endbenutzerprodukt“, womit ein materieller persönlicher Besitz gemeint ist, der normalerweise für den persönlichen oder familiären Gebrauch oder im Haushalt eingesetzt wird, oder (2) alles, was für den Einbau in eine Wohnung hin entworfen oder dafür verkauft wird. Bei der Entscheidung, ob ein Produkt ein Endbenutzerprodukt ist, sollen Zweifelsfälle als erfaßt gelten. Wenn ein spezieller Anwender ein spezielles Produkt erhält, bezeichnet „normalerweise einsetzen“ eine typische oder weitverbreitete Anwendung dieser Produktklasse, unabhängig vom Status des speziellen Anwenders oder der Art und Weise, wie der spezielle Anwender des spezielle Produkt tatsächlich einsetzt oder wie von ihm erwartet wird, daß er es einsetzt. Ein Produkt gilt als Endbenutzerprodukt unabhängig davon, ob es substantiellen kommerziellen, industriellen oder nicht-endbenutzerspezifischen Nutzen hat, es sei denn, dieser Nutzen stellt das einzige signifikante Anwendungsgebiet des Produkts dar.
Mit „Installationsinformationen“ für ein Benutzerprodukt sind jedwede Methoden, Prozeduren, Berechtigungsschlüssel oder andere informationen gemeint, die notwendig sind, um modifizierte Versionen eines betroffenen Werks, die aus einer modifizierten Version seines korrespondierenden Quelltextes hervorgegangen sind, auf dem Produkt zu installieren und auszuführen. Die Informationen müssen ausreichen, um sicherzustellen, daß das Weiterfunktionieren des modifizierten Objekt-Codes in keinem Fall verhindert oder gestört wird aus dem einzigen Grunde, weil Modifikationen vorgenommen worden sind.
Wenn Sie Objekt-Code gemäß diesem Paragraphen innerhalb oder zusammen mit oder speziell für den Gebrauch innerhalb eines Benutzerprodukts übertragen und die Übertragung als Teil einer Transaktion stattfindet, in der das Recht auf den Besitz und die Benutzung des Benutzerprodukts dauerhaft auf den Empfänger übergeht (unabhängig davon, wie diese Transaktion charakterisiert ist), müssen dem gemäß diesem Paragraphen mitübertragenen korrespondierenden Quelltext die Installationsinformationen beiliegen. Diese Anforderung gilt jedoch nicht, wenn weder Sie noch irgendeine Drittpartei die Möglichkeit behält, modifizierten Objekt-Code auf dem Benutzerprodukt zu installieren (zum Beispiel, wenn das Werk in einem ROM installiert wurde).
Die Anforderung, Installationsinformationen bereitzustellen, schließt keine Anforderung mit ein, weiterhin Kundendienst, Garantie oder Updates für ein Werk bereitzustellen, das vom Empfänger modifiziert oder installiert worden ist, oder für das Benutzerprodukt, in dem das Werk modifiziert oder installiert worden ist. Der Zugriff auf ein Computer-Netzwerk darf verweigert werden, wenn die Modifikation selbst die Funktion des Netzwerks grundlegend nachteilig beeinflußt oder wenn sie die Regeln und Protokolle für die Kommunikation über das Netzwerk verletzt.
Der korrespondierende Quelltext und die Installationsinformationen, die in Übereinstimmung mit diesem Paragraphen übertragen werden, müssen in einem öffentlich dokumentierten Format vorliegen (für das eine Implementation in Form von Quelltext öffentlich zugänglich ist), und sie dürfen keine speziellen Passwörter oder Schlüssel für das Auspacken, Lesen oder Kopieren erfordern.
7. Zusätzliche Bedingungen
„Zusätzliche Genehmigungen“ sind Bedingungen, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz ergänzen, indem sie Ausnahmen von einer oder mehreren Auflagen zulassen. Zusätzliche Genehmigungen zur Anwendung auf das gesamte Programm sollen so betrachtet werden, als wären sie in dieser Lizenz enthalten, soweit dies unter anwendbarem Recht zulässig ist. Wenn zusätzliche Genehmigungen nur für einen Teil des Programms gelten, darf dieser Teil separat unter diesen Genehmigungen verwendet werden; das gesamte Programm jedoch unterliegt weiterhin dieser Lizenz ohne Beachtung der zusätzlichen Genehmigungen.
Wenn Sie eine Kopie eines betroffenen Werks übertragen, dürfen Sie, wenn Sie es wünschen, jegliche zusätzliche Genehmigungen von dieser Kopie oder jedem Teil der Kopie entfernen. (Zusätzliche Genehmigungen dürfen so verfaßt sein, daß sie in bestimmten Fällen, wenn Sie das Werk modifizieren, entfernt werden müssen.) Sie dürfen Material, das Sie einem betroffenen Werk hinzufügen und für das Sie das Urheberrecht besitzen oder in entsprechender Form gewähren dürfen, mit zusätzlichen Genehmigungen ausstatten.
Ungeachtet jeglicher anderer Regelungen dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie für Material, das Sie einem betroffenen Werk hinzufügen (sofern Sie durch die Urheberrechtsinhaber dieses Materials autorisiert sind), die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz um folgendes ergänzen:
a)	Gewährleistungsausschluß oder Haftungsbegrenzung abweichend von §§15 und 16 dieser Lizenz oder
b)	die Anforderung, spezifizierte sinnvolle rechtliche Hinweise oder Autorenschaftshinweise in diesem Material oder in den angemessenen rechtlichen Hinweisen, die von den sie enthaltenen Werken angezeigt werden, zu erhalten, oder
c)	das Verbot, die Herkunft des Materials falsch darzustellen oder die Anforderung, daß modifizierte Versionen des Materials auf angemessens Weise als vom Original verschieden markiert werden, oder
d)	Begrenzung der Verwendung der Namen von Lizenzgebern oder Autoren des Materials für Werbezwecke oder
e)	das Zurückweisen der Einräumung von Rechten gemäß dem Markenrecht zur Benutzung gewisser Produktnamen, Produkt- oder Service-Marken oder
f)	die Erfordernis der Freistellung des Lizenznehmers und der Autoren des Materials durch jeden, der die Software (oder modifizierte Versionen davon) überträgt, mit vertraglichen Prämissen der Verantwortung gegenüber dem Empfänger für jede Verantwortung, die diese vertraglichen Prämissen diesen Lizenzgebern und Autoren direkt auferlegen.
Alle anderen hinzugefügten einschränkenden Bedingungen werden als „zusätzliche Einschränkungen“ im Sinne von §10 betrachtet. Wenn das Programm, wie Sie es erhalten haben, oder ein Teil davon dieser Lizenz untersteht zuzüglich einer weiteren Bedingung, die eine zusätzliche Einschränkung darstellt, dürfen Sie diese Bedingung entfernen. Wenn ein Lizenzdokument eine zusätzliche Einschränkung enthält, aber die Relizensierung unter dieser Lizenz erlaubt, dürfen Sie dem betroffenen Werk Material hinzufügen, das den Bedingungen jenes Lizenzdokuments unterliegt, unter der Voraussetzung, daß die zusätzlichen Einschränkungen bei einer derartigen Relizensierung oder Übertragung verfallen.
Wenn Sie einem betroffenen Werk in Übereinstimmung mit diesem Paragraphen Bedingungen hinzufügen, müssen Sie in den betroffenen Quelltextdateien eine Aufstellung der zusätzlichen Bedingungen plazieren, die auf diese Quelltextdatei Anwendung finden, oder einen Hinweis darauf, wo die Zusätzlichen Bedingungen zu finden sind.
Zusätzliche Bedingungen, seien es Genehmigungen oder Einschränkungen, dürfen in Form einer separaten schriftlichen Lizenz oder in Form von Ausnahmen festgelegt werden; die o.a. Anforderungen gelten in jedem Fall.
8. Kündigung
Sie dürfen das Programm nicht verbreiten oder modifizieren, sofern es nicht durch diese Lizenz ausdrücklich gestattet ist. Jeder anderweitige Versuch der Verbreitung oder Modifizierung ist nichtig und beendet automatisch Ihre Rechte unter dieser Lizenz (einschließlich aller Patentlizenzen gemäß §11 Abs. 3).
Wenn Sie jedoch alle Verletzungen dieser Lizenz beenden, wird Ihre Lizenz durch einen speziellen Urheberrechtsinhaber wiederhergestellt, und zwar (a) vorübergehend, solange nicht bzw. bis der Rechteinhaber Ihre Lizenz ausdrücklich und endgültig kündigt, und (b) dauerhaft, sofern es der Rechteinhaber versäumt, Sie auf sinnvolle Weise auf die Lizenzverletzung innerhalb von 60 Tagen ab deren Beendigung hinzuweisen.
Darüberhinaus wird Ihre Lizenz durch einen speziellen Urheberrechtsinhaber permanent wiederhergestellt, wenn Sie der Rechteinhaber auf sinnvolle Weise auf die Verletzung hinweist, wenn außerdem dies das erste Mal ist, daß Sie auf die Verletzung dieser Lizenz (für jedes Werk) des Rechteinhabers hingewiesen werden, und wenn Sie die Verletzung innerhalb von 30 Tagen ab dem Eingang des Hinweises einstellen.
Die Beendigung Ihrer Rechte unter dieser Lizenz beendet nicht die Lizenzen Dritter, die von Ihnen Kopien oder Rechte unter dieser Lizenz erhalten haben. Wenn Ihre Rechte beendet und nicht dauerhaft wiederhergestellt worden sind, sind Sie nicht berechtigt, neue Lizenzen für dasselbe Material gemäß §10 zu erhalten.
9. Annahme der Lizenz keine Voraussetzung für den Besitz von Kopien
Um eine Kopie des Programms auszuführen, ist es nicht erforderlich, daß Sie diese Lizenz annehmen. Die nebenbei stattfindende Verbreitung eines betroffenen Werks, die sich ausschließlich als Konsequenz der Teilnahme an einer Peer-To-Peer-Datenübertragung ergibt, um eine Kopie entgegennehmen zu können, erfordert ebenfalls keine Annahme dieser Lizenz. Jedoch gibt Ihnen nichts außer dieser Lizenz die Erlaubnis, das Programm oder jedes betroffene Werk zu verbreiten oder zu verändern. Diese Handlungen verstoßen gegen das Urheberrecht, wenn Sie diese Lizenz nicht anerkennen. Indem Sie daher ein betroffenes Werk verändern oder propagieren, erklären Sie Ihr Einverständnis mit dieser Lizenz, die Ihnen diese Tätigkeiten erlaubt.
10. Automatische Lizensierung nachgeordneter Anwender
Jedesmal, wenn Sie ein betroffenes Werk übertragen, erhält der Empfänger automatisch vom ursprünglichen Lizenzgeber die Lizenz, das Werk auszuführen, zu verändern und zu propagieren – in Übereinstimmung mit dieser Lizenz. Sie sind nicht dafür verantwortlich, die Einhaltung dieser Lizenz durch Dritte durchzusetzen.
Eine „Organisations-Transaktion“ ist entweder eine Transaktion, bei der die Kontrolle über eine Organisation oder das im wesentlichen gesamte Kapital einer solchen, übertragen wird, oder sie ist die Aufteilung einer Organisation in mehrere oder die Fusion mehrerer Organisationen zu einer. Wenn die Propagation eines betroffenen Werks durch eine Organisations-Transaktion erfolgt, erhält jeder an der Transaktion Beteiligte, der eine Kopie des Werks erhält, zugleich jedwede Lizenz an dem Werk, die der Interessenvorgänger des Beteiligten hatte, sowie das Recht auf den Besitz des korrespondierenden Quelltextes des Werks vom Interessenvorgänger, wenn dieser ihn hat oder mit vertretbarem Aufwand beschaffen kann.
Sie dürfen keine zusätzlichen Einschränkungen bzgl. der Ausübung der unter dieser Lizenz gewährten oder zugesicherten Rechte vornehmen. Beispielsweise dürfen Sie keine Lizenzgebühr oder sonstige Gebühr für die Ausübung der unter dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte verlangen, und Sie dürfen keine Rechtsstreitigkeit beginnen (eingeschlossen Kreuz- oder Gegenansprüche in einem Gerichtsverfahren), in der Sie unterstellen, daß irgendein Patentanspruch durch Erzeugung, Anwendung, Verkauf, Verkaufsangebot oder Import des Programms oder irgendeines Teils davon verletzt wurde.
11. Patente
Ein „Kontributor“ ist ein Urheberrechtsinhaber, der die Benutzung des Programms oder eines auf dem Programm basierenden Werks unter dieser Lizenz erlaubt. Das auf diese Weise lizensierte Werk bezeichnen wir als die „Kontributor-Version“ des Kontributors.
Die „wesentlichen Patentansprüche“ eines Kontributors sind all diejenigen Patentansprüche, die der Kontributor besitzt oder kontrolliert, ob bereits erworben oder erst in Zukunft zu erwerben, die durch irgendeine Weise des gemäß dieser Lizenz erlaubten Erzeugens, Ausführens oder Verkaufens seiner Kontributor-Version verletzt würden. Dies schließt keine Patentansprüche ein, die erst als Konsequenz weiterer Modifizierung seiner Kontributor-Version entstünden. Für den Zweck dieser Definition schließt "Kontrolle" das Recht mit ein, Unterlizenzen für ein Patent zu erteilen auf eine Weise, die mit den Erfordernissen dieser Lizenz vereinbar ist.
Jeder Kontributor gewährt Ihnen eine nicht-exklusive, weltweite und gebührenfreie Patentlizenz gemäß den wesentlichen Patentansprüchen des Kontributors, den Inhalt seiner Kontributor-Version zu erzeugen, zu verkaufen, zum Verkauf anzubieten, zu importieren und außerdem auszuführen, zu modifizieren und zu propagieren.
In den folgenden drei Absätzen ist eine „Patentlizenz“ jedwede ausdrückliche Vereinbarung oder Verpflichtung, wie auch immer benannt, ein Patent nicht geltend zu machen (beispielsweise eine ausdrückliche Erlaubnis, ein Patent zu nutzen oder eine Zusicherung, bei Patentverletzung nicht zu klagen). Jemandem eine solche Patentlizenz zu „erteilen“ bedeutet, eine solche Vereinbarung oder Verpflichtung zu beschließen, ein Patent nicht gegen ihn durchzusetzen.
Wenn Sie ein betroffenes Werk übertragen, das wissentlich auf eine Patentlizenz angewiesen ist, und wenn der korrespondierende Quelltext nicht für jeden zum Kopieren zur Verfügung gestellt wird – kostenlos, unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz und über einen öffentlich zugänglichen Netzwerk-Server oder andere leicht zugängliche Mittel –, dann müssen Sie entweder (1) dafür sorgen, daß der korrespondierende Quelltext auf diese Weise verfügbar gemacht wird oder (2) dafür sorgen, daß Ihnen selbst die Vorteile der Patentlizenz für dieses spezielle Werk entzogen werden oder (3) in einer mit den Erfordernissen dieser Lizenz vereinbaren Weise bewirken, daß die Patentlizenz auf nachgeordnete Empfänger ausgedehnt wird. „Wissentlich angewiesen sein“ bedeutet, daß Sie tatsächliches Wissen darüber haben, daß – außer wegen der Patentlizenz – Ihre Übertragung des betroffenen Werks in einen Staat oder die Benutzung des betroffenen Werks durch Ihren Empfänger in einem Staat, eins oder mehrere identifizierbare Patente in diesem Staat verletzen würden, deren Gültigkeit Ihnen glaubhaft erscheint.
Wenn Sie, als Folge von oder in Verbindung mit einer einzelnen Transaktion oder Vereinbarung, ein betroffenes Werk übertragen oder durch Vermittlung einer Übertragung propagieren, und Sie gewähren einigen Empfängern eine Patentlizenz, die ihnen das Benutzen, Propagieren, Modifizieren und Übertragen einer speziellen Kopie des betroffenen Werks gestatten, dann wird die von Ihnen gewährte Patentlizenz automatisch auf alle Empfänger des betroffenen Werks und darauf basierender Werke ausgedehnt.
Eine Patentlizenz ist „diskriminierend“, wenn sie in ihrem Gültigkeitsbereich die speziell unter dieser Lizenz gewährten Rechte nicht einschließt, wenn sie die Ausübung dieser Rechte verbietet oder wenn sie die Nichtausübung einer oder mehrerer dieser Rechte zur Bedingung hat. Sie dürfen ein betroffenes Werk nicht übertragen, wenn Sie Partner in einem Vertrag mit einer Drittpartei sind, die auf dem Gebiet der Verbreitung von Software geschäftlich tätig ist, gemäß dem Sie dieser Drittpartei Zahlungen leisten, die auf dem Maß Ihrer Aktivität des Übertragens des Werks basieren, und gemäß dem die Drittpartei eine diskriminierende Patentlizenz all denjenigen gewährt, die das Werk von Ihnen erhielten, (a) in Verbindung mit von Ihnen übertragenen Kopien des betroffenen Werks (oder Kopien dieser Kopien) oder (b) hauptsächlich für und in Verbindung mit spezifischen Produkten oder Zusammenstellungen, die das betroffene Werk enthalten, es sei denn, Sie sind in diesen Vertrag vor dem 28. März 2007 eingetreten oder die Patentlizenz wurde vor diesem Datum erteilt.
Nichts in dieser Lizenz soll in einer Weise ausgelegt werden, die irgendeine implizite Lizenz oder sonstige Abwehr gegen Rechtsverletzung ausschließt oder begrenzt, die Ihnen ansonsten gemäß anwendbarem Patentrecht zustünde.
12. Keine Preisgabe der Freiheit Dritter
Sollten Ihnen (durch Gerichtsbeschluß, Vergleich oder anderweitig) Bedingungen auferlegt werden, die den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz widersprechen, so befreien Sie diese Umstände nicht von den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz. Wenn es Ihnen nicht möglich ist, ein betroffenes Werk unter gleichzeitiger Beachtung der Bedingungen in dieser Lizenz und Ihrer anderweitigen Verpflichtungen zu übertragen, dann dürfen Sie als Folge das Programm überhaupt nicht übertragen. Wenn Sie zum Beispiel Bedingungen akzeptieren, die Sie dazu verpflichten, von denen, denen Sie das Programm übertragen haben, eine Gebühr für die weitere Übertragung einzufordern, dann besteht der einzige Weg, sowohl jene Bedingungen als auch diese Lizenz zu befolgen darin, ganz auf die Übertragung des Programms zu verzichten.
13. Nutzung zusammen mit der GNU Affero General Public License
Ungeachtet anderer Regelungen dieser Lizenz, ist es Ihnen gestattet, ein betroffenes Werk mit einem Werk zu einem einzelnen, kombinierten Werk zu verbinden (linken) oder zu kombinieren, das unter Version 3 der GNU Affero General Public License steht, und das Ergebnis zu übertragen. Die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz bleiben weiterhin auf denjenigen Teil anwendbar, der das betroffene Werk darstellt, aber die speziellen Anforderungen der GNU Affero General Public License, §13, die sich auf Interaktion über ein Computer-Netzwerk beziehen, werden auf die Kombination als solche anwendbar.
14. Überarbeitungen dieser Lizenz
Die Free Software Foundation kann von Zeit zu Zeit überarbeitete und/oder neue Versionen der General Public License veröffentlichen. Solche neuen Versionen werden vom Grundprinzip her der gegenwärtigen entsprechen, können aber im Detail abweichen, um neuen Problemen und Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.
Jede Version dieser Lizenz hat eine eindeutige Versionsnummer. Wenn in einem Programm angegeben wird, daß es dieser Lizenz in einer bestimmten Versionsnummer „oder jeder späteren Version“ (“or any later version”) unterliegt, so haben Sie die Wahl, entweder den Bestimmungen der genannten Version zu folgen oder denen jeder beliebigen späteren Version, die von der Free Software Foundation veröffentlicht wurde. Wenn das Programm keine Versionsnummer angibt, können Sie eine beliebige Version wählen, die je von der Free Software Foundation veröffentlicht wurde.
15. Gewährleistungsausschluß
Es besteht keinerlei Gewährleistung für das Programm, soweit dies gesetzlich zulässig ist. Sofern nicht anderweitig schriftlich bestätigt, stellen die Urheberrechtsinhaber und/oder Dritte das Programm so zur Verfügung, „wie es ist“, ohne irgendeine Gewährleistung, weder ausdrücklich noch implizit, einschließlich – aber nicht begrenzt auf – die implizite Gewährleistung der Marktreife oder der Verwendbarkeit für einen bestimmten Zweck. Das volle Risiko bezüglich Qualität und Leistungsfähigkeit des Programms liegt bei Ihnen. Sollte sich das Programm als fehlerhaft herausstellen, liegen die Kosten für notwendigen Service, Reparatur oder Korrektur bei Ihnen.
16. Haftungsbegrenzung
In keinem Fall, außer wenn durch geltendes Recht gefordert oder schriftlich zugesichert, ist irgendein Urheberrechtsinhaber oder irgendein Dritter, der das Programm wie oben erlaubt modifiziert oder übertragen hat, Ihnen gegenüber für irgendwelche Schäden haftbar, einschließlich jeglicher allgemeiner oder spezieller Schäden, Schäden durch Seiteneffekte (Nebenwirkungen) oder Folgeschäden, die aus der Benutzung des Programms oder der Unbenutzbarkeit des Programms folgen (einschließlich – aber nicht beschränkt auf – Datenverluste, fehlerhafte Verarbeitung von Daten, Verluste, die von Ihnen oder anderen getragen werden müssen, oder dem Unvermögen des Programms, mit irgendeinem anderen Programm zusammenzuarbeiten), selbst wenn ein Urheberrechtsinhaber oder Dritter über die Möglichkeit solcher Schäden unterrichtet worden war.
17. Interpretation von §§ 15 und 16
Sollten der o.a. Gewährleistungsausschluß und die o.a. Haftungsbegrenzung aufgrund ihrer Bedingungen gemäß lokalem Recht unwirksam sein, sollen Bewertungsgerichte dasjenige lokale Recht anwenden, das einer absoluten Aufhebung jeglicher zivilen Haftung in Zusammenhang mit dem Programm am nächsten kommt, es sei denn, dem Programm lag eine entgeltliche Garantieerklärung oder Haftungsübernahme bei.
ENDE DER LIZENZBEDINGUNGEN
Wie Sie diese Bedingungen auf Ihre eigenen, neuen Programme anwenden können
Wenn Sie ein neues Programm entwickeln und wollen, daß es vom größtmöglichen Nutzen für die Allgemeinheit ist, dann erreichen Sie das am besten, indem Sie es zu freier Software machen, die jeder unter diesen Bestimmungen weiterverbreiten und verändern kann.
Um dies zu erreichen, fügen Sie die folgenden Vermerke zu Ihrem Programm hinzu. Am sichersten ist es, sie an den Anfang einer jeden Quelldatei zu stellen, um den Gewährleistungsausschluß möglichst deutlich darzustellen; zumindest aber sollte jede Datei die „Copyright“-Zeile besitzen sowie einen kurzen Hinweis darauf, wo die vollständigen Vermerke zu finden sind.

GNU General Public License (GPL)
3. változat, 2007. június 29.
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
A jelen licencdokumentumot bárki szabadon lemásolhatja és a pontos másolatait terjesztheti, de a módosítása tilos.
Előszó
A GNU GPL egy szabad, „copyleft” típusú [a szerzői jog egy részét fenntartó, más részéről lemondó] licenc szoftverekhez és más munkákhoz.
A legtöbb szoftver licencei azzal a szándékkal készültek, hogy minél kevesebb lehetőséget adjanak a szoftver megváltoztatására és terjesztésére. Ezzel szemben a GNU GPL célja, hogy garantálja a szabad szoftver másolásának és terjesztésének szabadságát, ezáltal biztosítva a szoftver szabad felhasználhatóságát minden felhasználó számára. A GPL szabályai vonatkoznak a Free Software Foundation legtöbb szoftverére, illetve minden olyan programra, melynek szerzője úgy dönt, hogy ezt használja a szerzői jog megjelölésekor. (A Free Software Foundation egyes szoftvereire a GNU LGPL érvényes.) Bárki használhatja a programjaiban a GPL-t a szerzői jogi megjegyzésnél.
A szabad szoftver megjelölés nem azt jelenti, hogy a szoftvernek nem lehet ára. A GPL licencek célja, hogy garantálja a szabad szoftver másolatainak szabad terjesztését (és e szolgáltatásért akár díj felszámítását), a forráskód elérhetőségét, hogy bárki szabadon módosíthassa a szoftvert, vagy felhasználhassa a részeit új szabad programokban; és hogy mások megismerhessék ezt a lehetőséget.
A szerző jogainak védelmében korlátozásokat kell hozni, amelyek megtiltják, hogy bárki megtagadhassa ezeket a jogokat másoktól, vagy bárki mást ezekről való lemondásra kényszerítsen. 
Ezek a megszorítások bizonyos felelősségeket jelentenek azok számára, akik a szoftver másolatait terjesztik vagy módosítják.
Ha valaki például ilyen program másolatait terjeszti, akár ingyen vagy bizonyos összeg fejében, a szoftverre vonatkozó minden jogot tovább kell adnia a fogadó feleknek. Biztosítani kell továbbá, hogy megkapják vagy legalábbis megkaphassák a forráskódot is, valamint jelen dokumentumban lévő a licencfeltételeket is el kell juttatni hozzájuk, hogy tisztában legyenek a jogaikkal.
A GNU GPL-t használó fejlesztők két lépésben védik az Ön jogait:
(1) a szoftver szerzői jogainak védelmével és
(2) a jelen licenc biztosításával, amely jogalapot biztosít a szoftver másolására, terjesztésére és/vagy módosítására.
Az egyes fejlesztők és szerzők védelmében a GPL világosan kimondja, hogy az általa licencelt szabad szoftverre nincs jótállás. A GPL – a felhasználók és a szerzők érdekében egyaránt – megköveteli, hogy a módosított verziókon a változások meg legyenek jelölve, hogy az esetleges problémákat ne róhassák fel – tévesen – a korábbi változatot készítőnek.
Egyes eszközök úgy készültek, hogy ne tegyék lehetővé a felhasználóknak a bennük található szoftver módosított változatainak telepítését vagy futtatását, miközben a gyártó képes erre. Ez alapjaiban nem fér össze azon célunkkal, hogy védjük a felhasználóknak a szoftver módosítására vonatkozó szabadságát. Az ilyen visszaélések legkövetkezetesebb módon az egyének által használható termékeknél fordulnak elő, ahol ez a legelfogadhatatlanabb. Éppen ezért a GPL jelen verzióját kifejezetten úgy készítettük, hogy tiltsa az ilyen termékek gyakorlatát. Amennyiben lényeges mértékben más területeken is előfordulnak hasonló problémák, úgy készen állunk, hogy ezt a rendelkezést kiterjesszük a GPL jövőbeni verzióiban azokra a területekre is, hogy védjük a felhasználók szabadságát.
Végül, a szabad szoftver létét állandóan fenyegetik a szoftverszabadalmak. Az államoknak általában nem szabadna engedniük, hogy szabadalmakat jegyezhessenek be az általános célú számítógépekhez való szoftverek fejlesztésének és használatának korlátozására, azonban azokban az országokban, ahol lehetőség van az ilyen szabadalmak bejegyzésére, el szeretnénk kerülni a valós veszélyt a szabad programok oly módon történő átalakításának, hogy saját szellemi tulajdont képezzenek belőle. Ennek megelőzéséhez a jelen GPL rögzíti, hogy szabadalmak nem használhatók a program nem szabaddá tételére. 
A másolásra, terjesztésre, módosításra vonatkozó pontos szabályok és feltételek:
FELTÉTELEK ÉS KIKÖTÉSEK
0. Meghatározások
A "jelen Licenc" a GNU General Public License 3. változatát jelenti.
"Szerzői jog" alatt értünk minden, a szerzői joghoz hasonló törvényt, amely vonatkozhat másfajta munkákra, például félvezetők maszkjaira is.
"Program" minden olyan, szerzői joggal védhető munka, amely a jelen Licenccel kerül licencelésre. Minden licencet kapóra úgy hivatkozunk, hogy "Ön". A "licencet kapók" és a "fogadók" lehetnek egyének és szervezetek egyaránt.
Egy adott munka "módosítása" azt jelenti, hogy egy változatlan példány készítése helyett egy részét vagy egészét lemásolják vagy adaptálják oly módon, amihez szerzői jogi engedély szükséges. Az eredményül kapott munka a korábbi munka "módosított változata", vagy olyan munka, amelyik a korábbi munkán "alapul".
A "Lefedett munka" vagy a nem módosított Programot jelenti, vagy a Programon alapuló munkát.
Egy munka "terjesztése" olyan cselekvést jelent, amely engedély hiányában közvetlenül vagy másodlagosan felelőssé tenne az alkalmazható szerzői jogi törvények megsértéséért, kivéve közülük a számítógépen történő végrehajtást vagy egy magánpéldány módosítását. Terjesztés tehát a másolás, a szétosztás (módosítással vagy anélkül), a közzététel és egyes országokban még további tevékenységek is.
Egy munka "továbbadása" bármilyen olyan fajta terjesztést jelent, amelynek eredményeképp más felek példányokat állíthatnak elő vagy kaphatnak. Egy felhasználóval való kapcsolat egy számítógép-hálózaton keresztül, példány átvitele nélkül, nem számít továbbadásnak.
Egy interaktív felhasználói felületen akkor jelenik meg "Megfelelő jogi figyelmeztetés", ha kényelmesen és szembetűnően
(1) megjeleníti a megfelelő szerzői jogi figyelmeztetést és
(2) tudatosítja a felhasználóban, hogy nincs jótállás a munkára vonatkozóan (kivéve a biztosított jótállás mértékében),
hogy a licencet kapók csak a jelen Licenc keretében adhatják tovább a munkát, valamint azt, hogy milyen módon tekinthető meg a jelen Licenc. Ha a felületen megjelenik felhasználói parancsok vagy lehetőségek listája, például egy menü, akkor a lista egy szembetűnő eleme megfelel ennek a feltételnek.
1. Forráskód
Egy munka "forráskódja" a munka módosításhoz használt előnyben részesített formátum. A "tárgykód" a munka bármilyen, nem forráskódú formátuma.
A "Szabványos felület" vagy egy elismert szabványtestület által meghatározott hivatalos, szabványos felület, vagy egy adott programozási nyelv felületei esetén az adott nyelven dolgozó fejlesztők által széles körben használt felület.
Egy végrehajtható munka "Rendszerkönyvtára" lehet bármi, kivéve a munka egészét, ami
(a) szerepel a Fő komponens csomagolásának szokásos formájában, de amelyik nem az adott Fő komponens része és
(b) kizárólag azt a célt szolgálja, hogy lehetővé tegye az adott Fő komponens használatát, vagy egy Szabványos felületet valósítson meg, amely megvalósítás nyilvánosan elérhető mindenki számára, forráskód formátumban.
A "Fő komponens" ebben a szövegkörnyezetben a végrehajtható munka futtatásához használt operációs rendszer (ha van ilyen), a munka létrehozásához használt fordító, vagy a futtatásához használt tárgykód-értelmező egy fő, lényegi komponensét (kernel, ablakkezelő rendszer és hasonlók) jelenti.
Egy tárgykód formátumú munka "Vonatkozó forrása" az összes olyan forráskódot jelenti, amelyre szükség van a tárgykód előállításához, telepítéséhez, (végrehajtható munka esetén) a tárgykód futtatásához és a munka módosításához, beleértve az ilyen tevékenységeket vezérlő parancsfájlokat is. Nem tartalmazza azonban a munka Rendszerkönyvtárait, az általános célú eszközöket, vagy az általánosan elérhető szabad programokat, amelyeket nem módosított állapotban használnak e tevékenységek elvégzésére és amelyek nem képezik részét a munkának. Például a Vonatkozó forrás magában foglalja a munka forráskódfájljaihoz társított felületdefiníciós fájlokat, valamint az olyan megosztott programkönyvtárak és dinamikusan kapcsolt alprogramok forráskódját, amelyeket a munka kifejezetten igényel, például a bizalmas adatkommunikációhoz, vagy az alprogramok és a munka egyéb részei közötti folyamatvezérléshez.
A Vonatkozó forrásnak nem kell semmi olyat tartalmaznia, amit a felhasználók automatikusan újra elő tudnak állítani a Vonatkozó forrás egyéb részeiből.
A Vonatkozó forrás egy forráskód formátumú munka esetében a munka maga.
2. Alapvető jogosultságok
A jelen Licenc keretében megadott minden jog a Program szerzői jogának érvényességi idejére szól, és visszavonhatatlan, feltéve, hogy a leírt feltételek teljesülnek. A jelen Licenc kifejezetten kijelenti, hogy Ön korlátlanul jogosult futtatni a nem módosított Programot. A Lefedett munka futtatásából származó kimenetre csak akkor vonatkozik a jelen Licenc, ha a kimenet tartalmában szintén Lefedett munkát képvisel. A jelen Licenc elismeri az Ön jogait a szerzői jogi törvény által biztosított a szabad felhasználásra vagy azzal egyenértékű tevékenységre.
Ön korlátozás nélkül készíthet, futtathat és terjeszthet Lefedett munkákat, amelyet nem ad tovább, feltéve, hogy az Ön licence egyébként érvényben marad. Ön továbbadhat Lefedett munkákat másoknak azzal az egyetlen céllal, hogy módosításokat készítsenek kizárólag az Ön számára, vagy az Ön számára megteremtsék e munka futtatásának feltételeit, feltéve, hogy betartja a jelen Licenc feltételeit arra vonatkozóan, hogy továbbít minden anyagot, amelynek a szerzői jogait nem Ön szabályozza. Azok, akik így előállítanak vagy futtatnak Lefedett munkákat, azt kizárólag az Ön nevében, az Ön irányítása és felügyelete alatt tehetik, olyan feltételekkel, ami megtiltja számukra példányok készítését az Ön szerzői joggal védett anyagairól az Önnel való kapcsolaton kívül.
Bármilyen más körülmények között a továbbadás kizárólag az alábbiakban leírt módon történhet. A továbblicencelés nem engedélyezett; a 10. szakasz feleslegessé teszi.
3. A felhasználók törvényes jogainak védelme a megkerülésellenes törvénytől
Semmilyen Lefedett munka nem tekinthető hatékony műszaki megoldás részének semmilyen, az 1996. december 20-án elfogadott WIPO szerzői jogi egyezmény 11. cikkelyének követelményét kielégítő, alkalmazható jogszabály szerint, vagy más hasonló, az ilyen intézkedések megkerülését tiltó vagy korlátozó jogszabály szerint.
Egy Lefedett munka továbbadásakor Ön lemond minden jogáról, amellyel megtilthatná a műszaki megoldások megkerülését olyan mértékben, amennyiben az ilyen megkerülést befolyásolja a jelen Licencben a Lefedett munkára vonatkozóan megadott jogok gyakorlása, és lemond minden szándékáról, hogy módosítsa a munkát vagy korlátozza annak működését annak érdekében, hogy kikényszerítse a munka felhasználóit illetően az Ön vagy harmadik feleknek a műszaki megoldások megkerülésére vonatkozó jogait.
4. Pontosan megegyező példányok továbbadása
A Program változatlan forráskódja továbbadható abban a formában, amelyben megkapta, bármilyen adathordozón, feltéve, hogy minden egyes példányon pontosan szerepel a megfelelő szerzői jogi megjegyzés; érintetlenül kell hagyni minden figyelmeztetést, amely arról szól, hogy a kódra a jelen Licenc és a 7. szakaszban található nem engedélyező feltételek vonatkoznak; érintetlenül kell hagyni a garancia teljes hiányára utaló szöveget; valamint a jelen licencdokumentumot is el kell juttatni mindazokhoz, akik a Programot kapják.
Bármekkora díj felszámítható a másolat fizikai továbbadása fejében (de nem kötelező), illetve díjazás fejében a Programhoz támogatás vagy garanciális védelem is biztosítható.
5. Módosított forrású változatok továbbítása
Továbbíthatja a Programon alapuló munkákat, vagy a Programból létrehozásukhoz szükséges módosításokat forráskód formájában a 4. szakasz rendelkezéseinek megfelelően, amennyiben az alábbi feltételeket is teljesíti:
a) A munkának szembetűnő figyelmeztetést kell tartalmaznia arról, hogy módosított, és a módosítás dátumáról.
b) A munkának jól látható figyelmeztetést kell tartalmaznia arról, hogy a jelen Licenc és a 7. szakaszban található feltételek vonatkoznak rá. Ez a követelmény módosítja a 4. szakasz „érintetlenül kell hagyni minden figyelmeztetést” követelményét.
c) A teljes munkát egészében a jelen Licenccel kell licencelni mindenki számára, aki akár csak egy példány birtokába is juthat. A jelen Licenc – és a 7. szakasz összes alkalmazható további feltétele – tehát érvényes lesz a munka egészére és összes részére, függetlenül attól, hogyan csomagolják. A jelen Licenc nem ad engedélyt a munka bármilyen egyéb módon történő licencelésére, de nem érvényteleníti az ilyen engedélyt, ha azt külön kapta.
d) Ha a munkának vannak interaktív felhasználói felületei, akkor mindegyiken meg kell jeleníteni a Megfelelő jogi figyelmeztetést; ha azonban a Programban vannak olyan interaktív felületek, amelyek nem jelenítik meg a Megfelelő jogi figyelmeztetést, akkor az Ön munkájának sem kell.
Egy Lefedett munka egy összeállításban szerepeltetése egy tárolóeszköz vagy terjesztési adathordozó egy kötetén más, különálló és független munkákkal, amelyek természetüknél fogva nem a Lefedett munka bővítményei és amelyek nincsenek egyesítve vele, "kapcsolt gyűjteménynek" tekintendő, ha az összeállítás és az eredményül kapott szerzői jogok nem használhatók arra, hogy korlátozzák az összeállítás felhasználóinak hozzáférését vagy törvényes jogait azon túl, amit az egyes munkák maguk engedélyeznek. Egy Lefedett munka szerepeltetése egy kapcsolt gyűjteményben nem jelenti azt, hogy a jelen Licenc a kapcsolt gyűjtemény más részeire is vonatkozik.
6. Nem forráskód formátum továbbadása
Egy Lefedett munka tárgykód formátumban is továbbadható a 4. és 5. szakaszok rendelkezéseinek megfelelően, feltéve, hogy továbbítja a géppel olvasható Vonatkozó forrást is a jelen Licenc keretében, az alábbi módok valamelyikén:
a) Továbbadja a tárgykódot fizikai termékként vagy abban megtestesítve (beleértve a fizikai terjesztési adathordozót), és vele együtt a Vonatkozó forrást rögzítetten, egy tartós, a szoftverterjesztéshez jellemzően használt fizikai adathordozón.
b) Továbbadja a tárgykódot fizikai termékként vagy abban megtestesítve (beleértve a fizikai terjesztési adathordozót), és mellé írásban vállalja, hogy legalább három évig, de addig, amíg tartalékalkatrészeket vagy vásárlói támogatást nyújt a termék adott modelljéhez, mindenképpen érvényes, bárkinek, aki rendelkezik a tárgykóddal, vagy
(1) biztosítja a Vonatkozó forrást a jelen Licenc által lefedett termék minden szoftverének egy tartós, a szoftvercseréhez jellemzően használt fizikai adathordozón, nem nagyobb összegért, mint az Önnek a forrás fizikai továbbításával kapcsolatos ésszerű költségei, vagy
(2) ingyenesen elérhetővé teszi a Vonatkozó forrást egy hálózati kiszolgálón lemásolás céljára.
c) Továbbadja a tárgykód egyedi példányait egy, a Vonatkozó forrás biztosításáról szóló írásos ajánlattal együtt. Ezt az alternatívát csak esetlegesen és nem kereskedelmi célból engedélyezett, és csak akkor, ha a tárgykódot egy ilyen ajánlattal együtt kapta, a 6b. szakasznak megfelelően.
d) Továbbadja a tárgykódot úgy, hogy hozzáférést biztosít egy meghatározott helyen (ingyenesen vagy díj ellenében), és ezzel egyenértékű hozzáférést biztosít a Vonatkozó forráshoz ugyanott, ugyanolyan módon, további díj felszámítása nélkül. Nem kell kötelezni a fogadó feleket arra, hogy a Vonatkozó forrást is lemásolják a tárgykóddal együtt. Ha a tárgykód másolására szolgáló hely egy hálózati kiszolgáló, akkor a Vonatkozó forrás lehet egy másik kiszolgálón (amelyet üzemeltethet Ön vagy egy harmadik fél), amely egyenértékű másolási lehetőségeket biztosít, feltéve, hogy Ön világos útmutatást ad a tárgykód mellett, hogy hol található a Vonatkozó forrás. Függetlenül attól, hogy mely kiszolgálón található a Vonatkozó forrás, az Ön kötelessége marad annak biztosítása, hogy az elérhető legyen mindaddig, amíg ezeknek a kötelezettségeknek eleget kell tennie.
e) Továbbadja a tárgykódot egyenrangú (peer-to-peer) átviteli megoldással, feltéve, hogy értesíti a többi egyenrangú felet, hogy a munka tárgykódja és Vonatkozó forrása a nyilvánosság számára ingyenesen biztosított, a 6d. szakasznak megfelelően.
A tárgykód olyan elválasztható részét, amelynek forráskódja ki van hagyva a Vonatkozó forrásból, mint Rendszerkönyvtár, nem kötelező együtt továbbadni a munka tárgykódjával.
"Felhasználói terméknek" tekintjük
(1) a "fogyasztói termékeket", ami minden olyan kézzelfogható személyes tulajdont jelent, amelyet normálisan személyes, családi vagy háztartási célokra használnak, illetve
(2) bármi olyat, amit lakásban történő felhasználásra terveztek vagy értékesítettek.
Annak eldöntésekor, hogy egy adott termék fogyasztói termék-e, a kétséges esetekben az elterjedés mértének javára kell dönteni. Egy adott felhasználó által megkapott egy adott termék esetében a "normál használat" a szokásos vagy általános használatát jelenti a termék kategóriájának megfelelően, függetlenül az adott felhasználó állapotától, vagy attól, hogy az adott felhasználó milyen módon használja a terméket, várja el vagy várják el tőle a termék használatát. Egy termék fogyasztói termék, függetlenül attól, hogy a terméknek van-e lényeges kereskedelmi, ipari vagy nem fogyasztói felhasználási módja, kivéve, ha az ilyenek a termék egyetlen lényeges használati módját jelentik.
Egy Felhasználói termék "Telepítési információi" magában foglalják az összes módszert, eljárást, feljogosítási kulcsot vagy egyéb információt, amely az adott Felhasználói termékben a Lefedett munka Vonatkozó forrásának egy módosított változatának telepítéséhez és futtatásához szükséges. Az információ elégséges kell, hogy legyen ahhoz, hogy a módosított tárgykód további működését semmilyen esetben sem akadályozza meg vagy hátráltassa csak azért, mert a módosítás megtörtént.
Ha a jelen szakaszban tárgyalt munka tárgykódját egy Felhasználói termékben, azzal együtt, vagy kifejezetten az abban történő felhasználásra kerül továbbadásra, és ez egy olyan ügylet keretében történik, amelynek során a Felhasználói termék birtokviszonya és használati joga örökre vagy egy meghatározott időre a fogadó fél tulajdonába kerül (függetlenül attól, hogy hogyan van jellemezve ez az ügylet), akkor a jelen szakasz értelmében továbbadott Vonatkozó forráshoz mellékelni kell a Telepítési információkat. Ez a kötelezettség nem érvényes, ha sem Ön, sem más harmadik fél nem képes arra, hogy a módosított tárgykódot telepítse a Felhasználói termékre (például a munka ROM-ba lett telepítve).
A Telepítési információk biztosításának kötelezettsége nem foglal magában kötelezettséget támogatási szolgáltatás, garancia vagy frissítések további biztosításához az olyan munkákhoz, amelyet a fogadó fél módosított vagy telepített, illetve az olyan Felhasználói termékekre, amelyben módosította vagy telepítette. A hálózati hozzáférés letiltható, ha a módosítás maga lényegesen és hátrányosan befolyásolja a hálózat működését, vagy megsérti a hálózati kommunikáció szabályait vagy protokolljait.
Az olyan munkákhoz, amelyet a fogadó fél módosított vagy telepített, illetve az olyan Felhasználói termékekre, amelyben módosította vagy telepítette, a Telepítési információk biztosításának kötelezettsége nem foglal magában kötelezettséget támogatási szolgáltatás, garancia vagy frissítések további biztosításához. A hálózati hozzáférés letiltható, ha a módosítás maga lényegesen és hátrányosan befolyásolja a hálózat működését, vagy megsérti a hálózati kommunikáció szabályait vagy protokolljait.
A továbbadott Vonatkozó források és a biztosított Telepítési információk a jelen szakasszal összhangban nyilvánosan dokumentált formátumban kell, hogy legyenek (és egy implementációnak a nyilvánosság rendelkezésére kell állnia forráskód formájában), és nem szabad, hogy speciális jelszót vagy kulcsot kérjen a kicsomagoláshoz, olvasáshoz vagy másoláshoz.
7. További feltételek
A "További engedélyek" az olyan feltételek, amelyek a jelen Licenc feltételeit egészítik ki úgy, hogy kivételeket tesznek egy vagy több feltétellel kapcsolatban. A teljes Programra alkalmazható További engedélyeket úgy tekintjük, mintha szerepelnének a jelen Licencben, az alkalmazható törvénynek megfelelő maximális mértékben. Ha a További engedélyek csak a Program egy részére vonatkoznak, úgy az a rész külön is használható azon engedélyeknek megfelelően, de a teljes Programra a jelen Licenc marad érvényes, a További engedélyektől függetlenül.
Egy Lefedett munka példányának továbbadásakor Ön saját belátása szerint eltávolíthat További engedélyeket az adott példányból, vagy annak bármely részéből. (A További engedélyek lehetnek úgy megírva, hogy megkövetelik a saját eltávolításukat, ha módosítja a munkát.) El is helyezhet További engedélyeket az Ön által a Lefedett munkához adott anyagokon, amelyekre vonatkozóan Ön rendelkezik a megfelelő szerzői jogi engedéllyel, vagy jogosult azt megadni.
A jelen Licenc többi rendelkezésének ellenére, az olyan anyagokra vonatkozóan, amelyeket Ön ad a Lefedett munkához, Ön (amennyiben az anyag szerzői jogának tulajdonosai ezt engedélyezik), kiegészítheti a jelen Licenc feltételeit az alábbiakkal:
a) a garancia elutasítása vagy a felelősség korlátozása a jelen Licenc 15. és 16. szakaszától eltérő módon; vagy
b) meghatározott jogi figyelmeztetések vagy szerzői megjelölések megőrzésének megkövetelése az anyagban, vagy az őket tartalmazó munka által megjelenített Megfelelő jogi figyelmeztetésben; vagy
c) az anyag eredetéről szóló hamis közlés megtiltása, vagy annak megkövetelése, hogy az ilyen anyagok módosított változatait ésszerű módon meg kelljen jelölni az eredeti változattól eltérőnek; vagy
d) annak korlátozása, hogy az anyag licencadóinak vagy szerzőinek nevét reklámként használják; vagy
e) a védjegytörvény hatálya alá eső jogok megadásának visszautasítása egyes márkanevek, védjegyek vagy szolgáltatási védjegyek használatával kapcsolatban; vagy
f) kártalanítás megkövetelése az anyag licencadói és szerzői számára mindazoktól, akik szerződésben foglalt felelősségvállalással továbbadják az anyagot (vagy annak módosított változatait), minden olyan szerződéses felelősségre vonatkozóan, amely közvetlenül érintheti a licencadókat és a szerzőket.
Minden egyéb, nem engedélyező további feltétel "további szigorításnak" tekintendő a 10. szakasz jelentésén belül. Ha a Program a megkapott formájában, vagy annak bármely része figyelmeztetést tartalmaz, amely kijelenti, hogy rá a jelen Licenc és egy további szigorító feltétel vonatkozik, akkor ezt a feltételt Ön eltávolíthatja. Ha a licencdokumentum további szigorítást tartalmaz, de engedi a továbblicencelést vagy továbbítást a jelen Licenc keretében, akkor Ön bővítheti az ilyen licencdokumentum feltételeivel szabályozott Lefedett munka anyagát, feltéve, hogy a további szigorítás nem marad érvényben a továbblicencelés vagy továbbítás után.
Ha egy Lefedett munka feltételeit bővíti a jelen szakasz előírásainak megfelelően, akkor el kell helyeznie a vonatkozó forrásfájlokban a fájlokra vonatkozó kiegészítő feltételeket, vagy egy figyelmeztetést, amely jelzi, hogy hol találhatók az alkalmazható feltételek.
A további feltételek, akár megengedők, akár nem engedélyezők, szerepelhetnek egy külön írott licenc formájában, vagy felsorolhatók kivételekként; a fenti követelmények mindkét esetben érvényesek.
8. Megszűnés
Ön kizárólag a jelen Licencben kifejezetten meghatározott módon jogosult terjeszteni és módosítani a Lefedett munkákat. Minden egyéb terjesztési vagy módosítási kísérlet érvénytelen és automatikusan megszünteti az Önnek a jelen Licenc keretében megadott jogait (beleértve a 11. szakasz harmadik bekezdésének megfelelően megadott szabadalmi licenceket is).
Ha azonban teljesen megszünteti a jelen Licenc megsértését, akkor az Önnek egy adott szerzőijog-tulajdonostól származó licence visszaállításra kerül
(a) ideiglenesen, hacsak és amíg a szerzőijog-tulajdonos kifejezetten és véglegesen meg nem szünteti az Ön licencét, vagy
(b) tartósan, ha a szerzőijog-tulajdonos nem értesíti Önt a jogsértésről valamilyen ésszerű módon a megszűnés után 60 nappal.
Ezenfelül, az Önnek egy adott szerzőijog-tulajdonostól származó licence véglegesen visszaállításra kerül, ha a szerzőijog-tulajdonos értesíti Önt a jogsértésről valamilyen ésszerű módon, ez az első alkalom, hogy a jelen Licenc megsértéséről (bármilyen munkával kapcsolatban) figyelmeztetést kapott az adott szerzőijog-tulajdonostól, és ha a jogsértéseket a figyelmeztetés kézhez kapása után 30 napon belül orvosolja.
Az Ön jogainak a jelen szakasz értelmében megszűnése nem jelenti azt, hogy azon felek licencei is megszűnnek, akik példányokat vagy jogokat kaptak Öntől a jelen Licenc keretében. Ha az Ön jogai megszűntek, és nem lettek véglegesen visszaállítva, akkor Ön nem jogosult új licenceket kapni ugyanarra az anyagra vonatkozóan a 10. szakasz szerint.
9. Nem kötelező az elfogadás a példányok birtoklásához
Önnek nem kötelező elfogadnia a jelen Licencet ahhoz, hogy megkapja vagy futtassa a Program egy példányát. Egy Lefedett munka mellékes terjesztése, amely kizárólag egyenrangú átvitel használatának következménye abból a célból, hogy megszerezzen egy példányt, szintén nem igényel elfogadást. A Lefedett munka terjesztését és módosítását azonban a jelen Licencen kívül semmi más nem engedélyezheti. Ezek a műveletek a szerzői jog megsértésének számítanak, ha nem fogadja el a jelen Licencet. Éppen ezért egy Lefedett munka módosításával vagy terjesztésével Ön jelzi, hogy elfogadta a jelen Licencet.
10. További fogadók automatikus licencelése
Egy Lefedett munka minden egyes továbbadásakor a fogadó fél automatikusan megkapja az eredeti licenctulajdonosoktól a licencet a munka futtatására, módosítására és terjesztésére, a jelen Licenc feltételei mellett. Ön nem felelős azért, hogy harmadik felek betartsák a jelen Licenc rendelkezéseit.
"Entitástranzakciónak" nevezzük az olyan tranzakciót, amely átadja egy szervezet vagy a szervezet összes vagyontárgyának az irányítását, illetve feloszt vagy összeolvaszt szervezeteket. Amennyiben egy Lefedett munka terjesztése Entitástranzakcióból származik, úgy a tranzakcióban résztvevő minden fél, amely kap a munkából egy példányt, megkapja az összes licencet is, amellyel a fél jogelődje az előző bekezdés értelmében rendelkezett vagy megadhatott, valamint a jogosultságot az érdekelt jogelőd munkájának Vonatkozó forrásának birtoklására, amennyiben a jogelőd azzal rendelkezik vagy ésszerű erőfeszítésekkel megszerezheti.
Ön nem tehet további szigorításokat a jelen Licenc keretében megadott vagy jóváhagyott jogok gyakorlására vonatkozóan. Például nem számíthat fel licencdíjat, jogdíjat, vagy egyéb díjakat a jelen Licencben megadott jogok gyakorlásáért, és nem indíthat keresetet (beleértve egy per ellen- vagy keresztkereseteit is) azt állítva, hogy bármilyen szabadalmi igénypont meg lett sértve a Program előállításával, használatával, értékesítésével, értékesítésre felkínálásával, illetve a Program vagy annak egy részének importálásával.
11. Szabadalmak
"Közreműködő" az a szerzőijog-tulajdonos, aki engedélyezi a jelen Licenc keretében a Program vagy egy olyan munka használatát, amelyen a Program alapul. Az így licencelt munka a közreműködő "közreműködői változata".
A közreműködő "alapvető szabadalmi igénypontjai" a közreműködő által birtokolt vagy szabályozott összes igénypont, akár azok, amelyek már a birtokában vannak, vagy azok, amelyeknek ezután jut a birtokába, és amelyet valamilyen módon megsértene a közreműködői változatnak a jelen Licenc alapján engedélyezett előállítása, használata vagy értékesítése. Nem tartoznak azonban ide az olyan igénypontok, amelyek megsértése csak a közreműködői változat további módosításának eredményeképpen állna elő. A jelen meghatározás céljaira a "szabályozás" alatt a szabadalom további licenceinek a jelen Licenc követelményeinek előírásaival összhangban megadásának jogát értjük.
Minden közreműködő egy nem kizárólagos, az egész világra kiterjedő, jogdíjmentes szabadalmi licencet biztosít Önnek az ő saját alapvető szabadalmi igénypontjaival kapcsolatban ahhoz, hogy Ön előállíthassa, felhasználhassa, értékesíthesse, értékesítésre felkínálhassa, importálhassa és egyéb módokon futtassa és terjeszthesse az ő közreműködői változatának tartalmát.
A következő három bekezdésben a "szabadalmi licenc" minden olyan kifejezett megállapodásra vagy elkötelezettségre vonatkozik elnevezésétől függetlenül, amely egy szabadalom nem érvényesítéséről szól (tehát például egy kifejezett engedély egy szabadalom alkalmazására, vagy egy szövetség a szabadalomsértések miatti perek elkerüléséről). Egy ilyen szabadalmi licenc "megadása" egy fél számára egy megállapodást vagy kötelezettségvállalást jelent arra nézve, hogy nem érvényesítenek a fél ellen szabadalmat.
Ha egy olyan Lefedett munkát ad tovább, amelyről tudott, hogy függ egy bizonyos szabadalmi licenctől és a munka Vonatkozó forrása nem érhető el mindenki számára ingyenesen, a jelen Licenc feltételeinek megfelelő lemásolásra egy nyilvánosan elérhető hálózati kiszolgálón vagy más, készen elérhető módon, akkor
(1) a Vonatkozó forrást elérhetővé kell tennie, vagy
(2) meg kell fosztania magát az adott munkára vonatkozóan a szabadalmi licenc előnyeitől, vagy
(3) meg kell szerveznie, a jelen Licenc követelményeivel összhangban, hogy kiterjessze a szabadalmi licencet a további fogadó felekre.
A "tudott, hogy függ" alatt azt értjük, hogy Ön ténylegesen tudja, hogy a szabadalmi licenc hiányában az a tény, hogy Ön továbbítja a Lefedett munkát az országban, vagy ha azok használják a Lefedett munkát az országban, akik Öntől kapják, egy vagy több azonosítható, Ön által jogosnak vélt érvényes szabadalmat sért az adott országban.
Ha egyetlen ügylet vagy megállapodás értelmében vagy azzal kapcsolatban Ön továbbadja vagy terjeszti a Lefedett munkát, és megadja a szabadalmi licencet a Lefedett munkát fogadó felek számára, továbbá engedélyezi számukra a Lefedett munka egy adott példányának használatát, terjesztését, módosítását vagy továbbadását, akkor a megadott szabadalmi licenc automatikusan kiterjesztésre kerül a Lefedett munka és a rajta alapuló összes munka minden fogadójára.
Egy szabadalmi licenc "megkülönböztető", ha a terjedelmében nem tartalmazza a jelen Licenc által kifejezetten megadott egy vagy több jogot, ha megtiltja azok gyakorlását, vagy feltétele az ilyen jogok legalább egyikének nem gyakorlása. Tilos a Lefedett munka továbbítása, ha Ön egy olyan megállapodásban résztvevő egyik fél egy szoftverterjesztéssel foglalkozó harmadik féllel együtt, amelynek keretében Ön fizet a harmadik fél számára a munka továbbításának tevékenysége alapján, és amelynek keretében a harmadik fél mindazon felek számára, akik Öntől megkapják a Lefedett munkát, egy megkülönböztető szabadalmi licencet ad
(a) a Lefedett munka Ön által továbbított példányaival (vagy az e példányokról készült másolatokkal) kapcsolatban, vagy
(b) elsődlegesen a Lefedett munkát tartalmazó meghatározott termékekre és összeállításokra vonatkozóan vagy azokkal kapcsolatban, kivéve, ha 2007. március 28. előtt kötötték a szerződést vagy kapta meg a szabadalmi licencet.
A jelen Licenc semmilyen része nem értelmezhető úgy, hogy kizárja vagy korlátozza bármely beleértett licencet vagy egyéb jogsértés elleni védelmet, amelyek egyébként az Ön rendelkezésére állnak az alkalmazható szabadalmi törvények értelmében.
12. Mások szabadsága nem adható fel
Ha bármilyen okból (akár bírósági határozat, akár megállapodás, akár bármi más eredményeképp) olyan feltételeknek kell megfelelnie, amelyek ellentétesek a jelen Licenc feltételeivel, az nem menti fel Önt a jelen feltételek figyelembe vétele alól. Ha egy Lefedett munka továbbítása nem lehetséges a jelen Licenc és az egyéb vonatkozó feltételek kötelezettségeinek együttes betartásával, akkor tilos a továbbadás. Ha például egy szabadalmi szerződés nem engedi meg egy program jogdíj nélküli továbbterjesztését azok számára, akik közvetve vagy közvetlenül megkapják, akkor az egyetlen módja, hogy eleget tegyen valaki mindkét feltételnek, az, hogy eláll a Program továbbadásától.
13. Együttes használat a GNU Affero General Public License-szel
A jelen Licenc bármely rendelkezésétől függetlenül Ön jogosult bármely Lefedett munkát egyetlen, egyesített munkává összeszerkeszteni vagy egyesíteni egy olyan munkával, amelyre a GNU Affero General Public License 3. változata érvényes, és azt továbbadni. A jelen Licenc feltételei továbbra is érvényesek maradnak arra a részre, ami a Lefedett munka, de a GNU Affero General Public License 13. szakaszának speciális, a hálózaton keresztüli interakcióra vonatkozó követelményei az egyesített munkára érvényesek.
14. A jelen Licenc felülvizsgált változatai
A Free Software Foundation időről időre kiadja a General Public License felülvizsgált és/vagy újabb változatait. Ezek az újabb dokumentumok az előzőek szellemében készülnek, de részletekben különbözhetnek, hogy új problémákat vagy aggályokat is kezeljenek.
A dokumentum minden változata egy megkülönböztető verziószámmal ellátva jelenik meg. Ha a program szerzői jogi megjegyzésében egy bizonyos, "vagy annál újabb" verzió van megjelölve, akkor lehetőség van akár a megjelölt, vagy a Free Software Foundation által kiadott későbbi verzióban leírt feltételek követésére. Ha nincs ilyen megjelölt verzió, akkor lehetőség van a Free Software Foundation által valaha kibocsátott bármelyik verzió alkalmazására.
Ha a Program azt írja elő, hogy egy meghatalmazott döntheti el, hogy a GNU General Public License melyik változatát lehessen használni, akkor az adott meghatalmazottnak egy adott verzióról szóló nyilvános átvételi nyilatkozata véglegesen meghatározza, hogy melyik verziót kell a Programhoz választani.
A későbbi licencváltozatokban előfordulhatnak további vagy eltérő engedélyek. Semmilyen szerzőre vagy szerzőijog-tulajdonosra nem mérhetők azonban további kötelezettségek amiatt, hogy Ön egy későbbi változatot választ.
15. Garanciavállalás hiánya
AZ ALKALMAZHATÓ JOGSZABÁLYOK ÁLTAL BIZTOSÍTOTT MAXIMÁLIS MÉRTÉKBEN VISSZAUTASÍTJUK A PROGRAMHOZ A GARANCIA BIZTOSÍTÁSÁT. AMENNYIBEN A SZERZŐI JOGOK TULAJDONOSAI ÍRÁSBAN MÁSKÉNT NEM NYILATKOZNAK, A PROGRAM A "JELEN ÁLLAPOTÁBAN" KERÜL KIADÁSRA, MINDENFÉLE GARANCIAVÁLLALÁS NÉLKÜL, LEGYEN AZ KIFEJEZETT VAGY BELEÉRTETT, BELEÉRTVE, DE NEM KIZÁRÓLAGOSAN A FORGALOMBA HOZHATÓSÁGRA VAGY ALKALMAZHATÓSÁGRA VONATKOZÓ GARANCIÁKAT. A PROGRAM MINŐSÉGÉBŐL ÉS MŰKÖDÉSÉBŐL FAKADÓ ÖSSZES KOCKÁZAT A FELHASZNÁLÓT TERHELI. HA A PROGRAM HIBÁSAN MŰKÖDIK, A FELHASZNÁLÓNAK MAGÁNAK KELL VÁLLALNIA A JAVÍTÁSHOZ SZÜKSÉGES MINDEN KÖLTSÉGET.
16. Felelősség korlátozása
A HATÁLYOS JOGSZABÁLYOK ELŐÍRÁSAIT VAGY AZ ÍRÁSOS MEGÁLLAPODÁST KIVÉVE, A SZERZŐI JOGOK SEMELYIK TULAJDONOSA, SEM MÁSOK AKIK MÓDOSÍTOTTÁK ÉS/VAGY TERJESZTETTÉK A PROGRAMOT A FENTIEKNEK MEGFELELŐEN, NEM TEHETŐK FELELŐSSÉ A KÁROKÉRT, BELEÉRTVE MINDEN ÁLTALÁNOS, SPECIÁLIS, VÉLETLEN, VAGY KÖVETKEZMÉNYES KÁRT, AMELY A PROGRAM HASZNÁLATÁBÓL VAGY A HASZNÁLAT MEGAKADÁLYOZÁSÁBÓL SZÁRMAZIK (BELEÉRTVE, DE NEM KIZÁRÓLAGOSAN AZ ADATVESZTÉST, A HELYTELEN ADATFELDOLGOZÁST, AZ ÖN VAGY HARMADIK FELEK VESZTESÉGEIT, VALAMINT A MÁS PROGRAMOKKAL VALÓ HIBÁS EGYÜTTMŰKÖDÉST), MÉG AKKOR SEM, HA EZEN FELEK TUDATÁBAN VOLTAK, HOGY ILYEN KÁROK KELETKEZHETNEK.
17. A 15. és 16. szakaszok értelmezése
Amennyiben a fenti garanciaelutasítást és felelősségkorlátozást teljes egészében nem engedélyezik a helyi törvények, úgy a felülvizsgáló bíróságoknak azt a helyi törvényt kell alkalmazniuk, amely legközelebb áll a Programmal kapcsolatos mindennemű polgári peres felelősség elutasításához, kivéve, ha a Program egy példányához garancia vagy felelősségvállalás van mellékelve díjfizetés ellenében.
FELTÉTELEK ÉS KIKÖTÉSEK VÉGE
Hogyan alkalmazhatók ezek a szabályok egy új programra?
Ha valaki egy új programot készít és szeretné, hogy az a bárki számára a lehető leginkább hasznos legyen, akkor a legjobb módszer, hogy azt szabad szoftverré teszi, megengedve mindenkinek a szabad másolást és módosítást a jelen feltételeknek megfelelően.
Ehhez a következő megjegyzést kell csatolni a programhoz. A legbiztosabb ezt minden egyes forrásfájl elejére beírni, így közölve leghatásosabban a garancia visszautasítását; ezenkívül minden fájl kell, hogy tartalmazzon egy copyright sort és egy mutatót arra a helyre, ahol a teljes szöveg található. [A gyakorlatban ezt angolul kell megtenni. A magyar fordítást mellékeljük.]

Preambolo
La GNU General Public License è una licenza libera e basata su copyleft per software e altri tipi di opere.
Le licenze della maggior parte del software e di altre opere materiali sono pensate per togliere la libertà di condividere e modificare tali opere. Al contrario, la GNU General Public License ha l'obiettivo di garantire la libertà di condividere e modificare tutte le versioni di un programma e di fare in modo che esso rimanga software libero per tutti gli utenti. Noi, Free Software Foundation, usiamo la GNU General Public License per la maggior parte del nostro software; essa viene applicata anche a qualunque altro software rilasciato dall'autore sotto questa licenza. Chiunque può utilizzare questa licenza per i suoi programmi.
Quando parliamo di software libero (free software), ci riferiamo al concetto di libertà, non al prezzo. Le nostre General Public License sono progettate per garantire che chiunque abbia la libertà di distribuire copie di software libero (anche dietro pagamento di un prezzo, se lo desidera), che chiunque riceva o possa ricevere il codice sorgente se lo vuole, che chiunque possa apportare modifiche al software o utilizzarne delle porzioni in altri software liberi, e che chiunque sappia che ha il diritto di fare tutte queste cose col software libero.
Per proteggere i vostri diritti, abbiamo la necessità di impedire che altri vi neghino questi diritti o vi obblighino a rinunciarvi. Pertanto, chiunque distribuisce o modifica software rilasciato con questa licenza assume dei precisi doveri: il dovere di rispettare la libertà degli altri.
Per esempio, chi distribuisce copie di un programma rilasciato sotto questa licenza, sia gratis che dietro pagamento di un prezzo, e' obbligato a riconoscere a chi riceve il software esattamente gli stessi diritti che ha ricevuto. Deve garantire che chi riceva il software abbia o possa avere accesso al codice sorgente. E deve chiaramente far conoscere ai destinatari del software queste condizioni, così che essi conoscano quali sono i loro diritti.
Gli sviluppatori che usano la GNU GPL proteggono i vostri diritti in due modi: (1) Rivendicando il copyright sul software, e (2) offrendovi questa licenza che vi garantisce il diritto legale di copiarlo e/o di modificarlo.
Al fine di proteggere gli sviluppatori e gli autori, la GPL spiega chiaramente che non c'è nessuna garanzia per questo software libero. Nell'interesse degli utenti e degli autori, la GPL impone che le versioni modificate del software vengano esplicitamente marcate come "modificate", in maniera tale che eventuali problemi non vengano erroneamente attribuiti agli autori delle versioni precedenti.
Alcuni dispositivi sono progettati per negare agli utenti l'installazione o l'esecuzione di versioni modificate del software che gira sugli stessi, anche se il costruttore si riserva la possibilità di farlo. Ciò è fondamentalmente incompatibile con l'obiettivo di garantire la libertà degli utenti di modificare il software. Una ripetizione sistematica di tali abusi avviene nel campo dei dispositivi per usi individuali, e ciò rende questi abusi ancora più inaccettabili. Pertanto, abbiamo realizzato questa versione della GPL al fine di proibire queste pratiche. Se problemi simili dovessero sorgere in altri ambiti, saremo pronti ad estendere queste misure a questi nuovi ambiti in versioni future della GPL, nella maniera che si renderà necessaria per difendere la libertà degli utenti.
In conclusione, tutti i programmi sono costantemente minacciati dai brevetti sul software. Gli Stati non dovrebbero permettere ai brevetti sul software di limitare lo sviluppo e l'utilizzo di software per computer, ma nei Paesi in cui ciò avviene noi vogliamo evitare in particolare il pericolo che i brevetti sul software applicati ad un programma libero possano renderlo, a tutti gli effetti, proprietario. Per impedire ciò, la GPL assicura che non è possibile utilizzare i brevetti sul software per rendere un programma non libero.
I termini e le condizioni esatte per la copia, la distribuzione e la modifica del software sono riportate di seguito.
Termini e Condizioni
Definizioni
"Questa Licenza" si riferisce alla versione 3 della GNU General Public License.
"Copyright" indica anche leggi simili al copyright che riguardano altri tipi di opere, come le maschere per la produzione di semiconduttori.
"Il Programma" indica qualunque opera che sia soggetta a copyright e che sia rilasciata sotto questa Licenza. I detentori della licenza sono indicati come "tu" o "voi". Licenziatari e destinatari possono essere individui o organizzazioni.
"Modificare" un'opera significa copiare o adattare tutta o parte dell'opera in una maniera che richieda un permesso di copyright, e non indica la semplice azione di fare una esatta copia dell'opera. L'opera risultante viene chiamata "versione modificata" dell'opera precedente, oppure viene detta opera "basata sulla" opera precedente.
Un' "opera coperta da questa licenza" indica il Programma originale non modificato oppure un'opera basata sul Programma.
"Propagare" un'opera significa fare qualunque cosa con essa che, in mancanza di un esplicito permesso, ti renda direttamente o indirettamente perseguibile per violazione secondo le vigenti normative sul copyright, ad eccezione della semplice esecuzione del Programma su un computer o della modifica di una copia privata. La Propagazione include la copia, la distribuzione (con o senza modifiche), la messa a disposizione al pubblico e, in alcuni stati, altre attività simili e connesse.
"Distribuire" un'opera indica qualunque forma di propagazione che permetta a terze parti di effettuare o ricevere delle copie. La mera interazione con un utente attraverso una rete di computer, senza che ci sia alcun trasferimento di una copia, non è considerata "Distribuzione".
Una interfaccia utente interattiva fornisce delle "Adeguate Informazioni Legali" soltanto nel caso in cui include una apposita funzionalità, resa adeguatamente visibile, che (1) visualizzi un'adeguata informazione di copyright, e (2) informi l'utente che non c'è alcuna garanzia sull'opera (eccetto nel caso in cui delle garanzie sono espressamente fornite), dica che il licenziatario può distribuire l'opera utilizzando questa Licenza, indichi come è possibile prendere visione di una copia di questa Licenza. Se l'interfaccia presenta una lista di comandi o di opzioni, come ad esempio un menù, una delle opzioni fornite nella lista deve rispettare questa condizione.
Codice Sorgente.
Il "codice sorgente" di un'opera indica la forma più indicata dell'opera per effettuare modifiche su di essa. Il "codice oggetto" indica qualunque forma dell'opera che non sia codice sorgente.
Una "Interfaccia Standard" è una interfaccia che risponde ad uno standard ufficiale definito da un ente di standardizzazione riconosciuto o, nel caso di interfacce specifiche per un particolare linguaggio di programmazione, una interfaccia che è largamente utilizzata dagli sviluppatori per sviluppare in tale linguaggio.
Le "Librerie di Sistema" di un eseguibile includono qualsiasi cosa, eccetto l'opera nel suo insieme, che (a) sia inclusa nella normale forma di pacchettizzazione di un "Componente Principale", ma che non è parte di quel Componente Principale, e (b) che serva solo a consentire l'uso dell'opera con quel Componente Principale, o per implementare una Interfaccia Standard per la quale esista una implementazione disponibile al pubblico in forma sorgente. Un "Componente Principale", in questo contesto, è un componente essenziale (kernel, gestore di finestre eccetera) dello specifico sistema operativo (ammesso che ce ne sia uno) sul quale l'eseguibile esegue, o un compilatore utilizzato per produrre il programma, o un interprete di codice oggetto utilizzato per eseguire il programma.
Il "Sorgente Corrispondente" per un'opera in forma di codice oggetto è il codice sorgente necessario per generare, installare e (per un programma eseguibile) eseguire il codice oggetto e per modificare l'opera, inclusi gli script per controllare le suddette attività di generazione, installazione ed esecuzione. Non sono incluse le Librerie di Sistema usate dal programma, o gli strumenti di utilità generica o i programmi liberamente accessibili che sono utilizzati, senza modifiche, per portare a termine le suddette attività ma che non fanno parte dell'opera. Per esempio, il sorgente corrispondente include i file con le definizioni delle interfacce associati ai file sorgente dell'opera, e il codice sorgente delle librerie condivise e sottoprogrammi collegati dinamicamente specificatamente necessari per il programma, ad esempio a causa di stretta comunicazione dati o di controllo di flusso tra questi sottoprogrammi e altre parti del programma.
Il Sorgente Corrispondente non include qualunque cosa che l'utente possa rigenerare automaticamente da altre parti del Sorgente Corrispondente stesso.
Il Sorgente Corrispondente di un'opera in forma di codice sorgente è l'opera stessa.
Principali Diritti
Tutti i diritti garantiti da questa Licenza sono garantiti per la durata del copyright sul Programma, e sono irrevocabili ammesso che le suddette condizioni siano rispettate. Questa Licenza afferma esplicitamente il tuo permesso illimitato di eseguire il Programma non modificato. Il risultato dell'esecuzione di un programma coperto da questa Licenza è a sua volta coperto da questa Licenza solo se il risultato stesso, a causa del suo contenuto, è un'opera coperta da questa Licenza. Questa Licenza riconosce il tuo diritto all'uso legittimo o altri diritti equivalenti, come stabilito dalla legislazione sul copyright.
Puoi creare, eseguire e propagare programmi coperti da questa Licenza che tu non distribuisci, senza alcuna condizione fino a quando la tua Licenza rimane valida. Puoi distribuire opere coperte da questa Licenza ad altri al solo scopo di ottenere che essi facciano delle modifiche al programma esclusivamente per te, o che ti forniscano dei servizi per l'esecuzione di queste opere, ammesso che tu rispetti i termini di questa Licenza nel distribuire tutto il materiale per il quale non detieni il copyright. Coloro i quali creano o eseguono per conto tuo un programma coperto da questa Licenza lo fanno esclusivamente in tua vece, sotto la tua direzione e il tuo controllo, in maniera tale che sia proibito a costoro effettuare copie di materiale di cui detieni il copyright al di fuori della relazione che intrattengono nei tuoi confronti.
Distribuire opere coperte da licenza in qualunque altra circostanza è consentito soltanto alle condizioni espresse in seguito. Non è consentito sottolicenziare le opere: la sezione 10 lo rende non necessario.
Protezione dei diritti legali degli utenti dalle leggi anti-elusione.
Nessun programma protetto da questa Licenza può essere considerato parte di una misura tecnologica di restrizione che sottosta ad alcuna delle leggi che soddisfano l'articolo 11 del "WIPO copyright treaty" adottato il 20 Dicembre 1996, o a simili leggi che proibiscono o limitano l'elusione di tali misure tecnologiche di restrizione.
Quando distribuisci un programma coperto da questa Licenza, rifiuti tutti i poteri legali atti a proibire l'elusione di misure tecnologiche di restrizione ammesso che tale elusione sia effettuata nell'esercizio dei diritti garantiti da questa Licenza riguardo al programma coperto da questa Licenza, e rinunci all'intenzione di limitare l'operatività o la modifica del programma per far valere, contro i diritti degli utenti del programma, diritti legali tuoi o di terze parti che impediscano l'elusione di misure tecnologiche di restrizione.
Distribuzione di Copie Esatte.
Ti è permesso distribuire copie esatte del codice sorgente del Programma come lo hai ricevuto, con qualunque mezzo, ammesso che tu aggiunga in maniera appropriata su ciascuna copia una appropriata nota di copyright; che tu lasci intatti tutti gli avvisi che affermano che questa Licenza e tutte le clausole non-permissive aggiunte in accordo con la sezione 7 sono valide per il codice che distribuisci; che tu lasci intatti tutti gli avvisi circa l'assenza di garanzia; che tu fornisca a tutti i destinatari una copia di questa Licenza assieme al Programma.
Puoi richiedere il pagamento di un prezzo o di nessun prezzo per ciascuna copia che distribuisci, e puoi offrire supporto o garanzia a pagamento.
Distribuzione di Versioni modificate del sorgente.
Puoi distribuire un'opera basata sul Programma, o le modifiche per produrla a partire dal Programma, nella forma di codice sorgente secondo i termini della sezione 4, ammesso che tu rispetti anche tutte le seguenti condizioni:
L'opera deve recare con sè delle informazioni adeguate che affermino che tu l'hai modificata, indicando la data di modifica.
L'opera deve recare informazioni adeguate che affermino che essa è rilasciata sotto questa Licenza e sotto le condizioni aggiuntive secondo quanto indicato dalla Sezione 7. Questa condizione modifica la condizione espressa alla sezione 4 di "lasciare intatti tutti gli avvisi".
Devi rilasciare l'intera opera, nel suo complesso, sotto questa Licenza a chiunque venga in possesso di una copia di essa. Questa Licenza sarà pertanto applicata, assieme ad eventuali clausole aggiunte in osservanza della Sezione 7, all'opera nel suo complesso, a tutte le sue parti, indipendentemente da come esse siano pacchettizzate. Questa Licenza nega il permesso di licenziare l'opera in qualunque altro modo, ma non rende nullo un tale permesso ammesso che tu lo abbia ricevuto separatamente.
Se l'opera ha delle interfacce utente interattive, ciascuna deve mostrare delle Adeguate Informazioni Legali; altrimenti, se il Programma ha delle interfacce interattive che non visualizzano delle Adeguate Informazioni Legali, il tuo programma non è obbligato a visualizzarle.
La giustapposizione di un'opera coperta da questa Licenza assieme ad altre opere separate e indipendenti, che non sono per loro natura estensioni del Programma, e che non sono combinate con esso a formare un altro programma più grande, dentro o in uno stesso supporto di memorizzazione a lungo termine o di distribuzione, è semplicemente detto "aggregato" se la raccolta e il suo copyright non sono utilizzati per limitare l'accesso o i diritti legali degli utenti della raccolta stessa oltre ciò che ciascun singolo programma consente. L'inclusione di un programma coperto da questa Licenza in un aggregato non comporta l'applicazione di questa Licenza alle altre parti dell'aggregato.
Distribuzione in formato non-sorgente
Puoi distribuire un programma coperto da questa Licenza in formato di codice oggetto secondo i termini delle sezioni 4 e 5, ammesso che tu fornisca anche il Sorgente Corrispondente in formato comprensibile da un computer sotto i termini di questa stessa Licenza, in uno dei seguenti modi:
Distribuendo il codice oggetto in, o contenuto in, un prodotto fisico (inclusi i mezzi fisici di distribuzione), accompagnato dal Sorgente Corrispondente su un supporto fisico duraturo comunemente utilizzato per lo scambio di software.
Distribuendo il codice oggetto in, o contenuto in, un prodotto fisico (inclusi i mezzi fisici di distribuzione), accompagnato da un'offerta scritta, valida per almeno tre anni e valida per tutto il tempo durante il quale tu offri ricambi o supporto per quel modello di prodotto, di fornire a chiunque possieda il codice oggetto (1) una copia del Sorgente Corrispondente di tutto il software contenuto nel prodotto che è coperto da questa Licenza, su un supporto fisico duraturo comunemente utilizzato per lo scambio di software, ad un prezzo non superiore al costo ragionevole per effettuare fisicamente tale distribuzione del sorgente, oppure (2) accesso alla copia del Sorgente Corrispondente attraverso un server di rete senza alcun costo aggiuntivo.
Distribuendo copie singole del codice oggetto assieme ad una copia dell'offerta scritta di fornire il Sorgente Corrispondente. Questa possibilità è permessa soltanto occasionalmente e per fini non commerciali, e solo se tu hai ricevuto il codice oggetto assieme ad una tale offerta, in accordo alla sezione 6b.
Distribuendo il codice oggetto mediante accesso da un luogo designato (gratis o dietro pagamento di un prezzo), e offrendo un accesso equivalente al Sorgente Corrispondente alla stessa maniera a partire dallo stesso luogo senza costi aggiuntivi. Non devi obbligare i destinatari a copiare il Sorgente Corrispondente assieme al codice oggetto. Se il luogo dal quale copiare il codice oggetto è un server di rete, il Sorgente Corrispondente può trovarsi su un server differente (gestito da te o da terze parti) che fornisca funzionalità equivalenti per la copia, a patto che tu fornisca delle indicazioni chiare accanto al codice oggetto che indichino dove trovare il Sorgente Corrispondente. Indipendentemente da quale server ospiti il Sorgente Corrispondente, tu rimani obbligato ad assicurare che esso rimanga disponibile per tutto il tempo necessario a soddisfare queste condizioni.
Distribuendo il codice oggetto mediante trasmissione peer-to-peer, a patto che tu informi gli altri peer circa il luogo in cui il codice oggetto e il Sorgente Corrispondente sono gratuitamente offerti al pubblico secondo i termini della sezione 6d.
Una porzione separabile del codice oggetto, il cui sorgente è escluso dal Sorgente Corrispondente e trattato come Libreria di Sistema, non deve essere obbligatoriamente inclusa nella distribuzione del codice oggetto del programma.
Un "Prodotto Utente" è un (1) "prodotto consumer", cioè qualunque proprietà personale tangibile che è normalmente utilizzata per scopi personali, familiari o domestici, oppure (2) qualunque cosa progettata o venduta per essere utilizzata in ambiente domestico. Nella classificazione di un prodotto come "prodotto consumer", i casi dubbi andranno risolti in favore dell'ambito di applicazione. Per un dato prodotto ricevuto da un dato utente, "normalmente utilizzato" si riferisce ad un uso tipico o comune di quella classe di prodotti, indipendentemente dallo stato dell'utente specifico o dal modo in cui l'utente specifico utilizza, o si aspetta o ci si aspetta che utilizzi, il prodotto. Un prodotto è un "prodotto consumer" indipendentemente dal fatto che abbia usi commerciali, industriali o diversi da quelli "consumer", a meno che questi usi non rappresentino il solo modo utile di utilizzare il prodotto in questione.
Le "Informazioni di Installazione" per un Prodotto Utente sono i metodi, le procedure, le chiavi di autorizzazioni o altre informazioni necessarie per installare ed eseguire versioni modificate di un programma coperto da questa Licenza all'interno di un Prodotto Utente, a partire da versioni modificate dei suoi Sorgenti Corrispondenti. Tali informazioni devono essere sufficienti ad assicurare che il funzionamento del codice oggetto modificato non sia in nessun caso proibito o ostacolato per il solo fatto che sono state apportate delle modifiche.
Se distribuisci un codice oggetto secondo le condizioni di questa sezione in, o assieme, o specificatamente per l'uso in o con un Prodotto Utente, e la distribuzione avviene come parte di una transazione nella quale il diritto di possesso e di uso del Prodotto Utente viene trasferito al destinatario per sempre o per un periodo prefissato (indipendentemente da come la transazione sia caratterizzata), il Sorgente Corrispondente distribuito secondo le condizioni di questa sezione deve essere accompagnato dalle Informazioni di Installazione. Questa condizione non è richiesta se nè tu nè una terza parte ha la possibilità di installare versioni modificate del codice oggetto sul Prodotto Utente (ad esempio, se il programma è installato su una ROM)
La condizione che richiede di fornire delle Informazioni di Installazione non implica che venga fornito supporto, garanzia o aggiornamenti per un programma che è stato modificato o installato dal destinatario, o per il Prodotto Utente in cui esso è stato modificato o installato. L'accesso ad una rete può essere negato se le modifiche apportate impattano materialmente sull'operatività della rete o se violano le regole e i protocolli di comunicazione attraverso la rete.
Il Sorgente Corrispondente distribuito, e le Informazioni di Installazione fornite, in accordo con questa sezione, devono essere in un formato che sia pubblicamente documentato (e con una implementazione pubblicamente disponibile in formato di codice sorgente), e non devono richiedere speciali password o chiavi per essere spacchettate, lette o copiate.
Condizioni Aggiuntive.
Le "Condizioni Aggiuntive" sono condizioni che completano le condizioni di questa Licenza permettendo delle eccezioni a una o più delle condizioni sopra elencate. Le condizioni aggiuntive che sono applicabili all'intero Programma devono essere considerate come se fossero incluse in questa Licenza, a patto che esse siano valide secondo le normative vigenti. Se alcune condizioni aggiuntive fanno riferimento soltanto ad alcune parti del Programma, quelle parti possono essere utilizzate separatamente sotto le stesse condizioni, ma l'intero Programma rimane sottoposto a questa Licenza senza riferimento ad alcuna condizione aggiuntiva.
Quando distribuisci una copia di un programma coperto da questa Licenza, puoi, a tua discrezione, eliminare qualunque condizione aggiuntiva dalla copia, o da parte di essa. (Le Condizioni Aggiuntive possono essere scritte in maniera tale da richiedere la loro rimozione in certi casi di modifica del Programma). Puoi aggiungere Condizioni Aggiuntive su materiale, aggiunto da te ad un'opera coperta da questa Licenza, per il quale hai o puoi garantire un'adeguata licenza di copyright.
Indipendentemente da qualunque altra condizione di questa Licenza, e per il materiale che aggiungi ad un'opera coperta da questa Licenza, puoi (se autorizzato dai legittimi detentori del copyright per il suddetto materiale) aggiungere alle condizioni di questa Licenza delle condizioni che:
Negano la garanzia o limitano la responsabilità del Programma in maniera differente da quanto riportato nelle sezioni 15 e 16 di questa Licenza; oppure
Richiedono il mantenimento di specifiche e circostanziate informative legali o di note di attribuzione ad autori nel materiale o assieme alle Adeguate Informazioni Legali mostrate dal Programma che lo contiene; oppure
Proibiscono di fornire informazioni errate o ingannevoli sull'origine e la provenienza del materiale in oggetto, o richiedono che versioni modificate di tale materiale siano appositamente marcate in maniera differente rispetto alla versione originale; oppure
Limitano l'utilizzo per scopi pubblicitari del nome dei detentori del copyright o degli autori del materiale; oppure
Rifiutano di garantire diritti secondo le leggi sulla proprietà intellettuale circa l'uso di nomi, marchi di fabbrica o similari; oppure
Richiedono l'indennizzo dei detentori del copyright o degli autori del materiale in oggetto da parte di chi distribuisce il materiale (o versioni modificate dello stesso) con impegni contrattuali circa la responsabilità nei confronti del destinatario, per qualunque responsabilità che questi impegni contrattuali dovessero imporre direttamente ai suddetti detentori del copyright e autori.
Tutte le altre condizioni addizionali non-permissive sono considerate "ulteriori restrizioni", secondo il significato specificato alla sezione 10. Se il Programma o parti di esso contengono, all'atto della ricezione dello stesso, informative che specificano che esso è soggetto a questa Licenza assieme ad una condizione che è una "ulteriore restrizione", puoi rimuovere quest'ultima condizione. Se un documento di licenza contiene ulteriori restrizioni ma permette di rilicenziare o distribuire il Programma con questa Licenza, puoi aggiungere al Programma del materiale coperto dalle condizioni di quel documento di licenza, a patto che le ulteriori restrizioni non compaiano nelle versioni rilicenziate o ridistribuite.
Se aggiungi ad un Programma coperto da questa Licenza delle condizioni aggiuntive in accordo con questa sezione, devi aggiungere anche, nei file sorgenti corrispondenti, un avviso che riassuma le condizioni aggiuntive applicate a quei file, ovvero un avviso che specifichi dove è possibile trovare copia delle condizioni aggiunte.
Tutte le Condizioni aggiuntive, permissive o non-permissive, devono essere espresse nella forma di una licenza scritta e separata, o espresse esplicitamente come eccezioni; in entrambi i casi valgono le condizioni succitate.
Cessazione di Licenza
Non puoi propagare o modificare un programma coperto da questa Licenza in maniera diversa da quanto espressamente consentito da questa Licenza. Qualunque tentativo di propagare o modificare altrimenti il Programma è nullo, e provoca l'immediata cessazione dei diritti garantiti da questa Licenza (compresi tutte le eventuali licenze di brevetto garantite ai sensi del terzo paragrafo della sezione 11).
In ogni caso, se cessano tutte le violazioni di questa Licenza, allora la tua licenza da parte di un dato detentore del copyright viene ripristinata (a) in via cautelativa, a meno che e fino a quando il detentore del copyright non cessa esplicitamente e definitivamente la tua licenza, e (b) in via permanente se il detentore del copyright non ti notifica in alcun modo la violazione entro 60 giorni dalla cessazione della licenza.
Inoltre, la tua licenza da parte di un dato detentore del copyright viene ripristinata in maniera permanente se il detentore del copyright ti notifica la violazione in maniera adeguata, se questa è la prima volta che ricevi una notifica di violazione di questa Licenza (per qualunque Programma) dallo stesso detentore di copyright, e se rimedi alla violazione entro 30 giorni dalla data di ricezione della notifica di violazione.
La cessazione dei tuoi diritti come specificato in questa sezione non provoca la cessazione delle licenze di terze parti che abbiano ricevuto copie o diritti da te secondo questa Licenza. Se i tuoi diritti cessano e non sono ristabiliti in via permanente, non hai diritto di ricevere nuove licenze per lo stesso materiale, secondo quanto stabilito nella sezione 10.
L'ottenimento di copie non richiede l'accettazione della Licenza
Non sei obbligato ad accettare i termini di questa Licenza al solo fine di ottenere o eseguire una copia del Programma. Similmente, propagazioni collaterali di un Programma coperto da questa Licenza che occorrono come semplice conseguenza dell'utilizzo di trasmissioni peer-to-peer per la ricezione di una copia non richiedono l'accettazione della Licenza. In ogni caso, solo e soltanto questa Licenza ti garantiscono il permesso di propagare e modificare qualunque programma coperto da questa Licenza. Queste azioni violano le leggi sul copyright nel caso in cui tu non accetti questa Licenza. Pertanto, modificando o propagando un programma coperto da questa Licenza, indichi implicitamente la tua accettazione della Licenza.
Licenza Automatica per i successivi destinatari
Ogni qual volta distribuisci un programma coperto da questa Licenza, il destinatario riceve automaticamente una licenza, dal detentore originario del copyright, di eseguire, modificare e propagare il programma, nel rispetto di questa Licenza. Non sei ritenuto responsabile del rispetto di questa Licenza da parte di terze parti.
Una "transazione d' entità" è una transazione che trasferisce il controllo di una organizzazione, o sostanzialmente di tutti i suoi beni, che suddivide una organizzazione o che fonde più organizzazioni. Se la propagazione di un programma coperto da questa Licenza è conseguente ad una transazione di entità, ciascuna parte che ha ruolo nella transazione e che riceve una copia del programma riceve allo stesso tempo qualsiasi licenza sul programma che i predecessori della parte possedevano o potevano rilasciare nel rispetto del paragrafo precedente, e in più il diritto di possesso del Sorgente Corrispondente del programma dal predecessore in interesse, se il predecessore lo possiede o se può ottenerlo senza troppe difficoltà.
Non puoi imporre nessuna ulteriore restrizione sull'esercizio dei diritti garantiti o affermati da questa Licenza. Per esempio, non puoi imporre un prezzo di licenza, una royalty, o altri costi per l'esercizio dei diritti garantiti da questa Licenza, a non puoi dar corso ad una controversia (ivi incluse le controversie incrociate o la difesa in cause legali) affermando che siano stati violati dei brevetti a causa della produzione, dell'uso, della vendita, della messa in vendita o dell'importazione del Programma o di sue parti.
Brevetti.
Un "contribuente" è un detentore di copyright che autorizza l'uso secondo questa Licenza di un Programma o di un'opera basata sul Programma. L'opera così licenziata viene chiamata "versione del contribuente".
I "diritti essenziali di brevetto" da parte di un contribuente sono tutti i diritti di brevetto che appartengono o che sono controllati dal contribuente, che siano già acquisiti o che saranno acquisiti in futuro, che possano essere violati in qualche maniera, consentita da questa Licenza, generando, modificando o vendendo la versione del contribuente, ma non includono i diritti che possano essere violati soltanto come conseguenza di ulteriori modifiche alla versione del contribuente. In relazione a questa definizione, il termine "controllo" include il diritto di garantire sottolicenze di brevetto in maniera consistente con le condizioni di questa Licenza.
Ciascun contribuente ti garantisce la licenza di brevetto sui diritti essenziali di brevetto del contribuente stesso non-esclusiva, valida in tutto il mondo, esente da royalty, di creare, usare, vendere, offrire in vendita, importare e altrimenti eseguire, modificare e propagare i contenuti della versione del contribuente.
Nei tre paragrafi successivi, con "licenza di brevetto" si intende qualunque accordo o contratto, comunque denominato, di non rivendicazione di un brevetto (come ad esempio un permesso esplicito di utilizzare un brevetto o un accordo di rinuncia alla persecuzione per violazione di brevetto). "Garantire" una tale licenza di brevetto ad una parte significa portare a termine un tale accordo o contratto di non rivendicazione di brevetto contro la parte.
Se distribuisci un programma coperto da questa Licenza, confidando consapevolmente su una licenza di brevetto, e il Sorgente Corrispondente per il programma non è reso disponibile per la copia, senza alcun onere aggiuntivo e comunque nel rispetto delle condizioni di questa Licenza, attraverso un server di rete pubblicamente accessibile o tramite altri mezzi facilmente accessibili, allora devi (1) fare in modo che il Sorgente Corrispondente sia reso disponibile come sopra, oppure (2) fare in modo di rinunciare ai benefici della licenza di brevetto per quel particolare programma, oppure (3) adoperarti, in maniera consistente con le condizioni di questa Licenza, per estendere la licenza di brevetto a tutti i destinatari successivi. "Confidare consapevolmente" significa che tu sei attualmente cosciente che, eccettuata la licenza di brevetto, la distribuzione da parte tua di un programma protetto da questa Licenza in un paese, o l'utilizzo in un paese del programma coperto da questa Licenza da parte di un destinatario, può violare uno o più brevetti in quel paese che tu hai ragione di ritenere validi.
Se, come conseguenza o in connessione con una singola transazione o con un dato accordo, distribuisci, o fai in modo di distribuire, un programma coperto da questa Licenza, e garantisci una licenza di brevetto per alcune delle parti che ricevono il Programma autorizzandole ad utilizzare, propagare, modificare o distribuire una specifica copia del Programma, allora la licenza di brevetto che fornisci è automaticamente estesa a tutti i destinatari del Programma coperto da questa Licenza e delle opere basate sul Programma.
Una licenza di brevetto è "discriminatoria" se non include nell'ambito della sua copertura, proibisce l'esercizio, o è vincolata al non-esercizio di uno o più dei diritti che sono specificatamente garantiti da questa Licenza. Non puoi distribuire un Programma coperto da questa Licenza se sei parte di un accordo con una terza parte la cui attività comprende la distribuzione di software, secondo il quale tu sei costretto ad un pagamento alla parte terza in funzione della tua attività di distribuzione del Programma, e in conseguenza del quale la parte terza garantisce, a qualunque delle parti che riceveranno il Programma da te, una licenza di brevetto discriminatoria (a) assieme a copie del Programma coperto da questa Licenza distribuite da te (o ad altre copie fatte da codeste copie), oppure (b) principalmente per e in connessione con specifici prodotti o raccolte di prodotti che contengono il Programma, a meno che l'accordo non sia stato stipulato, o le licenze di brevetto non siano state rilasciate, prima del 28 Marzo 2007.
Nessuna parte di questa Licenza può essere interpretata come atta ad escludere o limitare gli effetti di qualunque altra licenza o altri meccanismi di difesa dalla violazione che possano altrimenti essere resi disponibili dalla normativa vigente in materia di brevetti.
Nessuna resa di libertà altrui
Se ti vengono imposte delle condizioni (da un ordine giudiziario, da un accordo o da qualunque altra eventualità) che contraddicono le condizioni di questa Licenza, non sei in nessun modo esonerato dal rispetto delle condizioni di questa Licenza. Se non puoi distribuire un Programma coperto da questa Licenza per sottostare simultaneamente agli obblighi derivanti da questa Licenza e ad altri obblighi pertinenti, allora non puoi distribuire il Programma per nessun motivo. Per esempio, se accetti delle condizioni che ti obbligano a richiedere il pagamento di una royalty per le distribuzioni successivamente effettuate da coloro ai quali hai distribuito il Programma, l'unico modo per soddisfare sia queste condizioni che questa Licenza è evitare del tutto la distribuzione del Programma.
Utilizzo con la GNU Affero General Public License
Indipendentemente da qualunque altra condizione espressa da questa Licenza, hai il permesso di collegare o combinare qualunque Programma coperto da questa Licenza con un'opera rilasciata sotto la versione 3 della licenza GNU Affero General Public License, ottenendo un singolo Programma derivato, e di distribuire il Programma risultante. Le condizioni di questa Licenza continuano a valere per le parti riguardanti il Programma che sono coperte da questa Licenza, mentre le condizioni speciali della GNU Affero General Public License, sezione 13, riguardanti l'interazione mediante rete, saranno applicate al Programma così risultante.
Versioni rivedute di questa Licenza
La Free Software Foundation può pubblicare delle versioni rivedute e/o delle nuove versioni della GNU General Public License di tanto in tanto. Tali versioni saranno simili, nello spirito, alla presente versione, ma potranno differire nei dettagli al fine di affrontare nuovi problemi e nuove situazioni.
A ciascuna versione viene assegnato un numero identificativo di versione. Se il Programma specifica che si applica a sè stesso una certa versione della GNU General Public License, "o qualunque altra versione successiva", hai la possibilità di sottostare alle condizioni di quella specifica versione o di qualunque altra versione successiva pubblicata dalla Free Software Foundation. Se il Programma non specifica un numero di versione della GNU General Public License, puoi scegliere qualunque versione della GNU General Public License pubblicata dalla Free Software Foundation.
Se il Programma specifica che un sostituto o un procuratore può decidere quali versioni future della GNU General Public License posso essere utilizzate, allora tale scelta di accettazione di una data versione ti autorizza, in maniera permanente, ad utilizzare quella versione della Licenza per il Programma.
Versioni successive della Licenza possono garantire diritti aggiuntivi o leggermente differenti. Ad ogni modo, nessun obbligo aggiuntivo viene imposto agli autori o ai detentori di copyright come conseguenza della tua scelta di adottare una versione successiva della Licenza.
Rinuncia alla Garanzia
NON C'E' NESSUNA GARANZIA PER IL PROGRAMMA, PER QUANTO CONSENTITO DALLE VIGENTI NORMATIVE. ECCETTO QUANDO ALTRIMENTI STABILITO PER ISCRITTO, I DETENTORI DEL COPYRIGHT E/O LE ALTRE PARTI FORNISCONO IL PROGRAMMA "COSI' COME È" SENZA GARANZIA DI ALCUN TIPO, NE' ESPRESSA NE' IMPLICITA, INCLUSE, MA NON LIMITATE A, LE GARANZIE DI COMMERCIABILITA' O DI UTILIZZABILITA' PER UN PARTICOLARE SCOPO. L'INTERO RISCHIO CONCERNENTE LA QUALITA' E LE PRESTAZIONI DEL PROGRAMMA E' DEL LICENZIATARIO. SE IL PROGRAMMA DOVESSE RISULTARE DIFETTOSO, IL LICENZIATARIO SI ASSUME I COSTI DI MANUTENZIONE, RIPARAZIONE O CORREZIONE.
Limitazione di Responsabilità
IN NESSUN CASO, A MENO CHE NON SIA RICHIESTO DALLA NORMATIVA VIGENTE O CONCORDATO PER ISCRITTO, I DETENTORI DEL COPYRIGHT, O QUALUNQUE ALTRA PARTE CHE MODIICA E/O DISTRIBUISCE IL PROGRAMMA SECONDO LE CONDIZIONI PRECEDENTI, POSSONO ESSERE RITENUTI RESPONSABILI NEI CONFRONTI DEL LICENZIATARIO PER DANNI, INCLUSO QUALUNQUE DANNEGGIAMENTO GENERICO, SPECIALE, INCIDENTALE O CONSEQUENZIALE DOVUTO ALL'USO O ALL'IMPOSSIBILITA' D'USO DEL PROGRAMMA (INCLUSI, MA NON LIMITATI A, LE PERDITE DI DATI, LA CORRUZIONE DI DATI, LE PERDITE SOSTENUTE DAL LICENZIATARIO O DA TERZE PARTI O L'IMPOSSIBILITA' DEL PROGRAMMA A FUNZIONARE ASSIEME AD ALTRI PROGRAMMI), ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL DETENTORE O LE ALTRE PARTI SIANO STATI AVVISATI CIRCA LA POSSIBILITA' DI TALI DANNEGGIAMENTI.
Interpretazione delle Sezioni 15 e 16.
Se la dichiarazione di garanzia e la limitazione di responsabilità fornite precedentemente non hanno effetto legale in un paese a causa delle loro condizioni, le corti di giustizia devono applicare la norma locale che più si avvicini al rifiuto assoluto di qualsivoglia responsabilità civile relativa al Programma, a meno che una garanzia o una assunzione di responsabilità scritta non accompagni una copia del programma ottenuta dietro pagamento.
Fine dei Termini e delle Condizioni
Come applicare questre condizioni di Licenza ai vostri programmi
Se sviluppi un nuovo programma, e vuoi che esso sia della massima utilità, il modo migliore è renderlo software libero in modo che chiunque possa ridistribuirlo e modificarlo secondo i termini di questa Licenza.
Per fare ciò, allega le seguenti note informative al programma. Il modo migliore è inserirle all'inizio di ciascun file sorgente, al fine di rimarcare adeguatamente la mancanza di garanzia; ciascun file dovrebbe inoltre contenere la dichiarazione di copyright e un riferimento al posto in cui è possibile ottenere la versione completa delle note informative.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
Inoltre, aggiungi le informazioni necessarie a contattarti via posta ordinaria o via posta elettronica.
Se il programma interagisce mediante terminale, fai in modo che visualizzi, quando viene avviato in modalità interattiva, un breve messaggio come quello che segue:

Gli ipotetici comandi show w e show c devono visualizzare le parti corrispondenti della GNU General Public License. Naturalmente i comandi del tuo programma potrebbero essere differenti; per una interfaccia di tipo GUI, dovresti usare un bottone "About" o "Info".
Devi inoltre fare in modo che il tuo datore di lavoro (se lavori come programmatore presso terzi) o la tua scuola, eventualmente, firmino una "rinuncia al copyright" sul programma, se necessario. Per maggiori informazioni su questo punto, e su come applicare e rispettare la GNU GPL, consultare la pagina http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
La GNU General Public License non consente di incorporare il programma all'interno di software proprietario. Se il tuo programma è una libreria di funzioni, potresti ritenere più opportuno consentire il collegamento tra software proprietario e la tua libreria. Se è questo ciò che vuoi, allora utilizza la GNU Lesser General Public License anziché questa Licenza, ma prima leggi http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.

GNU ALGEMENE PUBLIEKE LICENTIE
Versie 3, 29 juni 2007
Auteursrecht © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Het is iedereen toegestaan om letterlijke kopieën van deze licentievoorwaarden te
maken en te verspreiden. Het wijzigen van deze licentievoorwaarden is niet toegestaan.
Overwegingen
De GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie is een vrije, copyleft licentie voor software en
andersoortige werken.
De licenties voor de meeste software en andere auteursrechtelijk beschermde werken
zijn geschreven om jouw vrijheid om die werken te delen en te wijzigen in te perken. In
tegenstelling hiermee is de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie bedoeld om jouw vrijheid
te garanderen om alle versies van een programma te delen en wijzigen – om te
verzekeren dat het vrije software blijft voor alle gebruikers. Wij, de Free Software
Foundation, gebruiken de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie voor het grootste deel van
onze software; deze is ook van toepassing op elk ander werk dat is geopenbaard door
de auteurs. Je kunt deze licentie ook op jouw programma’s van toepassing verklaren.
Wanneer wij het hebben over vrije software, dan bedoelen wij vrijheid, niet ‘gratis’. Onze
GNU Algemene Publieke Licenties zijn geschreven om te verzekeren dat jij de vrijheid
hebt om kopieën van vrije software te verspreiden (en hiervoor een vergoeding te
vragen als je dat wenst), om de broncode te ontvangen of te kunnen krijgen, om de
1 Deze Nederlandse vertaling van de GPL v.3 is gemaakt door Bart Beuving en Maurits Westerik (beiden
advocaat bij Bird & Bird en gespecialiseerd in IT en intellectueel eigendomsrecht) en mag onder de
voorwaarden van de Creative Commons licentie naamsvermelding-geen afgeleide werken 3.0 door iedereen
worden gekopieerd en gebruikt. Deze versie van de Nederlandse vertaling kan worden aangeduid met ‘GPL
v.3 (NL 1.0)’.
Bij deze vertaling is de vrijheid genomen om verwijzingen wat nader te verduidelijken en de gedefinieerde
termen consequent met hoofdletters te schrijven. Ook zijn soms opsommingstekens toegevoegd. Wat de
terminologie betreft is zo dicht mogelijk bij de Engelse versie gebleven en zijn de gekozen Nederlandse
woorden dus niet de gangbare Nederlandse juridische termen (zo wordt hier het woord ‘kopiëren ‘gebruikt,
waar de Auteurswet het heeft over ‘openbaar maken en verveelvoudigen’).
software te kunnen wijzigen of stukken hiervan te kunnen gebruiken in nieuwe vrije
programma’s en om te weten dat je deze dingen kunt doen.
Om jouw rechten te beschermen, moeten wij voorkomen dat anderen jou deze rechten
ontzeggen of jou vragen afstand te doen van deze rechten. Daarom heb jij bepaalde
verantwoordelijkheden als jij kopieën van de software verspreidt, of als jij deze software
wijzigt: verantwoordelijkheden om de vrijheden van anderen te respecteren.
Bijvoorbeeld, als jij kopieën van een dergelijk programma verspreidt, of het nu gratis is of
tegen een vergoeding, dan moet je aan de ontvangers dezelfde vrijheden doorgeven als
je hebt ontvangen. Je moet zorgen dat ook zij de broncode ontvangen of kunnen
verkrijgen. Ook moet je ze deze voorwaarden tonen zodat zij hun rechten kennen.
Ontwikkelaars die gebruik maken van de GNU GPL beschermen jouw rechten in twee
stappen: (1) ze verduidelijken dat zij auteursrecht hebben op de software, en (2) bieden
jou deze Licentie die jou juridisch gezien toestemming geeft om deze software te
kopiëren, verspreiden en/of te wijzigen.
Ter bescherming van de ontwikkelaars en de auteurs, staat duidelijk in de GPL dat er
geen garanties op deze vrije software zitten. Ten behoeve van zowel de gebruikers als
de auteurs vereist de GPL dat gewijzigde versies ook als gewijzigd worden aangemerkt
zodat eventuele problemen met die versies niet onterecht zullen worden toegeschreven
aan auteurs van eerdere versies.
Sommige apparaten zijn ontworpen om gebruikers de mogelijkheid te ontzeggen om
gewijzigde versies van de in die apparaten gebruikte software te installeren of te
gebruiken, hoewel de fabri-kant dat wel kan. Dit is fundamenteel onverenigbaar met het
doel de vrijheid van de gebruikers om de software te wijzigen, te waarborgen. Het
systematisch patroon van dergelijk misbruik komt voo-ral voor in de consumentenmarkt,
wat nu juist de plek is waar dit misbruik het minst acceptabel is.
Daarom hebben wij deze versie van de GPL zo geschreven dat zulke praktijken voor
dergelijke apparaten wordt verboden. Als zulke problemen zich in grote mate voordoen
in andere gebieden, staan wij klaar om deze bepaling in toekomstige versies van de
GPL uit te breiden, zoveel als nodig is om de vrijheid van gebruikers te beschermen.
Tot slot, elk programma wordt voortdurend bedreigd door softwareoctrooien. Staten
zouden het niet moeten toestaan dat octrooien de ontwikkeling en het gebruik van
software op herprogrammeerbare computers beperken, maar in die staten die dat wel
doen, willen wij het bijzondere gevaar vermijden dat octrooien die van toepassing zijn op
een vrij programma dat programma feitelijk ‘gesloten software’ maken. Om dit te
voorkomen zorgt de GPL dat octrooien niet kunnen worden gebruikt om het programma
niet-vrij te maken.
De precieze voorwaarden voor het kopiëren, verspreiden en wijzigen volgen hierna. 
VOORWAARDEN
0. Definities.
“Deze Licentie” verwijst naar versie 3 van de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie.
“Auteursrecht” verwijst ook naar auteursrechtelijke wetten die op andere soorten werken
van toepassing zijn, zoals halfgeleider-topografieën.
“Het Programma” verwijst naar ieder voor auteursrechtelijke bescherming vatbaar werk
dat onder deze Licentie wordt gelicentieerd. Elke licentienemer wordt aangesproken als
“jij”. “Licentienemers” en “Ontvangers” kunnen zowel natuurlijke personen als
rechtspersonen zijn.
Het “Wijzigen” van een werk betekent het kopiëren of aanpassen van het geheel of een
deel van een werk op een manier waarvoor auteursrechtelijke toestemming nodig is,
tenzij het het maken van een exacte kopie betreft. Het resulterende werk wordt een
“Gewijzigde Versie” van het eerdere werk of een werk “gebaseerd” op het eerdere werk.
Een “GPL v.3 Werk” betekent ofwel het ongewijzigde Programma of een werk
gebaseerd op het Programma.
“Verspreiden” van een werk verwijst naar elke handeling waarmee je zonder
toestemming direct of indirect aansprakelijk zou zijn voor inbreuk onder het toepasselijke
auteursrecht, behalve het gebruik op een computer of het Wijzigen van een kopie voor
privé-gebruik. Verspreiden omvat kopiëren, distribueren (al dan niet Gewijzigd),
openbaar maken en in sommige landen ook nog andere handelingen.
Het “Overbrengen” van een werk betekent elke vorm van Verspreiden dat andere
partijen in staat stelt om kopieën te maken of te ontvangen. De enkele interactie met een
gebruiker door middel van een computernetwerk zonder verplaatsing van een kopie,
geldt niet als Overbrengen.
Een interactieve gebruikersinterface toont “Passende Juridische Aankondigingen” in de
zin dat het een gemakkelijk en duidelijk zichtbaar deel heeft dat (1) een toepasselijke
auteursrechtaankondiging toont, en (2) de gebruiker duidelijk maakt dat er geen garantie
voor het werk wordt gegeven (behalve voor zover er wel garanties worden gegeven), dat
Licentienemers het werk mogen Overbrengen onder deze Licentie, en hoe men een
kopie van deze Licentie kan bekijken. Indien de interface een lijst van
gebruikerscommando’s of opties geeft, zoals een menu, dan dient een prominent
zichtbaar onderdeel van deze lijst aan deze eis te voldoen.
1. Broncode.
De “Broncode” voor een werk betekent de voorkeursvorm van het werk voor het maken
van aanpassingen hieraan. “Objectcode” betekent elke niet-Broncodevorm van een
werk. 
Een “Standaard Interface” betekent ofwel een interface die een officiële standaard volgt
zoals vastgesteld door een erkend normeringsorgaan,of, in het geval van interfaces die
voor een bepaalde programmeertaal zijn voorgeschreven, een die veel wordt gebruikt
onder ontwikkelaars die in die taal werken.
De “System Libraries” van een werk dat op een computer gebruikt kan worden omvatten
alles, buiten het werk in zijn geheel dat (a) is bijgevoegd in de normale wijze waarop een
Belangrijk Component wordt verpakt maar geen onderdeel is van dat Belangrijke
Component, en (b) alleen dient om het gebruik van het werk met dat Belangrijke
Component mogelijk te maken, of om een Standaard Interface te implementeren
waarvoor een implementatie beschikbaar is voor het publiek in een Broncode-vorm. Een
“Belangrijk Component” in deze context betekent een belangrijk essentieel onderdeel
(kernel, window systeem, enzovoort) van het specifieke besturingssysteem (indien
aanwezig) waarop het op de computer bruikbare werk draait, of een
compileerprogramma dat gebruikt wordt om het werk te produceren, of een objectcode
vertaler die gebruikt wordt om het te draaien.
De “Corresponderende Broncode” voor een werk in Objectcode-vorm betekent alle
Broncode die nodig is om de Objectcode te genereren, installeren en (voor een op
computer bruikbaar werk) de Objectcode te draaien en het werk te Wijzigen, inclusief
scripts om deze acties uit te voeren. Echter, het omvat niet de Systeem Libraries van het
werk, tools voor een algemeen doel of algemeen beschikbare vrije programma’s die
ongewijzigd worden gebruikt bij het uitvoeren van deze handelingen maar geen
onderdeel van het werk vormen. Bijvoorbeeld, Corresponderende Broncode omvat
interfacedefinitie-bestanden die bij de Broncode-bestanden van het werk horen, de
Broncode voor shared libraries en dynamische gelinkte subprogramma’s die het werk
naar haar specifieke ontwerp vereist, zoals door nauw verweven datacommunicatie dan
wel beheersverloop tussen die subprogramma’s en andere delen van het werk.
De Corresponderende Broncode hoeft niet datgene te omvatten dat gebruikers
automatisch opnieuw kunnen genereren uit andere delen van de Corresponderende
Broncode.
De Corresponderende Broncode voor een werk in Broncode-vorm is datzelfde werk.
2. Basisrechten.
Alle rechten die worden verkregen onder deze Licentie worden verkregen voor zolang
het Programma auteursrechtelijk is beschermd en zijn onherroepelijk zolang wordt
voldaan aan de gestelde voorwaarden. Deze Licentie bevestigt expliciet jouw
onbeperkte recht om het niet-gewijzigde Werk te draaien. De output van het draaien van
een GPL v.3 Werk valt uitsluitend ook onder deze Licentie indien deze content naar de
inhoud ervan een GPL v.3 Werk oplevert. Deze Licentie erkent jouw recht op ‘fair use’ of
een ander uit het auteursrecht volgend equivalent hiervan.
Je mag GPL v.3 Werken die je niet Overbrengt, zonder voorwaarden compileren,
draaien en verspreiden, zolang jouw Licentie anderszins van kracht blijft. Je mag GPL
v.3 Werken Overbrengen naar anderen met het enkele doel om deze anderen exclusief
voor jou Wijzigingen te laten maken, of jou de middelen te verschaffen voor het draaien
van die werken, onder de voorwaarde dat jij je houdt aan de voorwaarden van deze 
Licentie bij het Overbrengen van al het materiaal waarbij je geen zeggenschap hebt over
het auteursrecht. De anderen die het Gelicentieerde werk aldus voor jou maken of
draaien moeten dit exclusief voor jou doen, jouw aanwijzingen volgen en onder jouw
controle, onder voorwaarden die hun verbieden kopieën te maken van jouw
auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal buiten hun relatie met jou.
Het Overbrengen is onder elke andere omstandigheden uitsluitend toegestaan onder de
voorwaarden die hieronder staan vermeld. Sublicentieren is niet toegestaan; artikel 10
maakt dit onnodig.
3. Bescherming van de rechten van gebruikers tegen anti-omzeilingswetgeving
Geen GPL v.3 Werk zal geacht worden een onderdeel te zijn van een doeltreffende
technologische maatregel onder elke geldende wet zoals bedoeld in artikel 11 van het
WIPO Auteursrechtverdrag van 20 december 1996, of vergelijkbare wetten die
omzeilingsmaatregelen verbieden of beperken.
Wanneer je een GPL v.3 Werk Overbrengt doe je afstand van elk recht om omzeiling
van technische maatregelen te verbieden voor zover een dergelijke omzeiling tot stand
komt door een beroep te doen op de rechten die volgen uit deze Licentie met betrekking
op het GPL v.3 Werk, en daarbij wijs je ook elke voornemen van de hand om het gebruik
of de aanpassing van het werk te beperken als een middel om jouw of andermans recht
op omzeiling te verbieden te handhaven ten opzichte van de gebruikers van het werk.
4. Het Overbrengen van letterlijke kopieën.
Je mag letterlijke kopieën van de Broncode van het Programma Overbrengen zoals je
die zelf gekregen hebt, op elk medium, op voorwaarde dat je op duidelijk waarneembare
en passende wijze op elke kopie een toepasselijke kennisgeving van auteursrecht
aanbrengt; alle kennisgevingen dat deze Licentie en de eventuele beperkende
voorwaarden volgens Artikel 7 van toepassing zijn op de code intact laat; alle
kennisgevingen dat elke vorm van garantie wordt uitgesloten intact laat; en alle
ontvangers samen met het Programma een kopie van deze Licentie geeft.
Je mag naar eigen keus al dan niet een vergoeding vragen voor elke kopie die je
Overbrengt, en je mag support of garantie aanbieden voor een vergoeding.
5. Het Overbrengen van aangepaste Broncode Versies.
Het is je toegestaan een werk dat gebaseerd is op het Programma, of enkel de nodige
aanpassingen die nodig zijn om het op basis van het Programma te produceren, Over te
brengen in Broncodevorm onder de voorwaarden zoals genoemd in Artikel 4, zolang je
ook voldoet aan de volgende voorwaarden:
a) Het werk moet duidelijk waarneembare kennisgevingen dragen, waarin wordt gemeld
dat jij het hebt aangepast, en onder vermelding van de relevante datum.
b) Het werk moet duidelijk waarneembare kennisgevingen dragen waarin wordt vermeld
dat het onder deze Licentie wordt uitgebracht en ook onder eventuele aanvullende 
voorwaarden die overeenkomstig Artikel 7 zijn toegevoegd. Dit vereiste wijzigt het
vereiste in Artikel 4 om "alle kennisgevingen intact te houden".
c) Je moet het hele werk licentiëren, als geheel, onder deze Licentie aan iedereen die
een kopie verkrijgt. Deze Licentie zal dan ook van toepassing zijn, samen met eventuele
aanvullende voorwaarden die overeenkomstig Artikel 7 zijn toegevoegd, op het geheel
van het werk, en al haar delen, ongeacht in welke samenstelling deze zijn verspreid.
Deze Licentie geeft geen toestemming op enige andere manier te licentiëren, maar het
stelt een dergelijke toestemming die je apart hebt verkregen niet buiten werking.
d) Als het werk interactieve gebruikersinterfaces kent moet elk daarvan Passende
Juridische Aankondigingen tonen; echter, als het Programma interactieve interfaces
heeft die geen Passende Juridische Aankondigingen tonen, dan hoeft jouw werk dat niet
aan de interactieve interfaces van het Programma toe te voegen.
Een compilatie van een GPL v.3 Werk met andere afzonderlijke en onafhankelijke
werken, die naar hun aard geen uitbreiding van het GPL v.3 Werk zijn en die niet op
dusdanige wijze met het GPL v.3 Werk zijn gecombineerd zodat het samen een groter
programma oplevert, in of op een opslageenheid of verspreidingsmedium, wordt een
“Aggregaat” genoemd als de compilatie en het daarop rustend auteursrecht niet worden
gebruikt om de toegang of de juridische rechten van de gebruikers van de compilatie
verder te beperken dan hetgeen in de andere delen van de compilatie is toegestaan. Het
opnemen van een GPL v.3 Werk in een Aggregaat maakt niet dat deze Licentie van
toepassing wordt op andere onderdelen van het Aggregaat.
6. Het Doorgeven van niet-Broncodevormen.
Je mag een GPL v.3 Werk Overbrengen in Objectcode-vorm onder de voorwaarden van
Artikelen 4 en 5, zolang je ook de machine-leesbare Corresponderende Broncode
Overbrengt onder de voorwaarden van deze Licentie op een van de volgende manieren:
• a) Breng de Objectcode over in of vervat in een tastbaar product (waaronder een
fysiek distributiemedium), samen met de Corresponderende Broncode
vastgelegd op een duurzame fysieke drager die bedoeld is voor het uitwisselen
van software.
• b) Breng de Objectcode over in of vervat in een tastbaar product (waaronder een
fysiek distributiemedium), samen met een geschreven aanbod, dat ten minste
drie jaar geldig is en geldig voor zolang als jij reserveonderdelen of
klantondersteuning voor dat model product aanbiedt, om iedereen die de
Objectcode bezit ofwel:
(1) een kopie van de Corresponderende Broncode voor alle software in het
product dat onder deze Licentie valt te verschaffen, vastgelegd op een duurzame
fysieke drager die bedoeld is voor het uitwisselen van software, voor een prijs die
niet hoger is dan jouw redelijke kosten voor het fysiek uitvoeren van deze
Doorgifteverplichting; of
(2) de mogelijkheid om kosteloos een kopie van de Corresponderende Broncode 
te maken vanaf een netwerkserver.
• c) Breng individuele kopieën van de Objectcode over, samen met een kopie van
een geschreven aanbod om de Corresponderende Broncode te verschaffen. Dit
alternatief is alleen toegestaan als uitzondering en alleen voor niet-commercieel
gebruik, en alleen als jij zelf de Objectcode hebt ontvangen met een dergelijk
aanbod, in overeenstemming met Artikel 6b.
• d) Breng de Objectcode over door toegang te bieden tot een hiervoor
aangewezen plaats (gratis of tegen een vergoeding), en biedt overeenkomstige
toegang aan tot de Corresponderende Broncode via dezelfde plaats zonder
daarvoor verdere kosten in rekening te brengen. Je hoeft ontvangers niet te
verplichten de Corresponderende Broncode samen met de Objectcode te
kopiëren. Als de plaats waar de Objectcode kan worden gekopieerd een
netwerkserver is, mag de Corresponderende Broncode ook op een andere
server staan (beheerd door jou of door een derde partij) die overeenkomstige
kopieerfaciliteiten biedt, zolang je duidelijke aanwijzingen bij de Objectcode
verschaft waar de Corresponderende Broncode kan worden gevonden.
Ongeacht op welke server de Corresponderende Broncode is geplaatst, blijf je
verplicht om er voor te zorgen dat deze Corresponderende Broncode
beschikbaar blijft zolang als nodig is om te voldoen aan deze voorwaarden.
• e) Breng de Objectcode over door gebruik te maken van peer-to-peer verzending
onder de voorwaarde dat je de andere peers informeert waar de Objectcode en
Corresponderende Broncode van het werk worden aangeboden aan het publiek
zonder verdere kosten zoals bedoeld in Artikel 6b.
Een te onderscheiden deel van de Objectcode, waarvan de Broncode is uitgezonderd
van de Corresponderende Broncode als een Systeem Library, hoeven niet te worden
bijgeleverd bij het Overbrengen van het Werk in Objectcode-vorm.
Een “Gebruikersproduct” is ofwel (1) een “consumentenproduct”, wat zoveel wil zeggen
als elk tastbaar persoonlijk gebruiksvoorwerp dat normaliter gebruikt wordt voor
persoonlijke, familie of huishoudelijke doeleinden, of (2) alles dat ontworpen of verkocht
wordt voor gebruik in een verblijfsplaats. Bij het vaststellen of sprake is van een
consumentenproduct, worden twijfelachtige gevallen aangemerkt als een
consumentenproduct. Voor een specifiek product dat door een gebruiker wordt
ontvangen betekent ‘normaliter gebruikt’ het specifieke of normale gebruik van dat type
product, ongeacht de hoedanigheid van de specifieke gebruiker of de manier waarop
deze gebruiker het product daadwerkelijk gebruikt, of verwacht of wordt verwacht het
product te gebruiken. Een product is een consumentenproduct ongeacht of het product
substantiële, commerciële, industriële of niet-consumenten toepassingen kent, tenzij
zulke toepassingen de enige significante toepassing van het product
vertegenwoordigen.
“Installatie-informatie” voor een Gebruikersproduct betekent alle methodes, procedures,
authorisatiesleutels of andere informatie nodig voor het installeren en uitvoeren van
Gewijzigde versies van een GPL v.3 Werk in dat Gebruikersproduct uitgaande van een
Gewijzigde versie van de Correponderende Broncode. De informatie moet volstaan om
te garanderen dat het verdere functioneren van de Gewijzigde Objectcode op geen 
enkele wijze wordt voorkomen of verstoord enkel en alleen omdat er Wijzigingen zijn
aangebracht.
Als je een Objectcode werk onder de werking van deze bepaling Overbrengt in, met of
bestemd voor gebruik in een Gebruikersproduct, en het Overbrengen vormt deel van
een transactie waarin het eigendom van het Gebruikersproduct voor bepaalde of
onbepaalde tijd wordt overgedragen aan de ontvanger (ongeacht hoe deze transactie
wordt betiteld), dan moet de Corresponderende Broncode die onder de werking van
deze bepaling wordt Overgebracht, worden vergezeld door de Installatie-informatie.
Maar deze verplichting vervalt als jij noch een derde nog de mogelijkheid heeft om
Gewijzigde Objectcode in het Gebruikersproduct te installeren (als het werk bijvoorbeeld
in een ROM is geïnstalleerd).
De verplichting om Installatie-informatie te verschaffen houdt geen verplichting in om
supportdiensten te blijven leveren voor een product dat is Gewijzigd of geïnstalleerd
door de ontvanger, of voor het Gebruikersproduct waarin het is Gewijzigd of
geïnstalleerd. Toegang tot een netwerk mag worden geweigerd als de Wijziging zelf de
werking van het netwerk materieel en negatief beïnvloedt of als het de regels en
protocollen voor communicatie over het netwerk overtreedt.
Overgebrachte Corresponderende Broncode en verschafte Installatie-informatie in
overeenstemming met dit artikel moet in een format beschikbaar worden gesteld dat
publiekelijk is gedocumenteerd (en waarvan een implementatie beschikbaar is voor het
publiek in een Broncode-vorm) en mag geen speciale toegangscode of sleutel nodig
hebben voor het uitpakken, lezen of kopiëren.
7. Aanvullende bepalingen.
"Aanvullende Voorwaarden" zijn bepalingen die de bepalingen van deze Licentie
aanvullen door het maken van uitzonderingen op een of meerdere voorwaarden van
deze Licentie. Aanvullende Voorwaarden die op het gehele Programma van toepassing
zijn, zullen worden behandeld alsof zij onderdeel zijn van deze Licentie, voorzover zij
geldig zijn onder het toepasselijke recht. Als Aanvullende Voorwaarden slechts van
toepassing zijn op een deel van het Programma, dan mag dat deel apart worden
gebruikt onder die voorwaarden, maar het Programma als geheel blijft onderworpen aan
deze Licentie zonder dat acht hoeft te worden geslagen op de Aanvullende
Voorwaarden.
Als je een kopie van een GPL v.3 Werk Overbrengt, mag je er voor kiezen om alle
Aanvullende Voorwaarden van die kopie of van een deel van die kopie te verwijderen.
(Aanvullende Voorwaarden kunnen zo worden geschreven dat zij hun eigen verwijdering
vereisen in bepaalde gevallen als je het werk Wijzigt.) Je mag Aanvullende
Voorwaarden toevoegen voor materiaal dat jij zelf toevoegt aan een GPL v.3 Werk en
waarvoor jij de benodigde auteursrechtelijke toestemming hebt of kunt geven.
Niettegenstaande enige andere bepaling van deze Licentie is het je met betrekking tot
materiaal dat jij toevoegt (indien toegestaan door de auteursrechthebbenden op dat
materiaal) aan een GPL v.3 Werk, toegestaan de bepalingen van deze Licentie aan te
vullen met bepalingen: 
• a) die de garantie uitsluiten of de aansprakelijkheid beperken op een andere
wijze dan Artikelen 15 en 16 van deze Licentie; of
• b) die instandhouding vereisen van specifieke, redelijke juridische
kennisgevingen of auteursvermeldingen in dat materiaal of in de Passende
Juridische Kennisgevingen die weergegeven worden door werken die het
bevatten; of
• c) die een verkeerde voorstelling van de oorsprong van dat materiaal verbieden,
of vereisen dat aangepaste versies van dat materiaal op een redelijke wijze
worden gemarkeerd als verschillend van de oorspronkelijke versie; of
• d) die het gebruik van de namen van de licentiegevers of auteurs van het
materiaal voor publiciteitsdoeleinden beperken; of
• e) die een weigering inhouden merkenrechtelijke rechten te verschaffen voor het
gebruik van sommige handelsnamen, merken of dienstmerken; of
• f) die schadeloosstelling van de licentiegevers en de auteurs van dat materiaal
vereisen van eenieder die dat materiaal (of aangepaste versies daarvan)
Overbrengt met contractuele bepalingen over de aansprakelijkheid jegens de
ontvanger, voor iedere aansprakelijkheid die als een direct gevolg van die
contractuele bepalingen op die licentiegevers en auteurs rust.
Alle verdere beperkende Aanvullende Voorwaarden worden beschouwd als “Verdere
Beperkingen” in de zin van artikel 10. Als het Programma in de vorm waarin jij het kreeg
of een deel daarvan, een kennisgeving bevat die stelt dat het wordt beheerst door deze
Licentie en een Verdere Beperking, dan mag je die Verdere Beperking verwijderen. Als
een licentiedocument een Verdere Beperking bevat maar toestaat dat er wordt geherlicentieerd
of Overgebracht onder deze Licentie, mag je aan een GPL v.3 Werk
materiaal toevoegen dat beheerst wordt door dat licentiedocument, op voorwaarde dat
die Verdere Beperking dergelijk herlicentiëren of Overbrengen niet overleeft.
Als je voorwaarden toevoegt aan een GPL v.3 Werk in overeenstemming met dit artikel,
dan moet je in de relevante broncodebestanden een kennisgeving over de op die
bestanden toepasselijke aanvullende bepalingen opnemen, of een kennisgeving die
naar een vindplaats voor de toepasselijke voorwaarden verwijst.
Aanvullende bepalingen, of ze nu beperkend of niet-beperkend zijn, kunnen in de vorm
van een aparte, geschreven licentie worden gesteld of als uitzonderingen; de
bovenstaande eisen gelden voor beide vormen.
8. Beëindiging
Je mag geen GPL v.3 Werk verspreiden of Wijzigen op een andere wijze dan
uitdrukkelijk is toegestaan onder deze Licentie. Elke andere poging om een GPL v.3
Werk te verspreiden of te Wijzigen is nietig en zal automatisch je rechten onder deze
Licentie beëindigen (waaronder elke toegekende octrooilicentie in de zin van artikel 11,
derde paragraaf). 
Echter, als je stopt met handelen in strijd met deze Licentie, zal jouw licentie van een
bepaalde auteursrechthebbende weer in werking treden (a) op voorlopige basis, tenzij
en totdat de auteursrechthebbende expliciet en definitief jouw licentie beëindigt, en (b)
definitief, als de auteursrechthebbende nalaat jou op gepaste wijze kennisgeving te
doen van de overtreding binnen een periode van 60 dagen nadat de overtreding
gestaakt is.
Bovendien is jouw licentie van een bepaalde auteursrechthebbende definitief hersteld
als de auteursrechthebbende jou op gepaste wijze kennisgeving doet van de
overtreding, dit de eerste keer is dat je een kennisgeving met betrekking tot overtreding
van deze Licentie (voor welk werk dan ook) ontvangt en je deze overtreding rechtzet
voordat 30 dagen zijn verstreken na de ontvangst van de kennisgeving.
Beëindiging van jouw rechten in de zin van dit artikel, beëindigt niet de licenties van
partijen die kopieën of rechten van jou hebben gekregen onder deze Licentie. Als jouw
rechten zijn beëindigd en niet definitief hersteld, kom je niet in aanmerking om nieuwe
licenties te verkrijgen voor hetzelfde materiaal bedoeld onder artikel 10.
9. Aanvaarding niet vereist voor het hebben van kopieën.
Om een kopie van het Programma te ontvangen of te draaien is het niet nodig deze
Licentie te aanvaarden. Voor andere verspreiding van een GPL v.3 Werk dat uitsluitend
voortvloeit uit het gebruik van peer-to-peer transmissie met als doel een kopie van dit
Werk te ontvangen is evenmin aanvaarding van de Licentie nodig. Echter, uitsluitend op
grond van deze Licentie verkrijg je toestemming om een GPL v.3 Werk te Verspreiden of
te Wijzigen. Deze handelingen maken inbreuk op auteursrechten in het geval je deze
Licentie niet aanvaardt. Hieruit volgt dat door te Wijzigen of te Verspreiden je aangeeft
dat je deze Licentie aanvaardt.
10. Automatische licentiering aan latere verkrijgers.
Elke keer dat jij een GPL v.3 Werk Overbrengt, verkrijgt de ontvanger automatisch een
licentie van de eerdere licentiegevers om het werk draaien, Wijzigen en te verspreiden
onder de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. Jij bent niet verantwoordelijk voor het
afdwingen van de naleving door derden van deze Licentie.
Een “Rechtspersonen-transactie” is een transactie waarbij (i) de zeggenschap over een
organisatie wordt overgedragen, (ii) bijna alle activa van een organisatie worden
overgedragen, (iii) een organisatie in delen wordt opgesplitst, of (iv) organisaties worden
samengevoegd. Als een Rechtspersonen-transactie resulteert in verspreiding van een
GPL v.3 Werk, zal elk van de partijen bij die transactie die een kopie van het werk
verkrijgt, ook alle aan het werk verbonden licenties verkrijgen die de rechtsvoorganger
van die partij had of kon geven onder de voorwaarden van de voorgaande paragraaf,
inclusief het recht op de Corresponderende Broncode van het werk dat zich onder die
rechtsvoorganger bevond, indien die rechtsvoorganger het heeft of met redelijke
inspanningen kan krijgen.
Je mag geen Verdere Beperkingen opleggen op de uitoefening van de rechten die onder
deze Licentie worden verkregen of bevestigd. Bijvoorbeeld, je mag geen
licentievergoeding, royalty of andere vergoeding voor de uitoefening van rechten die 
onder deze Licentie worden verkregen opleggen, en je mag geen juridische procedures
instellen (waaronder een eis in reconventie in een procedure) waarbij je stelt dat er
inbreuk op een octrooiconclusie wordt gemaakt door het maken, gebruiken verkopen,
aanbieden en/of importeren van het Programma of een deel hiervan.
11. Octrooien.
Een “Bijdragende Partij” is een auteursrechthebbende die het gebruik van het
Programma of een werk waarop het Programma is gebaseerd onder de voorwaarden
van deze Licentie toestaat. Het werk dat op die manier wordt gelicentieerd wordt de
“Versie van de Bijdragende Partij” genoemd.
De “Essentiële Octrooiconclusies” van een Bijdragende Partij zijn alle octrooiconclusies
die de Bijdragende Partij in eigendom heeft of waarover hij zeggenschap heeft, of ze nu
al zijn verkregen of later worden verkregen, waarop inbreuk zou worden gemaakt door
een vorm van het compileren, gebruiken of verkopen van de Versie van de Bijdragende
Partij die onder deze Licentie is toegestaan, maar omvat niet die conclusies waarop
alleen inbreuk zou worden gemaakt als gevolg van verdere Wijziging van de Versie van
de Bijdragende partij. “Zeggenschap” in de zin van deze definitie omvat ook het recht om
octrooi-sublicenties te geven op een wijze die strookt met de vereisten van deze
Licentie.
Elke Bijdragende Partij geeft jou een niet-exclusieve, wereldwijde, royaltyvrije,
octrooilicentie voor zijn Essentiële Octrooiconclusies, om de inhoud van de Versie van
de Bijdragende partij te compileren, gebruiken, verkopen, aanbieden, importeren en op
enigerlei andere wijze te draaien, Wijzigen en te Verspreiden.
In de volgende drie paragrafen is een “Octrooilicentie” een uitdrukkelijke overeenkomst
of verbintenis, hoe deze ook wordt betiteld, om een octrooi niet te handhaven (zoals een
nadrukkelijke toestemming om octrooi toe te passen of een afspraak om iemand niet in
rechte te betrekken voor octrooi-inbreuk). Het “Geven” van een dergelijke Octrooilicentie
aan een partij omvat het aangaan van een dergelijke overeenkomst of verbintenis om
een octrooi niet te handhaven tegen die partij.
Als je een GPL v.3 Werk Overbrengt, wetende dat het gebruik maakt van een
Octrooilicentie, en de Corresponderende Broncode van het werk is niet voor iedereen
beschikbaar om het kosteloos en onder de voorwaarden van deze Licentie te kopiëren,
door middel van een publiek toegankelijke netwerk server of een anderszins eenvoudig
bereikbare middel, dan moet je ofwel (1) er voor zorgen dat de Corresponderende
Broncode op die wijze beschikbaar wordt, of (2) er voor zorgen dat jij zelf het voordeel
van deze specifieke octrooilicentie verliest, of (3) er voor zorgen, op een wijze die strookt
met de vereisten van deze Licentie, dat de Octrooilicentie zich ook uitstrekt tot de
opvolgende verkrijgers. “Wetende” wil zeggen dat je daadwerkelijk weet dat, als je die
Octrooilicentie niet zou hebben, jouw Overbrengen van het GPL v.3 Werk in een land, of
het gebruik van het GPL v.3 Werk door jouw ontvanger in een land, inbreuk zou maken
op een of meer specifieke octrooien in dat land, waarvan jij reden hebt om aan te nemen
dat het geldige octrooien zijn.
Als je in verband met een individuele transactie of regeling een GPL v.3 Werk
overbrengt of verspreidt door het verzorgen van doorgifte en je aan de ontvangers van 
het GPL v.3 Werk een octrooilicentie verschaft die het hen toestaat een specifieke kopie
van het GPL v.3 Werk te gebruiken, verspreiden, Wijzigen of over te brengen, dan geldt
die Octrooilicentie die je geeft automatisch voor alle ontvangers van het GPL v.3 Werk
en alle werken die daarop worden gebaseerd.
Een Octrooilicentie is “Discriminerend” als het een of meer rechten die specifiek onder
deze Licentie worden verschaft niet in haar voorwaarden heeft staan, de uitoefening
daarvan verbiedt of gegeven wordt onder de ontbindende voorwaarde dat men die
rechten niet uitoefent. Je mag geen GPL v.3 Werk Overbrengen als je een partij bent bij
een regeling met een derde die bedrijfsmatig software distribueert, onder welke regeling
jij die derde een vergoeding betaalt die gerelateerd is aan de mate waarin jij het werk
Overbrengt, en waaronder die derde aan elke partij die het GPL v.3 Werk van jou
ontvangt een Discriminerende Octrooilicentie (a) voor de kopieën van het GPL v.3 Werk
dat jij hebt doorgegeven (of kopieën van die kopieën), of (b) hoofdzakelijk voor en
verband houdend met specifieke producten of compilaties die het GPL v.3 Werk
omvatten, tenzij je die verbintenis bent aangegaan, of die licentie gegeven is voor 28
maart 2007.
Niets in deze Licentie mag worden uitgelegd als een uitsluiting of beperking van enige
impliciete licentie of van andere verweren die jou overigens onder het toepasselijk
octrooirecht ter beschikking kunnen staan.
12. Geen beperking van andermans vrijheid.
Als jou voorwaarden zijn opgelegd (door gerechtelijk bevel, overeenkomst of anderszins)
die in tegenspraak zijn met de voorwaarden van deze Licentie, ben je toch nog steeds
gebonden aan de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. Als je geen GPL v.3 Werk kunt
Overbrengen om zo tegelijkertijd te voldoen aan je verplichtingen onder deze Licentie en
aan enige andere toepasselijke verplichtingen, dan mag je als gevolg daarvan het werk
helemaal niet meer Overbrengen. Bijvoorbeeld, als je instemt met verplichtingen op
grond waarvan je een royalty moet innen van de ontvangers voor het verder
Overbrengen van het Programma, dan is de enige manier waarop je zowel aan die
verplichtingen en deze Licentie kunt voldoen, je volledig onthouden van het
Overbrengen van het Programma.
13. Gebruik met de GNU Affero Algemene Publieke Licentie.
Onverminderd elke andere bepaling van deze Licentie, heb je toestemming om elk GPL
v.3 Werk te linken naar of te combineren met een werk dat is gelicentieerd onder versie
3 van de GNU Affero Algemene Publieke Licentie waardoor een enkel gecombineerd
werk ontstaat, en dit werk over te brengen. De bepalingen van deze Licentie zullen van
toepassing blijven op het GPL v.3 Werk, maar de speciale vereisten van artikel 13 van
de GNU Affero Algemene Publieke Licentie, met betrekking tot interactie met behulp van
een netwerk, zullen van toepassing zijn op het gecombineerde werk.
14. Herziene versies van deze Licentie.
De Free Software Foundation kan zo nu en dan herziene en/of nieuwe versies
publiceren van de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie. Zulke nieuwe versies zullen in 
dezelfde geest zijn opgesteld als de huidige versie, maar kunnen in de details afwijken
om nieuwe problemen of zorgen aan te pakken.
Elke versie krijgt een onderscheidend versienummer. Als het Programma specificeert
dat een bepaald genummerde versie van de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie “of elke
latere versie” van toepassing is, heb je de mogelijkheid om overeenkomstig de
bepalingen van die genummerde versie ofwel die van elke latere versie die is
gepubliceerd door de Free Software Foundation te handelen. Als het Programma niet
een versienummer van de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie specificeert, mag je elke
versie kiezen die ooit is gepubliceerd door de Free Software Foundation.
Als het Programma specificeert dat een gemachtigde kan besluiten welke toekomstige
versies van de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie kunnen worden gebruikt, dan biedt de
publieke aanvaarding van een bepaalde versie door die gemachtigde jou permanent de
mogelijkheid die versie te kiezen voor het Programma.
Latere versies van de licentie kunnen jou aanvullende of andere rechten verschaffen.
Echter, geen aanvullende verplichtingen worden opgelegd aan enige auteur of
auteursrechthebbende als een gevolg van jouw keuze om een latere versie te kiezen.
15. Afwijzing van garantie.
ER WORDEN GEEN GARANTIES GEGEVEN VOOR HET PROGRAMMA VOOR
ZOVER TOEGESTAAN DOOR DE TOEPASSELIJKE REGELGEVING. BEHALVE
WANNEER DIT ANDERSZINS SCHRIFTELIJK IS BEVESTIGD, BIEDEN DE
AUTEURSRECHTHEBBENDEN EN/OF ANDERE PARTIJEN DIT PROGRAMMA
ZOALS HET IS AAN ZONDER ENIGE GARANTIES, EXPLICIET OF IMPLICIET,
WAARONDER MAAR NIET HIERTOE BEPERKT DE IMPLICIETE GARANTIES DIE
GEBRUIKELIJK ZIJN IN DE HANDEL EN BRUIKBAARHEID VOOR EEN SPECIFIEK
DOEL. HET VOLLEDIGE RISICO MET BETREKKING TOT DE KWALITEIT EN DE
PRESTATIES VAN HET PROGRAMMA RUST BIJ JOU. ALS HET PROGRAMMA
GEBREKKIG BLIJKT TE ZIJN, DIEN JIJ ALLE NOODZAKELIJKE SERVICE-,
REPARATIE- OF CORRECTIEKOSTEN OP JE TE NEMEN.
16. Beperking van aansprakelijkheid.
IN GEEN GEVAL, TENZIJ VEREIST DOOR DE TOEPASSELIJKE REGELGEVING OF
SCHRIFTELIJK OVEREENGEKOMEN, ZAL ENIGE AUTEURSRECHTHEBBENDE, OF
ENIGE ANDERE PARTIJ DIE HET PROGRAMMA WIJZIGT EN/OF OVERBRENGT
OVEREENKOMSTIG DE HIERVOOR GEGEVEN TOESTEMMING, AANSPRAKELIJK
ZIJN JEGENS JOU VOOR SCHADE INCLUSIEF ELKE ALGEMENE, SPECIALE,
INCIDENTELE OF GEVOLGSCHADE DIE VOORTVLOEIT UIT HET GEBRUIK OF HET
ONVERMOGEN OM HET PROGRAMMA TE GEBRUIKEN (INCLUSIEF MAAR NIET
BEPERKT TOT HET VERLIES VAN DATA OF INACCURATE GELEVERDE DATA OF
DOOR JOU OF DERDE PARTIJEN GELEDEN VERLIEZEN OF EEN STORING VAN
HET PROGRAMMA OM SAMEN TE WERKEN MET ANDERE PROGRAMMA’S),
ZELFS ALS EEN DERGELIJKE AUTEURSRECHTHEBBENDE OF ANDERE PARTIJ IS
GEWEZEN OP DE MOGELIJKHEID VAN ZULKE SCHADE. 
17. Uitleg van artikelen 15 en 16.
Als de afwijzing van garantie en beperking van aansprakelijkheid zoals hiervoor gegeven
onder nationale regelgeving niet het beoogde juridisch effect heeft, zal de behandelende
rechtbank het nationale recht toepassen dat de absolute afstand van alle civielrechtelijke
aansprakelijkheid in relatie tot het Programma zoveel mogelijk benadert, tenzij een
garantie of aanname van aansprakelijkheid tegen een vergoeding bij een kopie van het
Programma is inbegrepen.
EINDE VAN DE ALGEMENE VOORWAARDEN
Hoe deze voorwaarden moeten worden toegepast op jouw nieuwe programma’s
Als jij een nieuw programma ontwikkelt en je wilt dat het van het grootst mogelijke nut is
voor het publiek, kun je dit het beste doen door het vrije software te maken die door
iedereen kan worden ge-herdistribueerd en gewijzigd onder deze voorwaarden.
Dat doe je door de volgende kennisgeving aan het programma toe te voegen.2
 Het is het
veiligste om ze aan het begin van elk Broncode bestand op te nemen om zo op de
meest effectieve wijze elke aansprakelijkheid uit te sluiten; en elk bestand zou tenminste
de “auteursrecht”-regel moeten hebben en een verwijzing naar een plek waar de
volledige kennisgeving gevonden kan worden.
<een regel om de naam van het programma weer te geven en een korte
omschrijving van wat het programma doet.>
Auteursrecht (C) <jaar> <naam van de auteur>
Dit programma is vrije software: je mag het herdistribueren en/of wijzigen onder
de voorwaarden van de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie zoals gepubliceerd
door de Free Software Foundation, onder versie 3 van de Licentie of (naar jouw
keuze) elke latere versie.
Dit programma is gedistribueerd in de hoop dat het nuttig zal zijn maar ZONDER
ENIGE GARANTIE; zelfs zonder de impliciete garanties die GEBRUIKELIJK
ZIJN IN DE HANDEL of voor BRUIKBAARHEID VOOR EEN SPECIFIEK DOEL.
Zie de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie voor meer details.
Je hoort een kopie van de GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie te hebben
ontvangen samen met dit programma. Als dat niet het geval is, zie
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Voeg ook informatie toe over hoe je bereikt kan worden via e-mail en papieren post.
Als het programma communiceert via een terminal, zorg er dan voor dat het een korte
mededeling weergeeft zoals hieronder wanneer het start in een interactieve modus:
2
 Noot van de vertalers: deze kennisgevingen moeten worden gedaan door de oorspronkelijke, Engelse
tekst toe te voegen. 
<programma> Auteursrecht (C) <jaar> <naam van de maker>
Er zit ABSOLUUT GEEN GARANTIE op dit programma; tik voor meer informatie
‘show w’.
Dit is vrije software en je bent van harte uitgenodigd om het te herdistribueren
onder bepaalde voorwaarden; tik `show c’ voor meer informatie.
De hypothetische commando’s ‘show w’ en ‘show c’ dienen de gepaste delen van de
Algemene Publieke Licentie te tonen. Natuurlijk zijn jouw programmacommando’s
misschien anders; voor een GUI interface, gebruik je een “about box”.
Je moet er ook voor zorgen dat jouw werkgever (als je werkt als een programmeur) of
school, voor zover relevant, een “afstand van auteursrecht-verklaring” met betrekking tot
het programma tekent. Voor meer informatie hierover en hoe je de GNU GPL kunt
toepassen en naleven, zie <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
De GNU Algemene Publieke Licentie staat niet toe dat jouw programma wordt
opgenomen in gesloten software. Als jouw programma een subroutine library is, kan je
overwegen om het linken van gesloten software naar deze library toe te staan. Als dit is
wat je wilt doen, gebruik dan de GNU Mindere Algemene Publieke Licentie in plaats van
deze Licentie. M

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.
The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.
Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.
Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
                            Preamble
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
                            NO WARRANTY
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice
That's all there is to it!

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
  0. Additional Definitions.
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
  4. Combined Works.
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
   d) Do one of the following:
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
  5. Combined Libraries.
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

META-SHARE IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. 
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN AGENT-CLIENT 
RELATIONSHIP. META-SHARE PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" 
BASIS. META-SHARE MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE 
INFORMATION PROVIDED WITH REGARDS TO THE LICENCES, AND DISCLAIMS 
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE. 
META-SHARE Commercial NoRedistribution Licence 
(MS C-NoReD) 
The Licensor <Name>, <Organisation>, <Address>, <Email>, and 
Licensee (You) <Name>, <Organisation>, <Address>, <Email>, agree that this 
META-SHARE Licence enables You to Use the Resource worldwide under the 
terms and conditions specified hereafter: 
1. Definitions of Capitalised Words 
a. Attribution Data" means a field of metadata accompanying every resource, 
containing a specified string of characters to be used for attribution of the 
Resource. 
b. "Collective Work" means a work made up of the Resource in its entirety in 
unmodified form, along with other work, assembled into a collective whole. 
Both the Resource and any other work remain unmodified in the Collective 
Work and hence do not constitute a derivative work. 
c. "Derivative" means any material that Uses the Resource (or any substantial 
part of it) in any material form whatsoever (such as a translation, dramatisation 
or abridgment), other than (i) as a whole and in unmodified form or (ii) by 
modifying it as may be technically necessary to Use it in a different mode or 
format; but a Collective Work is not a Derivative for the purpose of this Licence. 
d. "Derogatory Treatment" means a treatment which distorts or mutilates the 
Resource or is otherwise prejudicial to the honour or reputation of the Original 
Author or the Licensor. 
e. "Licensee" means the Person accepting the Resource under the terms and 
conditions of this Licence. 


f. "Licensor" means the Person offering the Resource under the terms and 
conditions of this Licence and is named in the METASHARE metadata. 
g. "META-SHARE" is a network of distributed repositories of LRs. 
h. "Original Author" means the Person who holds any copyright or the sui 
generis Database Right in the Language Resource or any parts of it and is 
named as such in the Attribution Data. 
i. "Person" means a natural person or a body of persons corporate or 
incorporate. In the case of a body of persons, this may only grant access to 
people working under its control, i.e., its own members, consultants to the 
organisation, employees or individuals providing service to the organisation. 
Individuals may be allowed access to the Resource only after being informed of 
the provisions of this Licence. The access is to be terminated when the license 
no longer applies. The organisation will take all reasonable steps to retain the 
list of all persons ever granted access to the Information and make them 
available upon request to any of the copyright holders licensing this work. 
j. "Resource" means the specific language resource <RESOURCE NAME>, 
<RESOURCE SHORT NAME> offered to You under the terms of this Licence. 
k. “Site” means the premises of <PREMISES NAME OR DESCRIPTION> where 
the Resource will be used, which is under Your control , including but not 
limited to geographical location, specific computing equipment, IP addresses or 
any other point of access controlled by the licensee. 
l. "Use", as a verb, means doing any act which is restricted by copyright or 
neighbouring rights (including Database Rights), whether in the original 
medium or any other; and includes modifying the Resource as may be 
technically necessary to Use it in a different mode or format. 
m. "Work" means any work protected by copyright (or by database rights if 
applicable) which is offered under the terms of this Licence, and includes works 
forming only a part of the Resource as well works as incorporated in any 
Collective Work. 
n. "You" means the Person acquiring rights under this Licence. 
o. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. 

2. The Rights Granted 

2.1 Subject to the exceptions under clause 2.2, the conditions and the reservation 
under clauses 2.3-2.8 below, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, clear of any third 
parties rights, non-exclusive, licence to Use the Resource under the terms and 
conditions defined here. This licence covers the copyright and the sui generis database 
right over the Resource and is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to 
the Resource. For the purpose of this Licence, Use is encompassing all acts described 
below, in the execution of which only You are involved and only if the use is necessary 
to access and make the agreed use of the contents of the Resource. 
So you may: 
a. copy the Resource, create Derivatives or incorporate the Resource or the 
Derivatives into a Collective Work; 
b. extract and re-utilise the whole or substantial parts of the Resource; copy 
Derivatives or the Resource as incorporated in any Collective Work; 
c. may distribute and market any derivative product or service based on all or a 
substantial part of the Resource 

You may perform any of the above acts by any means and in any medium whether now 
known or created in the future and for any purpose or in any way, including purposes 
primarily intended for commercial advantage or payment, other than the ones provided 
under 2.2. 
2.2 However, this Licence does not allow You to: 

a. Use the Resource outside Your site 
b. Use the Resource in any other way other than as necessary or desirable for the 
purposes of Your own internal language engineering research activities or Your 
own internal technology development, 
c. Make available to the public all or any substantial part of the contents of the 
Resource, by the distribution of copies, by renting, leasing or any other form of 
distribution, including inclusion in a collective work or providing a derivative 
out of which the original work may be identified and used as well as any free or 
open-source distribution forms; 
d. make products or services available to third parties in any form that allows to 
reconstruct the original Resource; 
e. sublicense the Resource; or 


f. subject the Resource to Derogatory Treatment. 

2.3 If requested by the licensor You must, in the case You publish or distribute any 
Derivative to anyone in any way, give reasonable credit to the Original Author or owner 
of the sui generis database as prescribed in the Attribution Data. 
This is an important condition of this Licence, and if You fail to comply with it You will 
be in material breach of its terms. 
2.4 The Original Author asserts the right to be identified as the original author of 
the Work, as forming part of the Resource, if applicable; but only as and when required 
by clause 2.3 above. 
2.5 You may also, if You publish or distribute any Derivative to anyone under the 
terms of this Licence and in any way provide the relevant meta-data to the META-
SHARE network, so that for instance, the indexing of the Derivative Work is possible. 
These are important conditions of this Licence, and if You fail to comply with them You 
will be in material breach of its terms. 
2.6 This license is offered to You free of charge. 
2.7 You may create Derivatives as necessary or desirable for the purposes of Your 
own internal language engineering research activities. All rights granted hereunder are 
perpetual, and worldwide. 
2.8 In addition to the above: 
a. the right to release the Resource under different terms, or to stop distributing 
the Resource, is reserved; 
b. all other rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved; and 
c. You must attribute the Resource by ensuring all Attribution Data accompany 
the Resource. 

2.9 This Licence does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may 
independently have under any applicable law (including fair dealing, fair use, or any 
other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement) to make any 
Use of this Resource. 

2.10 This Licence does not allow You to claim any endorsement or approval by the 
Licensor or the Original Author or Your use of the Resource without their express 
written permission. 
2.11 You and the Licensor are independent contractors. Nothing contained in this 
Licence shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, a 
partnership or a Joint Venture between You and the Licensor. 
3. Warranties and Disclaimer 
The Resource is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any warranty of any kind, 
either express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy, of fitness for purpose, or 
otherwise. 
4. Limit of Liability 
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor shall 
not be liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and 
whenever caused to anyone by any Use under this Licence, whether by You or by 
anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. If 
liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to 
the extent it is caused by proved gross negligence on the part of the Licensor. 
5. Termination 
5.1 Any breach by You of the terms of this licence (for example, by distributing the 
Resource) entitles the Licensor to send You a termination notice within 15 days from 
the breach. You are entitled to provide a written objection to this notice within 15 days 
and in case there is no acceptance by the Licensor the termination takes effect within 15 
days of Your response. 
5.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this licence, the Licensor may not 
terminate Your rights under it. 
5.3 Unless terminated under clause 5.1, this Licence is granted to You for the 
duration of any rights in the Resource as mentioned in 2. above. 
6. General 
6.1 If any provision of this Licence is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that shall 
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence. 

6.2 This Licence is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
Resource licensed here. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or 
representations with respect to the Resource not specified here. 
6.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this Licence (for example, by distributing the 
Resource) You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this Licence or to complain of 
any breach by the Licensor. 
6.4 In case of any dispute arising in relation to the License, the competent courts 
are those of [COUNTRY NAME] and the applicable laws are those of [COUNTRY 
NAME]. 
 
The Licensor: 
 
The Licensee: 
 
 
 
The Notice below is not part of this licence. 
META-SHARE NOTICE 
META-SHARE is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in 
connection with the Resource. META-SHARE will not be liable to You or any party on 
any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, 
special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this licence. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if META-SHARE has expressly 
identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of 
Licensor. 

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Resource is licensed 
under the META-SHARE Licence, neither party will use the trademark "META-
SHARE" or any related trademark or logo of META-SHARE without the prior written 
consent of META-SHARE. Any permitted use will be in compliance with META-
SHARE's then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website 
or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

Use of this Resource.

Licensor or the Original Author of You or your use of the Resource without their 
express written permission.

the extent it is caused by proved gross negligence on the part of the Licensor. 
5. Termination 

META-SHARE Commons BY_NC_ND v1.0 5 
5.1 Any breach by You of the terms of this licence (for example, by distributing the 
Resource without attributing as appropriate) entitles the Licensor to terminate your 
Licence with immediate effect and without notice to you. Persons who have received

their licences terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this Licence or a 
licence granted under clause 2.6 of this Licence.

terminate your rights under it. 
5.3 Unless terminated under clause 5.1, this Licence is granted to you for the

6. General 
6.1 If any provision of this Licence is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that shall 
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence.

Resource licensed here but hereby allows for additional agreements that grant more 
rights than this License. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or 
representations with respect to the Resource not specified here. 
6.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this Licence (for example, by distributing the 
Resource without attributing as appropriate) you will not be entitled to rely on the 
terms of this Licence or to complain of any breach by the Licensor. 
6.4 If there is any dispute as to the meaning or effect of any provision of this 
Licence, it must so far as possible be read and given effect in a way that is compatible 
with the provisions of any subsequent version of the META-SHARE Commons licence, 
which has the same Licence Elements. 
6.5 As far as arbitration processes have been established within META-SHARE, any 
dispute arising in connection with this Licence or the Resource has to adhere to these 
processes before being filed at public justice bodies.

ODC Attribution License (ODC-By)
Preamble
The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database subject only to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4.
Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish to use this license together with another license for the contents.
Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.
The Licensor (as defined below)
and
You (as defined below)
agree as follows:
1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words
“Collective Database” – Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.
“Convey” – As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.
“Contents” – The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.
“Database” – A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License.
“Database Directive” – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded.
“Database Right” – Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (“sui generis”) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.
“Derivative Database” – Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.
“Extraction” – Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.
“License” – Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.
“Licensor” – Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this License.
“Person” – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.
“Produced Work” – a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.
“Publicly” – means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).
“Re-utilisation” – means any form of making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission.
“Substantial” – Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.
“Use” – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.
“You” – Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.
2.0 What this License covers
2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:
a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;
b. A license of the Database Right; and
c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.
2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database, including:
a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the Database;
b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and
c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this access as outlined in this License.
2.3 Rights not covered.
a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database;
b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database; and
c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the Database.
2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the images.
3.0 Rights granted
3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future.
The rights granted cover, for example:
a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents;
b. Creation of Derivative Databases;
c. Creation of Collective Databases;
d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and
e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective Databases.
3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:
a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.
4.0 Conditions of Use
4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material breach of its terms.
4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:
a. Do so only under the terms of this License;
b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;
c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License; and
d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.
4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License.
a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:
    Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available
    under the ODC Attribution License.
DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to the location of the Database. “ODC Attribution License” should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the required URI’s with the above notice.
4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.
5.0 Moral rights
5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment:
a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;
b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and
c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.
Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some jurisdictions.
6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected
6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Database, including without limitation:
a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.
b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.
6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.
7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer
7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor “as is” and without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.
8.0 Limitation of liability
8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Licensor.
9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License
9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this License.
9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will not terminate Your rights under it.
9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.
9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License will be reinstated:
a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after cessation of breach;
b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or
c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
10.0 General
10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database.
10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the Licensor.
10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License, these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the terms of this License.

The License
Preamble The Open Data Commons – Public Domain Dedication & Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This licence is intended for use on databases or their contents (“data”), either together or individually.
Many databases are covered by copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe, have specific special rights that cover databases called the “sui generis” database right. Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a limited amount of rights under a “some rights reserved” approach to licensing as outlined in the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a result, this waiver and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and data. Any Community Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or other terms of use for the database or data.
The position of the recipient of the work
Because this document places the database and its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain, there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by this document. Recipients may use this work commercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database with other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep them secret. It is not a requirement that recipients provide further users with a copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of the data or database as a source. The goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on the use of it by others.
The position of the dedicator of the work
Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of “intellectual property”, is inherently national law. This means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims.
The purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free cultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be able to “dual license” their work by releasing the same work under different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can’t re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts.
This document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the data). Because databases can have a wide variety of content – not just factual data – rightsholders should use the Open Data Commons – Public Domain Dedication & Licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can sometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this licence to cover both the database and its factual data when making material available under this document; even if it is likely that the data would not be covered by copyright or database rights.
Rightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do this because this document refers to the “Work”, which can be either – or both – the database and its contents. As a result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document when they dedicate it.
Just like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns. Please ensure that the rights have been cleared to make this material available under this document.
This document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work available to the public for any use of any kind, and it should not be used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen.
Part I: Introduction
The Rightsholder (the Person holding rights or claims over the Work) agrees as follows:
1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words
“Copyright” – Includes rights under copyright and under neighbouring rights and similarly related sets of rights under the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4.
“Data” – The contents of the Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database offered under the terms of this Document.
“Database” – A collection of Data arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this Document.
“Database Right” – Means rights over Data resulting from the Chapter III (“sui generis”) rights in the Database Directive (Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases) and any future updates as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4.
“Document” – means this relinquishment and waiver of rights and claims and back up licence agreement.
“Person” – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.
“Use” – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by Copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes modifying the Work as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format. This includes the right to sublicense the Work.
“Work” – Means either or both of the Database and Data offered under the terms of this Document.
“You” – the Person acquiring rights under the licence elements of this Document.
Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.
2.0 What this document covers
2.1. Legal effect of this Document. This Document is:
a. A dedication to the public domain and waiver of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work; and
b. A licence of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work in jurisdictions that do not allow for relinquishment or waiver.
2.2. Legal rights covered.
a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Work. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Data stored in the Database. Copyright may also cover the Data depending on the jurisdiction and type of Data; and
b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the extraction and re-utilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the Data. Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Data is removed from the Database and is selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright.
2.2 Rights not covered.
a. This Document does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database;
b. This Document does not cover any patents over the Data or the Database. Please see Section 4.2 later in this Document for further details; and
c. This Document does not cover any trade marks associated with the Database. Please see Section 4.3 later in this Document for further details.
Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences.
2.3 Facts are free. The Rightsholder takes the position that factual information is not covered by Copyright. This Document however covers the Work in jurisdictions that may protect the factual information in the Work by Copyright, and to cover any information protected by Copyright that is contained in the Work.
Part II: Dedication to the public domain
3.0 Dedication, waiver, and licence of Copyright and Database Rights
3.1 Dedication of Copyright and Database Rights to the public domain. The Rightsholder by using this Document, dedicates the Work to the public domain for the benefit of the public and relinquishes all rights in Copyright and Database Rights over the Work.
a. The Rightsholder realises that once these rights are relinquished, that the Rightsholder has no further rights in Copyright and Database Rights over the Work, and that the Work is free and open for others to Use.
b. The Rightsholder intends for their relinquishment to cover all present and future rights in the Work under Copyright and Database Rights, whether they are vested or contingent rights, and that this relinquishment of rights covers all their heirs and successors.
The above relinquishment of rights applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or created in the future.
3.2 Waiver of rights and claims in Copyright and Database Rights when Section 3.1 dedication inapplicable. If the dedication in Section 3.1 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder waives any rights and claims that the Rightsholder may have or acquire in the future over the Work in:
a. Copyright; and
b. Database Rights.
To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, the above waiver of rights and claims applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or created in the future. The Rightsholder agrees not to assert the above rights and waives the right to enforce them over the Work.
3.3 Licence of Copyright and Database Rights when Sections 3.1 and 3.2 inapplicable. If the dedication and waiver in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder and You agree as follows:
a. The Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, licence to Use the Work for the duration of any applicable Copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future.
3.4 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including the right to be identified as the author of the Work or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment:
a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Work to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4;
b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 3.4 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Work and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4; and
c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 3.4 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over the copyrighted aspects of the Work.
Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the work in some jurisdictions.
4.0 Relationship to other rights
4.1 No other contractual conditions. The Rightsholder makes this Work available to You without any other contractual obligations, either express or implied. Any Community Norms statement associated with the Work is not a contract and does not form part of this Document.
4.2 Relationship to patents. This Document does not grant You a licence for any patents that the Rightsholder may own. Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences.
4.3 Relationship to trade marks. This Document does not grant You a licence for any trade marks that the Rightsholder may own or that the Rightsholder may use to cover the Work. Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences. Part III: General provisions
5.0 Warranties, disclaimer, and limitation of liability
5.1 The Work is provided by the Rightsholder “as is” and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy or completeness, of the presence of absence of errors, of fitness for purpose, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.
5.2 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Rightsholder is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this Document, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Rightsholder or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages. This exclusion applies even if the Rightsholder has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
5.3 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Rightsholder.
6.0 General
6.1 If any provision of this Document is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Document.
6.2 This Document is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work covered here. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.
6.3 This Document does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Work, including (for jurisdictions where this Document is a licence) fair dealing, fair use, database exceptions, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.
6.4 This Document takes effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the Document terms are sought to be enforced.

ODC Open Database License (ODbL)
Preamble
The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while maintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.
Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.
Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.
The Licensor (as defined below)
and
You (as defined below)
agree as follows:
1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words
“Collective Database” – Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database.
“Convey” – As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs. “Contents” – The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.
“Database” – A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License.
“Database Directive” – Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded.
“Database Right” – Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (“sui generis”) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.
“Derivative Database” – Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.
“Extraction” – Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.
“License” – Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.
“Licensor” – Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this License.
“Person” – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate.
“Produced Work” – a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.
“Publicly” – means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).
“Re-utilisation” – means any form of making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission.
“Substantial” – Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.
“Use” – As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.
“You” – Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.
2.0 What this License covers
2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:
      a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;
      b. A license of the Database Right; and
      c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.
2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database, including:
      a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the Database;
      b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the       Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and
      c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this access as outlined in this License.
2.3 Rights not covered.
      a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database;
      b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database; and
      c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the       Database.
2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the images.
3.0 Rights granted
3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future.
The rights granted cover, for example:
      a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents;
      b. Creation of Derivative Databases;
      c. Creation of Collective Databases;
      d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and
      e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective       Databases.
3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:
      a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
      b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
      c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.
4.0 Conditions of Use
4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material breach of its terms.
4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:
      a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license permitted under Section 4.4;
      b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and
      c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License.
      d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.
4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License.
      a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:
    Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available
    here under the Open Database License (ODbL).
DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to the URI of the Database. “Open Database License” should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the required URI’s with the above notice.
4.4 Share alike.
      a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under the terms of:
           i. This License;
           ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License; or
           iii. A compatible license.
If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.
      b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.
      c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.
      d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.
      e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the authorised proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a compatible license grants You permission to use the compatible license.
4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply in the following:
      a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of the Collective Database;
      b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and
      c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section 4.4.
4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy in a machine readable form of:
      a. The entire Derivative Database; or
      b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.
The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.
4.7 Technological measures and additional terms
      a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to Section 4.7 b.) any terms or any technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights.
      b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (a “Restricted Database”) in contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the Restricted Database:
           i. That is available without additional fee;
           ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights (an “Unrestricted Database”); and
           iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.
      c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights.
4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.
5.0 Moral rights
5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment:
      a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section       10.4;
      b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and
      c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.
Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some jurisdictions.
6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected
6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Database, including without limitation:
      a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.
      b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.
6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.
7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer
7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor “as is” and without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.
8.0 Limitation of liability
8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Licensor.
9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License
9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this License.
9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will not terminate Your rights under it.
9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.
9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License will be reinstated:
      a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after cessation of breach;
      b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or
      c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to be a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.
9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
10.0 General
10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database.
10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the Licensor.
10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License, these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the terms of this License.

Rhoddir anogaeth i chi ddefnyddio ac ailddefnyddio’r Wybodaeth sydd ar gael dan y drwydded hon yn rhydd a hyblyg, gydag ychydig o amodau.
Defnyddio gwybodaeth dan y drwydded hon
Bydd defnyddio deunydd sydd dan hawliau hawlfraint a chronfa ddata sydd ar gael yn benodol dan y drwydded hon (y ‘Wybodaeth’) yn arwydd eich bod yn derbyn y telerau a’r amodau isod.
Mae’r Trwyddedwr yn rhoi trwydded fyd-eang, heb freindal, hyd byth, nad yw’n cau dim allan i chi i ddefnyddio’r Wybodaeth i ddibenion Anfasnachol yn unig yn ddarostyngedig i’r amodau isod.
Nid yw’r drwydded hon yn effeithio ar eich rhyddid dan ddelio teg neu ddefnydd teg neu unrhyw eithriadau a chyfyngiadau hawliau deunydd hawlfraint neu gronfa ddata.
Mae gennych ryddid i:
gopïo, cyhoeddi, dosbarthu a darlledu’r Wybodaeth;
addasu’r Wybodaeth;
cyfuno’r Wybodaeth gyda gwybodaeth arall.
Ni chaniateir i chi:
arfer unrhyw rai o’r hawliau a roddir i chi dan y drwydded hon mewn unrhyw fodd sydd wedi ei bwriadu’n bennaf ar gyfer neu wedi ei chyfeirio tuag at fantais fasnachol neu iawndal ariannol preifat.
Mae’n rhaid i chi, pan fyddwch yn gwneud unrhyw un o’r uchod:
gydnabod ffynhonnell yr Wybodaeth yn eich cynnyrch neu becyn trwy gynnwys neu gysylltu ag unrhyw ddatganiad priodoli a nodwyd gan Ddarparwr(wyr) yr Wybodaeth a, phan fydd hynny’n bosibl, roi dolen i’r drwydded hon;
Os nad yw’r Darparwr Gwybodaeth yn darparu datganiad priodoli penodol, neu os ydych chi’n defnyddio Gwybodaeth gan nifer o Ddarparwyr Gwybodaeth ac aml briodoleddau yn ymarferol yn eich cynnyrch neu becyn, gallwch ddefnyddio’r canlynol:
Yn cynnwys gwybodaeth a drwyddedwyd dan Drwydded Llywodraeth Anfasnachol v1.0.
sicrhau bod unrhyw drwyddedu ymlaen o’r Wybodaeth – er enghraifft o gyfuno â gwybodaeth arall – ar gyfer dibenion Anfasnachol yn unig.
sicrhau nad ydych yn defnyddio’r Wybodaeth mewn modd sy’n awgrymu unrhyw statws swyddogol na bod y Darparwr Gwybodaeth yn eich cefnogi chi na’ch defnydd o’r Wybodaeth;
sicrhau nad ydych yn camarwain eraill neu’n camddehongli’r Wybodaeth na’i ffynhonnell;
sicrhau nad yw’ch defnydd o’r Wybodaeth yn mynd yn groes i'r Ddeddf Diogelu Data 1998 na’r Rheoliadau Preifatrwydd a Chyfathrebu Electronig (Cyfarwyddeb CE) 2003.
Mae’r rhain yn amodau pwysig i’r drwydded hon ac os na fyddwch yn cydymffurfio â nhw neu’n defnyddio’r wybodaeth ar wahân i ar gyfer materion Anfasnachol, bydd yr hawliau a roddir ichi dan y drwydded, neu unrhyw drwydded debyg a roddir gan y Trwyddedwr, yn dod i ben yn awtomatig.
 Eithriadau
Nid yw’r drwydded hon yn cynnwys defnydd o:
ddata personol yn yr Wybodaeth;
Gwybodaeth sydd heb ei chyhoeddi na’i datgelu dan ddeddfwriaeth mynediad at wybodaeth (gan gynnwys y Deddfau Rhyddid Gwybodaeth i’r Deyrnas Unedig a’r Alban) gan neu gyda chaniatâd y Rhoddwr Gwybodaeth;
logos adrannol neu sector cyhoeddus, arwyddeiriau, arfbeisiau ac Arfbeisiau Brenhinol ac eithrio pan fyddant yn rhan ganolog o ddogfen neu set o ddata;

Gwybodaeth sy’n destun hawliau eiddo deallusol eraill, gan gynnwys patentau, nodau masnach, a hawliau dyluniad; a
dogfennau adnabod fel Pasbort Prydeinig.
Dim gwarant
Mae’r Wybodaeth yn cael ei thrwyddedu ‘fel y mae’ ac mae’r Darparwr Gwybodaeth yn eithrio pob cyflwyniad, gwarant, rhwymedigaeth ac atebolrwydd yng nghyswllt yr Wybodaeth i’r graddau mwyaf a ganiateir gan y gyfraith.
Nid yw’r Darparwr Gwybodaeth yn atebol am unrhyw wallau neu ddiffygion yn yr Wybodaeth ac ni fydd yn atebol am unrhyw golled, anaf na niwed o unrhyw fath a achosir trwy ei defnyddio. Nid yw’r Darparwr Gwybodaeth yn gwarantu y bydd yr Wybodaeth yn parhau i gael ei chyflenwi.
Cyfraith Lywodraethol
Mae’r drwydded yn cael ei rheoli gan gyfreithiau’r awdurdodaeth lle mae prif fan busnes y Darparwr Gwybodaeth, oni nodir yn wahanol gan y Darparwr Gwybodaeth.
Diffiniadau
Yn y drwydded hon, mae gan y termau isod yr ystyron canlynol:
Mae ‘Gwybodaeth’
yn golygu gwybodaeth a ddiogelir gan hawlfraint neu gan hawl cronfa ddata (er enghraifft, gweithiau llenyddol a chelfyddydol, cynnwys, data a chod ffynhonnell) a gynigir i’w defnyddio dan delerau’r drwydded hon.
Mae ‘Darparwr Gwybodaeth’
yn golygu’r unigolyn neu sefydliad sy’n darparu’r Wybodaeth dan y drwydded hon.
Mae ‘Trwyddedwr’
yn golygu unrhyw Ddarparwr Gwybodaeth sydd â’r awdurdod i gynnig Gwybodaeth dan amodau’r drwydded hon neu Reolwr Llyfrfa Ei Mawrhydi, sydd â’r awdurdod i gynnig Gwybodaeth yn ddarostyngedig i hawlfraint y Goron a hawliau cronfa ddata’r Goron a Gwybodaeth sy’n ddarostyngedig i hawl hawlfraint a chronfa ddata sydd wedi ei aseinio i’r Goron neu wedi ei gaffael gan y goron dan delerau’r drwydded hon.
Mae ‘Dibenion anfasnachol’
yn golygu nad yw wedi ei fwriadu ar gyfer na’i gyfeirio tuag at fantais fasnachol nac iawndal ariannol preifat. I ddibenion y drwydded hon, nid yw ‘iawndal ariannol preifat’ yn cynnwys cyfnewid Gwybodaeth ar gyfer unrhyw waith hawlfraint arall trwy rannu ffeiliau digidol nac fel arall ar yr amod nad oes taliad o unrhyw iawndal ariannol yng nghyd-destun cyfnewid yr Wybodaeth.
Mae ‘defnydd’
fel berf yn golygu cyflawni unrhyw weithred a gyfyngir gan hawl hawlfraint neu gronfa ddata, boed yn y cyfrwng gwreiddiol neu yn unrhyw gyfrwng arall, ac yn cynnwys heb gyfyngiad dosbarthu, copïo, addasu, neu gyfaddasu fel gall fod yn angenrheidiol i’w ddefnyddio mewn modd neu fformat gwahanol.
Mae ‘chi’ ac ‘eich’
yn golygu’r unigolyn naturiol neu gyfreithiol, neu gorff o unigolion trwy gorfforaeth neu ymgorfforaeth, sy’n cael hawliau dan y drwydded hon.
Ynghylch y Drwydded hon
Datblygodd Rheolwr Llyfrfa Ei Mawrhydi (HMSO) y drwydded hon fel offeryn i alluogi Darparwyr Gwybodaeth yn y sector cyhoeddus i drwyddedu’r defnydd ac ailddefnydd o’u Gwybodaeth dan drwydded gyffredin anfasnachol. Mae’r Rheolwr yn gwahodd cyrff sector cyhoeddus sydd â’u hawliau hawlfraint a chronfa ddata eu hunain i ganiatáu’r defnydd o’u Gwybodaeth dan y drwydded hon ble nad yw trwyddedu dan Drwydded Llywodraeth Agored ddiofyn yn briodol.
Mae gan Reolwr HMSO awdurdod i drwyddedu Gwybodaeth sy’n ddarostyngedig i hawl hawlfraint a hawl cronfa ddata sy’n eiddo i’r Goron.
Hon yw fersiwn 1.0 o’r Drwydded Llywodraeth Anfasnachol. Gall Rheolwr HMSO, o dro i dro, gyhoeddi fersiynau newydd o’r Drwydded Llywodraeth Anfasnachol. Fodd bynnag, gallwch ddal i ddefnyddio’r Wybodaeth a drwyddedwyd dan y fersiwn hon os dymunwch.

The Controller of HMSO has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the Crown.
This is version 1.0 of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. The Controller of HMSO may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. However, you may continue to use Information licensed under this version should you wish to do so.

Preamble
This Simple Public License 2.0 (SimPL-2.0 for short) is a plain language implementation of GPL 2.0.  The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee for all users the freedom to share and change software.  If anyone wonders about the meaning of the SimPL, they should interpret it as consistent with GPL 2.0.
Simple Public License (SimPL) 2.0
The SimPL applies to the software's source and object code and comes with any rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the SimPL by copying, distributing, or making a derivative work of the software.
You get the royalty free right to:
Use the software for any purpose;
Make derivative works of it (this is called a "Derived Work");
Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work.
If you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back to the community by:
Prominently noting the date of any changes you make;
Leaving other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and license terms  in place;
Providing the source code, build scripts, installation scripts, and interface definitions in a form that is easy to get and best to modify;
Licensing it to everyone under SimPL, or substantially similar terms (such as GPL 2.0), without adding further restrictions to the rights provided;
Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that license.
There are some things that you must shoulder:
You get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind;
If the software damages you in any way, you may only recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not recover any other damages, including those called "consequential damages." (The state or country where you live may not allow you to limit your liability in this way, so this may not apply to you);
The SimPL continues perpetually, except that your license rights end automatically if:
You do not abide by the "give back to the community" terms (your licensees get to keep their rights if they abide);
Anyone prevents you from distributing the software under the terms of the SimPL.
